"Usually reliable, but lately I've been noticing more and more issues with the application. like the coloring pages no longer function. we tried switching to the computer versions and they constantly keep crashing on more than one computer. Kinda anoying. Fills its need for the most part. I'm glad we didn't do the subscription at full price.",
"So far so good. We did a 1 mo. free trial, and then it was $12.99 monthly. After another good month of my 2 kids enjoying this (3.5 and 6) I decided to committ to the annual plan they had a deal running and I paid I think around $45 for the full year. Good deal. There is an option to be able to get more feedback on their progress for an additional fee but it's not necessary for us and easy to skip. Easy for my kids to navigate and use. No problems thus far. üëå",
"Not sure what bugs are fixed, but the bugs are clearly present while using a tablet. There are not any graphics (have uninstalled and reinstalled abc mouse three times) and there is not a way to contact support. Edited: The issue has been addressed and corrected.",
"Was working great. We just upgraded to the yearly subscription a couple of days ago. Now, the app keeps crashing every time we open it. I'm not sure what the issue is. I've tried clearing the cache, and I will try uninstalling it now and reinstalling it to see if that works. My son loves this game, and we hope to have this fixed soon. Please help. Update: I just tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it and logging back into the app, but it keeps crashing.",
"During the registration be aware that after confirming your package ( month or year subscription) they continue to ask you if you'd like to ""upgrade"" for additional charges. I was asked if I wanted to ""upgrade"" to $59 a year instead of $12.99 per month and accepted, but it charged me for both! And then it asked me to upgrade for $20 more for the assessment. It didn't ask for any confirmation of payment, you click the button and it automatically charges you. No reviewing what you get first.",
"I wish I could give it 0 stars. Got the year subscription ($45) then it gives you so many pages trying to get you to upgrade which btw to monitor your child's progress is $100!!! We started using the ‚Äúlearning path‚Äù and within the first few ‚Äúlessons‚Äù one wouldn't load. I was talking with customer service for over an hour and her solution was to skip 7 of the lessons. We started doing more, again another wouldn't load. What's the point in paying $45 if you can't use it? Got a refund!",
"I canceled it last year. One year later, they charged me again. It's really annoying because this is the 2nd year I've gotten a charge from them when I had canceled it before! Cannot afford these annoying surprise charges when it was supposed to be settled last year. They say it's easy to cancel, but it's actually impossible. No matter what, they find a way to charge you again and feign ignorance. Their app crashes, so I can't even view the membership. Customer support is slow and awful, too.",
Parents section on every device all don't fit the screen right and don't click right. Only shows math progress no other subjects. When you are in the kids area you can not scroll. When you try to click the mouse and drag or slide your finger you have to drag the opposite direction and it messes up so you have to do it over and over to go down. I think this is a great concept but for it to be $50-$100 yearly it is missing quite a bit. I'm using this for homeschool and preschool aged kids.,
"While the content is decent for the price you (and millions of others) are paying, you'd think the app would run way smoother. The fact is, this doesn't. It crashes, freezes, and just generally bugs out far too much for the price. The fix for that shouldn't be uninstall and reinstall it should be a preventative measure.",
"I usually don't write reviews but man has this experience been frustrating! I signed up for ABCmouse due to the corona virus to get the kids learning something while they're at home quarantining and it has been a nightmare! The main issue is that the app consistently freezes. No matter what! I have to close the app and reopen to get it working again and then sure enough, they tap on something and... You guessed it. Frozen again! Not sure if you understand exactly how frustrating it is to have a 3 and a 5 year coming to you every 5 minutes screaming ""It's not working again!"" especially when you yourself are working from home or in a meeting. I'm definitely not continuing my subscription and would advise anybody else to look elsewhere until they get some solid developers on their app.",Category
"I love the idea of this, it really does teach my kids so much. However, it is incredibly buggy. It freezes often and just causes frustration. I use it on 2 different tablets, both with the proper system requirements and supposedly compatible. It's even worse because it is something I pay for yet only works about half the time. We are in an incredible age of technology, it really should work better.",
"The program is great, but the app is horrible. They made it so complex and built it so poorly that it's very difficult to navigate, it loads terribly slowly, and it often freezes or some aspects don't work. There is no ""home"" button within activities, so you have to go through possibly dozens of slowly loading pages to get to what you want. I'm considering getting a refund. (The app is free but the service is not, and if the app doesn't work then the program is useless).",
"Cancelled during the trial period primarily because the app runs very slowly (can take up to 30 seconds between screens, at which point my toddler loses interest or gets frustrated). Some activities wouldn't work properly and had to be restarted. Even at the discounted subscription price, I just didn't think that the content was worth it. That, plus the fact that you are bombarded with requests to upgrade just made ABC Mouse feel like a money grab. There are free apps that are better!",
"Honestly didn't even get to use it. The app is ""free"" but when you open it you have to sign up for 30 day free subscription and reading into it will automatically renew each month unless you unsubscribe and charge you. I was disappointed and after searching I didn't find anywhere in print that the subscription would cost money. I'm sure it's really great but I can't spend extra money on apps. I just feel it's a bit misleading.",
"I've had some issues with the app, but I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it. It seems when I download it from the website, is when I have issues. When i get it directly from Google play, I don't have issues. Not sure why. I also make sure to update the app frequently. This is by far the best app for my 3 kids(2, 4, 10yrs). My 10 year old still uses and loves it. Repetition is good. It's easy to navigate, even my 2 yr old does it by himself while I get my housework done. And it's so affordable!",
"There were no problems when signing up. My card information went in with ease. I was able to create a password and everything log in information. Once that was set up, the app became distorted. I wasn't able to see no one activity. Half of the screen was blacked out. After having so much trouble with the app on my laptop, I tried to use it on my phone and ran into the same issues. If it will not work properly then you can not complain bc you can't navigate through the app. Scam!!! Not Legit!",
"The app is great for kids, cute and educational, able to keep me 3yr olds attention. Unfortunately the app is too slow when moving from one area to another, and often freezes up. I have to shut it down and reopen it several times when she plays because it freezes so often. I didn't expect an app that you have to pay for to have so many bugs in it. I just bought a new phone, so I'm sure its the app having issues, not my phone",
"What happened? Have used this for a year, at least, for my daughter has been great. Can't even get it to work now. I stopped the app several times and uninstalled it. At most I can get it to say welcome, then it crashes. I tried to send feedback, tells me I'm not connected to a data service, which is not so. I'm in wifi and have an active data account.",
"Overall this is a grand educational app. One and only one problem I continually have is the book reading. Every time a book is read, at the finish the app hangs and will not progress past that point. you can back up and have it read it again, but it will not allow progression. I have tried every angle around the problem I could find. back up, try to step past it, go through the classroom, complete exit and shutdown. The shut down works but i have to stop the schooling for a bit to let it clear.",
"Highly Dissarisfied. Downloaded this app because my daughters absolute love it, even the commercials. i even bought a new chromebook just to have this app. and it looks like i am not the only one have the exact same issue with lagging, crashing, freezing, will not even open or load. there is something failing on your end and considering the cost of this learning app these issues should have been addressed a long time ago. Whats the point in having an app if you cannot use it! Frustration!",
"Listed as ""#7 top free."" Took a long time to load and then took me straight to a menu to register to try the first month free, then subscribe. There are no games available to just click and play. Free apps should be free with options to buy extras if needed. I don't mind paying for educational materials, but this is misleading and immediately turned me off.",
"This app has the potential to be an amazing resource for teaching preschool aged kids using fun and engaging games. Unfortunately, the app rarely works. We have tried repeatedly to open the app, both on a tablet and on a smartphone, and every time it has frozen and doesn't allow us to get to ""my learning path"". At other times it will randomly redirect us back to the login page. It is so frustrating!",
The app seems to freeze a bit which makes it annoying for my 3 yr old. she either just stops or every few min says its frozen and I have to close the app and completely restart it. Other than freezing I've noticed some things that look like they are part of the app send you to download another. I'm not sure if that's just because of how my daughter got to it or if it's just open somewhere in the app. Love the app over all it has helped with preschool and its helping my 2nd grader a little bit too,
"ABC Mouse is amazing! My daughter used it when she was young, and now my son is using it. They both started on Toddler Time and just excelled from there. It has been amazing. My son calls it his school. He loves the number games and the puzzles. We bought the assessment ad-on and it has been great. I did the assessment first with him and then he started the learning path. Each time he completes a level we go back and reassess, then if he needs extra practice we can work on it. It's great!",
"My kids have been using it for years. They have both been reading well ahead of their peers, and are otherwise academically well rounded. Entering Kindergarten, my son was reading at nearly the 2nd grade level. My 4 year old is reading without much help and learning to write legibly. I'm not a good teacher and they do it without prompting, so I credit this game. They have tried other learning apps but they got bored, but they're always happy about ABCmouse.",
"So far it is the promised fun we were hoping to add to our daughters school work. !It is very slow however with many glitches needing us to close and restart or wait a long time. We have multiple devices we've tried it on; we have upgraded to the highest quality Internet speed just for this (we don't use it for streaming or gaming) and still it's very slow. !It does seem to have many instructional videos and new things but they don't integrate into the learning path, you have to go searching.",
"I absolutely USED to love, love this app. until the update. We've tried experimenting with and getting used to it. The more we use it, the more it looks like many options are missing. My child used to like to color both the boy and girl pictures; listen to boy and girl books. This is no longer available. She used to listen to the different fun environment info & sometimes do the quiz after. That is no longer an option. The app has never been left hand friendly, but we've gotten used to it. Now it's not even child friendly.",
"It's a nice app but hopelessly buggy and slow and its not my device causing the problems. I'm constantly having to restart the program for my daughter because it freezes. Look at the reviews and you'll see this is a common complaint and it has been for years. Don't tell me to just get in contact with you, ABCMouse. This will only get fixed by hiring better programmers. edit: lowering review even further. Unbelievably buggy, freezes constantly. This level of junky programming is unacceptable.",
"Cancelled our subscription. The content is great, Unfortunately, the app ran so slow and poorly, that I found my child becoming disinterested while waiting for the next activity to load. We tried logging on from all of our devices both new and older. We also tried from our computer, and using both wifi and LTE connections. The results were always the same. This is what led to our cancellation. For what the content is, it should be running much faster. Especially on brand new devices.",
"My daughter is 2 (almost 3) and LOVES ""school"" time thanks to ABC Mouse! I've seen commercials for years, but I felt like she was too young for an online learning program. However, when I was having trouble motivating her to read or work on letters and numbers from workbooks, I thought I'd give it a try. Since we started a month ago, she's mastered counting to 10 and almost has her ABC's down independently. Maybe even more importantly, she picks up books all the time now and loves reading!",
we registered for ABC mouse on a family member's computer my 4 year-old loved it and didn't want to stop playing it. it is an amazing system to use for fun learning. we don't have a computer at home so I down loaded the app. The app is horrible compared to my computer experience. if she clicks the learning path it just loads but never really loads. same thing happens for other areas. in the library section she will pick a book but the pages are plain with no words. Very disappointed.,
"I love it, all three of my children use it! It helps me realistically see where each one of them needs to focus more. My Eldest is in 4th but when i had her do the 2nd grade assessment it showed me an area of sentence structure she needed help in. The program is amazing! It immediately pulled practice activities and she retested the same night. As a parent any area your child needs to be sured up in academically you want to catch it sooner than later.",
"This app takes forever to load, my daughter doesn't have the patience to wait 30+ seconds between screens and frankly, neither do I. For a paid app it's ridiculous. I thought it was the device but have downloaded it on multiple devices with the same result each time. Super disappointed since the commercials make it seem like such a great learning tool for kids.",
"apps are ok, makes learning fun, but from my Samsung galaxy 9, or my iPad. it glitches it let's me delete an account then I try to set up a new one and it shuts off ( closes the app). then when I re open the app it won't let me finish making the avatar, and I can't delete the old one to make a new one on the account, there is no option. trying to set it up is more work than having your child play with it. not worth it.",
I just have it for a week yet. I got it for my 2 year old cause she seems to be behind in talking. Within this week I see so much progress. Not sure if it's because of this program but I'm satisfied. Update after 1 1/2 months. My daughter keeps getting better at speech. And she enjoys working with ABCMouse. She struggles with the painting part. Maybe I have to switch to a tablet cause we do it on the cell phone. Reading books is her favourite feature. Helped us alot during pacifier weaning time,
"This used to be amazing and work fantastically on all devices, but it has been nearly impossible to use on mobile devices--it barely loads, the features are not available or they freeze. I have a frustrated little person! Works fine on a PC, but we're rarely on a PC...",
"Update: I originally had issues with the app, but after finally finding out how to contact them, I was able to get the app working again. Although the website is good, it uses old tech (flash player) for a lot of the learning path. This may cause issues with some browsers and cause the app to not work properly. All-in-all, the app is OK but really needs some updating.",
"We loaded this app on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A. The app is buggy, slow, and on several occasions has spent 30 minutes + trying to load a module. In addition, it sometimes doesn't log my daughter's progress returning her over and over again to the same spot on the learning path. I would like the app to allow parents to help define the learning paths with focus on certain skills or modules.",
"Absolutely amazing, I love it. Although we are experiencing a global pandemic that leaves many of us uncertain as to when things will ever get back to normal. ABC Mouse has offered my toddler (4 year old) the perfect opportunity to learn preschool/headstart learning objectives across the board such as: reading, mathematics, shapes, colors and so much more. No I am not a spokesperson nor a marketing agent. I am just a proud parent. Thank you ABC Mouse üíûü•∞",
"App is a joke, it ALWAYS crashes! Tried on kindle, Samsung phone, and iPad and nothing works for more than 5 minutes before it freezes and crashes. It has the exact opposite effect on my 5 year olds learning from what I was hoping for. As soon as she gets into a lesson or two it crashes leaving her frustrated and upset. Such a rip off, won't be renewing this garbage.",
"***Edit: We had a technical issue that required quite the troubleshooting to resolve. The customer service was exceptional and after 24 hours we were able to resolve it. The app is obe of its kind and provide grear variety of educational activities and games. We love the app and used it for over a year. All of the sudden it stopped working. I reinstalled and even factory reset my device. Just emailed about pausing subscription, but wondering if others have this issue.",
"I would love to rate this app 5 stars. The lessons,stories,songs, etc, are great.!!! My 4 year old loves them. My issue is it glitches DAILY!!! It becomes frozen right in the middle of lessons. It is so irritating. But I have recently updated the app. Hopefully it fixes the problem. I subscribed for the free month and signed up for the 12.99/month subscription because we loved it so much. If the update does not help the glitches, Im discontinuing the sub and finding something more suitable.",
"One word to describe this app - GLITCHY! You know it's bad when your toddler wants to throw the device because of so many app bugs (and so do i). Tried the app feedback site, but it is pointless since I have this app on different devices - and it performs the same on each platform. The biggest glitch I hate is when he has completed an activity, but it doesn't go back to start another one. It stays on it forever until we have to close it out. This is now an everyday thing. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't help at all. This app feels like its underdeveloped.",
"I installed the app on my phone to see what was available for my daughter when she is old enough to navigate the app and immediately realized the app is completely locked down unless you sign up for their subscription service. I figured I would have to pay for advanced features or individual lesson packs, but would have the opportunity to look at the cirriculum and how its organized before I made a decision. Nope. They want that commitment to the subscription before you do anything. The ""one month free"" requires a credit card number to get started. No thanks. I will just use the handmedown leapfrog stuff my mom gave me.",
"Used to have this service and picked it back up. Marked difference in how well it performs. Thought it just didnt like droids but trying to run it on pc browser is worse. The buttons that do work take forever to load, if they load at all. All my platforms are updated and work fine with other programs. Really disappointed.",
"What is happening with this app, because it wasn't like this the last time I used it over a year ago? Is there some accessibility option I need to turn off? From the start at login it uses some integrated keyboard instead of my phone's keyboard and there's a robotic voice on 2x speed narrating everything you do and giving instructions. Typing on the keyboard is garbage. The poor touch interface isn't just the keyboard, but everywhere in the app. Stick to the web browser.",
I have three kids who use this app and I use it on three different devices which are all different brands. In the middle of a game or activity it will kick them off or at the end of their learning path when they are picking an award. They get extremely frustrated because in about a 15 minute period it has crashed for my 7 year old 4 times.,
"This app has been a great experience for my kids so far. Having all the same features and functions from desktop to touch device suited even for the smallest of hands. We don't use it as strictly an educational tool, though that's the main purpose, but we also use it for story time all the time and for general free time because they love the games too.",
"Trouble Getting Things to Load My niece has been trying to do the Learning Path and other activities, but once she clicks them, it just stays on the white background and never loads. We've been having this issue for a little over a week now, and there are no pending updates for the app. We had been using the app since the school cancelations because we don't have a printer to print off her school work. This is our first time using ABC Mouse and she really enjoys it. I hope you guys find a fix.",
"We downloaded ABCMouse because our school was closed due to covid-19. It has been frustrating since day one and I feel horrible for anyone who paid full price for this! It lags, it's slow, and you can't get past the loading screen half the time. As a teacher I could not see using this in class, especially with elementary kids. I have tried going through their website only to get error messages.",
"I just uninstalled and reinstalled, switched his level and it's back to level 7. This issue has literally existed for years! The application allows kids to just push buttons and advance past activities not learning the material. Then at a certain point that stops working and they have to answer correctly. Each time my children get to a point they can't work through any longer I have to contact customer service. Each time I get the run around about uninstalling that doesn't work.",
"Cannot cancel. Tells me to reinatall but won't let me. I've freed up 2gigs and restarted my phone. This has been going on for a month! Also, it was confusing navigating the app as a child or adult unless you pay extra for a child eval for customized placement/experience. Was a waste of money from the start. There are free learning apps out there that are way better and more user friendly.",
"My two-year-old loves this app, and it's the only one she uses. I always start her out on her personal journey when we open the app and she'll do a few activities before anything else. It allows her to do anything from reading and math to art and music... She can even learn about animals and care for different digital pets. The worst thing she does is go shopping with her tickets to buy the same thing multiple times; but I can just redirect her myself in a matter of seconds.",
My toddler loves it & not having to worry about pop up ads being clicked on is such a blessing. I also have seen the impact on my child's education in a good way. Only things I don't like as a parent is the lack of competition in some of the games as I've noticed you are always a winner but hope that changes as my child gets further down the road. I also don't like how you can quickly skim through books and still be credited for it. Lastly not being able to sell unused items bought with tickets,
"Paid and can't even get the app to open Updated from 1 to 4 stars: their customer service was pretty good. After explaining to me that my phone wasnt compatible with the app, they granted me a refund, ended my subscription and sent email proof that everything was taken care of. Which is more than I can say for alot of other companies that pretty much scam you out of your money",
Horrible. I just bought a year subscription and downloaded the app. I can't even get the app to open. It keeps glitching and exiting the app. If it doesn't do that it doesn't load at all. Just keeps spinning. Very mad since I just bought a year subscription.,
"My DD is 6yrs old and wanted try it. I had signed up previously when she was 3 yrs old but I was charged the annual fee only a couple of few days into the trial period. This was thankfully refunded. On this occasion the month trial was good so I signed up for the monthly, however, Ive seen another charge thats coming out of my bank account, as well as the ¬£12.99 monthly charge, of ¬£3.95. I have no idea why I'm being charged this so I'm cancelling again as I didnt sign up for this.",
"We loved this app until the most recent update when it abruptly stopped working. It crashes constantly and freezes my entire device. Extremely frustrating as it was not a cheap app, and my son really enjoyed it and was learning.",
"I wish they could get this to stop crashing on my phone. I pay for a yearly subscription, and my child can't even use it half the time because it keeps crashing and closing. Only one that we can use it on is a tablet that has to be connected to a charger 24/7 for use.",
"I got ABCmouse for my daughter, who was struggling with her schoolwork. Since downloading the app, my daughter's schoolwork has significantly improved. I'm so thankful for ABCmouse. She loves all the little side adventures and the tickets. Oh, the ticket dance she does is excellent. Our whole experience has been magical. Thank you ABCmouse!",
It tends to freeze A LOT. It has great games and is fun for my 5-year-old. He gets frustrated because he'll complete an activity and it freezes and he loses his progress,
I'm having the same issue. My son hasn't been on for months and now it crashes each time he opens it. It's been updated and reinstalled. Continues with the sam3 issue.,
Kinda easy to use for most of the games. I do watch the children purposely make mistakes because those sounds are more fun to hear than the you got it correct sounds.,
Really unhappy with the app.. Everytime I open its throws me out and I also have no way of cancelling the subscription because I can't stay logged on long enough. Plus I cannot cancel through Google. Really disappointed. And I am just losing money üôÅ,
Every time I open the app it closes itself out won't even let me register do anything a waste of my money if I could give it 0 Stars I would just wanted to add more after I finally got on my laptop and finish registration have finally been able to get the app to work somewhat on the tablet but yet get to work on my phone,
"I bought this for my 3 years old son for $50. Worked only for a week now it only crashes and doesn't work. Don't buy it, it isn't worth it!!!!",
Absolute trash. Can't even load the app to cancel my subscription. I have installed and reinstalled it several times and can't get past the start-up. Do not recommend it at all.,
"This app is great for educating toddlers, but it has too many bugs. My daughter can play all the games, but when she clicks the learning path, it turns the app off. If this can't be fixed immediately, then I would like a full refund.",
"Great little app for kids, seems to be a very honest company that even sends reminders they will renew soon! I used it during the summer and will be returning next year! Thanks you.",
Content of the app is great but the app is very slow and taking long time to load when shifting from one activity to another. App needs improvement.,
App not working! How sad! Recently Updated app and app keeps closing upon opening. How can my child learn if the app won't stay open. I paid for a year of service and I'm not able to use what I paid for,
It keeps crashing and I've contacted customer support on chat twice but they stopped responding to me and therefore it's still unresolved and I paid for a year and cannot use this app.,
The app does not work. It keeps crashing. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Force stopped. Restarted my phone. It doesn't work.,
"Since downloading, the app keeps crashing and will not load. I guess i will not make it past the free trial unless things improve.",
App consistently glitches when you try to log in then you input your payment info get a new password and then it does the same thing all over again. DO NOT BUY TOTAl waste of your money,
ALERT!!! Don't bother using it!!!! They deduct your money while they claim to have given you a trial period for their premium version. And they a very poor refund policy where they never refund your money. Almost all users i have seen and heard complain about this.,
Took the trial period but when itry to get into the app it lets me log in but freezes or cuts out entirely i went onto wwwabcmouse to cancel subscription but its telling me to download app what a load of rubbis if anyone from abcmouse is reading this please cancel subscription,
"It's not working. The app just shuts down and freezes like a 1990s video game on Super Nintendo. I've uninstalled the app. Then, it reinstalled the app. Still continued to freeze up. Hope I get an email from the support team and get it fixed. My 4 year old wants to continue her learning experience.",
It runs faster on my five old tablet than regular kid games. It only takes a few seconds to load. No performance issues whatsoever. My daughter somewhat enjoys the games and loves the videos. She eagerly plays the educational games in order to earn tickets for her pets. She would get bored if it weren't for the tickets- genius idea. It's fantastic for my three year old.,
"ABCmouse- PLEASE CONTACT ME ABOUT A REFUND!!! Saw this advertised on PBS Kids so many times.. And while the idea of this game is wonderful, this game is constantly freezing up and glitches. And its difficult to get out of this game when these issues arise. Just purchased this today and spent around $90 between the annual membership cost and the parent add on to see the results of my kids progress. I wish I would have did the free trial first. Lesson learned.",
"Slow, buggy Ap, with No solutions at $12.99/month... Once we got done with the 1st world, it got buggy and very slow. We spent more time waiting then actually learning. Customer service was no help and only refunded us one month (used 4 in total) and cancelled my subscription without my consent. I only wanted the payments paused until the bug was fixed but customer service said that was not an option. Very disappointing, the ap showed great promise for a learning platform.",
"We signed up yesterday, and the app is extremely glitchy. It freezes or opens to a blank screen and there's no way to get back to the main page. Our internet is fast and we've tried on multiple devices. Definitely will be canceling.",
"The website just charged me 19.75 which I find pretty strange as none of their programs cost that. The app hardly ever works right. The website, once you log in, wants you to download the app and that's the only option you have for navigation on the site. I'm very unhappy with abc mouse on the whole. Update: I contacted the company and they tried to tell me my account had been terminated in April and asked for the last four digits of my card. They've stopped responding so far.",
"Paid $30 USD for the annual plan a year ago. The payment was declined because the they have on file expired. Now they are asking for $80 a year. Also, I've never agreed that they'll save the payment information or use it to charge me for a renewal. Both of these issues are really suspicious. Why is this organization trying to scam people like this?",
"This app use to be good, now it's a nightmare. I had this issue a few months back and it's happened again. I open the app but it's stuck on the loading screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it three different times and it isn't working. This is getting beyond annoying.",
"I paid today and the app won't even load. Just kicks me out every time. Very frustrating, I'd like a refund!",
"SCAM!!! SCANDALOUS THEIVES!!! CON ARTISTS!!! They have taken money for products they promised and never delivered. I asked for a refund and they couldn't deliver on that either... Just stay away from this kinda of things, as it's all just a scam... BTW, their programs are not good for keeping children entertained, are so very outdated, and exhibits lack of quality.",
With the new update my son can't use it will not let us in and app will not fully load. I can't even cancel without the app.,
"All I can say is THANK YOU to the creators of this app! In a world full of apps that want to shape our children, I appreciate this amazing app that instills good quality education with fun!",
"ABC is an excellent educational app designed to provide engaging and entertaining content for children. However, as many low-end budget Android devices are limited in terms of their hardware specifications, users may experience difficulties when using this app. These devices may experience lags or crashes while running the app, which can make it challenging to use. It's essential to remember that these issues are not the fault of the app developers but rather the hardware limitations of budgets",
"Great app! My kids love the games, they are educational and keep them engaged! Unfortunately lately the app is crashing lately",
App keeps crashing since latest update. Really frustrating when I'm trying to have child use to keep educational mind to him.,
Just signed up for it and I can't even open the app! Constant crashing! This better be fixed quick or I'm canceling. Can't even get 2 seconds of experience.,
"My son has been using ABCMouse since he was a baby. This app has helped him tremendously especially since I homeschool him. This app has helped him advance. He knows so much and is only 2 and a half. I recommend any mother or father who has a child or children to download this app, get that subscription and let your child or children get to learning. There is so much for them to do in this app especially if you work from home and just want your child or children to learn, educationally.",
I want my money back. I bought a year subscription just for the app to crash every 5 seconds,
To many glitches. When an assignment is complete the children get the joy of seeing that green checkmark letting them know it has been completed. Sometimes the checkmark is not given making hard to progress. FIX PLEASE!,
"App never wants to load. It keeps crashing, and it doesn't want to load some activitys.",
Ok overall.. My only issue with the app is that it is dependent on internet connection. You have to wait doe loading slas well There are spots where that is not possible. Needs to be usable with or without internet to keep the fun going.,
Really tried to have this work for my kids. Don't bother with this app. It lags and that's if it even bothers to open. I'm seriously so frustrated. I've tried to make this app work for 2 years now. I've PAID MONEY for it not to work at all for 2 years. Definitely disappointed.,
I'm already in third grade so I decided to install ABCmouse because the ad looked cool but then I noticed that I had to pay or something and I'm like I'm not paying for all that some like maybe in the morning I can tell my mom about this and I got school tomorrow because I just spended two weekends of fun because I went to the children's museum here in Baltimore Maryland it was a great fun but it was short because they close pretty early and this is me from the year 2021 signing out seya later,
The app kept crashing and I was told by the developer to uninstall and reinstall and restart the tablet. Did that and the app is still glitchy. Don't waste your money. Also the learning path is mostly just videos for the kids to watch.,
"This is wonderful options for kids. LEARNING. it's fun, educational and they are having fun while learning numbers, letters, animals, colors everything. It's great for in on a road trip.",
Was working great for years... lately something is not right. Tried uninstalled... well we may have fixed it...,
"Horrible app. So when I try to sign in and put in my email and password, It would say it""s incorrect. I needed help remembering my password, I didn't receive my email, and I've been waiting for the email to come, it didn't. DOM'T WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS APP!!!!!",
"Always crashes, slow to load. Very frustrating to use.",
"The app does not seem to work. Not even once I was able to use it. I've already unistalled and reinstaled but it still crashes ever time, and I already paid the membership through the website.",
My daughter and Grandson both used this app. This last year before they started kindergarten and they had fun and learned more than I realized,
"I don't understand why such a popular kids learning service has such a terrible app. Telling my 3&5 year old to ""let it load"" and ""stop pressing things"" is not what I pay a subscription for, so not renewing when it comes up. Such a shame that all that content is basically wasted because it won't load properly and takes forever. It makes all of us so sad.",
"This app is virtually unusable on both my Android tablet and Android phone, every click takes seconds to respond to the point my kids get very frustrated and give up and go to a different app. Very disappointed.",
The abc theater portion does not work. None of the videos play.,
I can't stop playing this is addicting thank you this is my favorite app ever thank you for this whoever made it it's the hardest part is choosing what to play amen this is the best game ever,
Just did the latest update and now the app keeps shutting down before the it even loads up.,
Terrible connection issues. Makes the application unusable since you need to sign in to do anything. Cannot connect on any of the devices in the home.,
"I purchased this for two of my children spending nearly $200. Well NO ONE in my household could figure out how to even use the app affectively. I contacted support for a refund due to my extreme dissatisfaction, but they told me they could not offer refunds. I paid for a year for both of my kids and neither of them have even used the program. A complete and utter rip off.",
I've had this for over 2 years. The kids understand it and the games change often to keep their interest,
"This is the slowest learning app on all our tablets. We've loaded it onto three different ones to see if its a device issue. The kids love it, have fun and the activities are great, but they give up quickly when it lags for more than 30 seconds. Any tips for getting it to run faster or is it just getting a lot more users slowing down the system because of the lockdowns? Hope we get to enjoy it. I'm not sure I'd pay to renew next month with these problems.",
Not good. Bot bad. Definitely has some connection issues. Some devices of ours sometimes won't connect at all. But connect fine on other devices. Constant freezing. Glitches. Bugs. It's slow and takes a little while to load. Especially on older devices. Causes impatience with my toddler waiting for the next assignment to load. But this has been a really good app in regard to her learning and it has so much potential. Get rid of the glitches and do some development of this software,
"Horrible app. Can't get a monthly, yearly price without adding my credit card. If I do that, I'm locked in. You need a better explanation of price listing. I added now deleting, for that reason.",
"Yeah, this app is Great and all, my 10 year old loves it! But it's about the glitching. I tried multiple times to reset on his tablet, but it's still frozen. I need you to fix this",
"Got the app and haven't been able to open it, NOT EVEN ONCE, keeps crashing",
Extremely buggy. This app crashes and freezes constantly. It's causing my 4 year old to get frustrated to the point she no longer enjoys the app. Buyer beware. I'm using a Galaxy S21.,
Garbage! Crashed multuple times within the first 10 minutes. Not helpful with a crying toddler!,
My daughter likes this app but I can't get it to work. I've even uninstalled and restarted my phone but it just closes out or doesn't even load):,
"After downloading, I was looking forward to browsing through the content as an early childhood educator. However I could not even have it sign in properly. I went to forgot password and it popped up in order to input a new password through a sent email link. But before I could even input anything the page sent me back to the download page. A very disappointing letdown. Until this is fixed I genuinely can't rate this any higher.",
"App not working most of the time. For the past week , unable to access.",
Glitches galore! Quit working all together . It no longer opens.,
My 1 year old and 3 year old love ABCmouse! My 3 year old is extremely smart so he doesn't use it anymore the 3 year olds name is Finn and the 1 year olds name is Leah,
"Better than most classroom setting/multi-subject learning apps out there. Straightforward, encouraging, fun, safe, informative, useful and quality learning. I was really impressed, the only unfortunate part is that it is definitely geared specifically to the USA eg. the map is American only. When pressing on North America, my kiddos are unable to learn about their home in Canada. I would definitely like to see a more worldly version in the future, especially including a Canadian update.",
I totally recommend this app and I'm not being sarcastic it has everything your child needs so install it it's a very good app,
App won't run. Shows start up screen then closes out.,
I purchased 1 year membership but the app keeps freezing and crashing.,
"Love this app, only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because app crashes everytime we open",
"Bit crowded, and funny how theres lots of options for poc children but only 2 white kids.",
ABCmouse is an excellent learning tool.,
I got this for my 2 year old but was using a phone so everything was small and difficult for her to tap on which was frustrating so I cancelled my subscription and was refunded (only used it for a day) I think this would work better on a larger screen. I will definitely be signing up again when she's much older.,
"I love ABCmouse, my 3-year-old has had it for two and a half years now. and her education is very accelerated and she has fun learning. The app has more than learning engagement exactly what the kids need.",
"It constantly crashes, making it impossible and frustrating for my kid to use it. When it works, he loves it, but I haven't been able to use it for weeks now. Help please!",
"I'm having issues with the app. When I open It just crashes, and I have deleted everything. I want to stop my subscription until it's resolved.",
Can't guide engagement. My kids stopped being interested in the actual content once they found they could feed the class hampster and change the kids clothes. It was quite irritating that I couldn't make them earn the ability to do either. I'd ask them to do math or reading and income back to them playing with the stupid hamster! Waste of money!!!!,
I had bought this two weeks ago. I have been unable to log in on any device. Requested a password changed recieved it and all it will ask me to download app which i have on my phone. I am even unable to download the app on any other devices .,
"My son is thriving while using abc mouse. Its building his confidence, and helping him become excited to learn. Thank you abc mouse for assisting me in creating a little life long learner.",
App Crashes/ Freezes. It happens on a daily basis. Please assist me on this matter as I have already paid in full for the year. Thank you!,
Can play about 2 games then it crashes or freeze. Would love to have this as a take anywhere but it's not stable.,
App crashes on start up since update and this is very frustrating for myself and my daughter not being able to use it.,
"How much would I expect to learn from an app that can't even spell ""learning"" correctly in its ad? I'd post a screenshot if it would let me but yeah a misspelling from a LEARNING app does not inspire confidence lmao",
"Sadly, I loved this app more then my kid. Maybe I tried too young. Also really difficult to cancel payment, currently still paying for this app and haven't used it in months, when I find free time maybe I'll be able to figure it out but they made it sound easy but maybe I haven't had enough patience or time.",
"What happened to the other apps that were supposed to be included,?? There was supposed to be a science app & other apps mentioned & shown when I purchased a year subscription for all my kids but the other 3 weren't anywhere in Google play?",
Excellent learning tool from a very young age. I use it everyday with my daughter. She is 3 years old and we use it from 6 months. Thank you for all your efforts. I highly recommend it.,
Operation is not exactly flawless. Used this app while I had another child doing gymnastics. See ads touting the app as being a game changer in educating your child. These claims are laughable. My kid became bored with this rather quickly and I can't say I've noticed any changes. It's far more educational to do hands on activities with your kids than stick them in front of a tablet while you stare at your phone?,
Keeps crashing after the update.,
"Well I really wanting to like this, but I can't get it to work at all on my phone. It sometimes go to the log in and soon as I do it got to the yellow screen where it stays or totally shuts itself off... I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but get the same problems each and every time. I just paid for the full subscription and this is a waste of alot of money if it isn't going to work for my son to learn with.",
"This app stopped working several weeks ago! My 4 yr old loves it, so she's always disappointed because it won't load! And when it does load, it's only for a few seconds before it shuts back down. I've uninstalled and reinstalled over and over again, to no avail. It simply doesn't work. I guess it's time to purchase Noggin instead. So frustrating and is now a total waste of money.",
App worked great until recently it won't load and it seems like it crashing all the time.,
"The online version is awesome. The app, not so much. It has been downloaded to multiple devices and has yet to work. As much as I would love to use it for car and airplane rides, it just isn't compatible. I have downloaded it androids, iPhone, desktop and laptops and it's the same result.",
"What is going on ABCMouse? I know $'s not the problem. When I first logged on it was great, and I just gave the benefit of the doubt, telling myself it'll get fixed, that was 5yrs ago. Both browsers &app are buggy, overheats, slow,& have corrupt sound bytes that would replay even after they where petting pets. The concept for this app is great, now bring the concept to life. Please, optimization is greatly needed. It's frustrating paying for something that is not working half the time.",
"The app is very slow compared to almost any app. Also, the game is supposed to be for kids, but an adult has to intervene in-between each short game to get it set back up. Why not make the games continuous so the kids can enjoy some play? Why make small continue buttons and interrupting messages in the middle of play when the young child hasn't yet learned to read? My 3 children think its boring and frustrating. Anyway, my kids asked me to complain about this specifically so I did üòÉ",
"Extremely slow, sometimes we are unable to use the app at all. Only used it maybe 2 or 3 times for the past week because we can't seem to get it to work and when it does, it's so slow. Both my girls have lost interest. I honestly think the people giving great ratings are paid to or something. The app is ok. My husband is a teacher and says there are other better, engaging options for children. We will most likely cancel.",
"We love ABC mouse. Our kids enjoy it a lot, and they are learning, which is great. I am frustrated, though, that the most recent update now requires Android v.5, which means our tablet no longer works for ABC mouse, and we don't have enough devices in the house for the kids to use without it. :-( I feel super frustrated.",
"This is a great app for young children, but every time since the update, that I open the app, it's very slow & doesn't work on my tablet or phone, keeps freezing up & saying ""bad gate error."" it is really frustrating. I pay to use this every month for my foster son. I would love to see this get fixed. Never had any problems with it until after the update. My tablet now says his app is not optimized for this device. Samsung Tab E",
"Needs improvement. My 2 yr old can't read, so there's some parts where I wish it would tell him what it is he is clicking. Like when he clicks a certain letter, number, color, etc. I have to tell him what it is. Which defeats the purpose when I might as well teach him myself.The puzzles are not challenging. He can just tap it and it will automatically go where it's supposed to. The purpose of a puzzle is to challenge them. This doesn't do that. I wanted to love this but I'll be canceling.",
"This apps connectivity stability is garbage. Very very bad. Constantly while my daughter is working on her school work on it, it just goes a blank screen while loading the next learning path spot. Like I would say every 2nd - 3rd spot on learning path. It freezes and no it's not my phone I run a Samsung galaxy S9+ with the best specs of any phone unless a gaming phone and always in an otterbox. So cant go their",
"I have had a subscription for almost 2 years now. My boys have benefited from all the at home learning activities. Rewards are great because it keeps them motivated to keep learning. Also if I may make a suggestion. Instead of accumulating so many repetitive items for their ""room"" or ""character"", they earn special books to read, or coloring pages, something that keeps them still learning. Still... I love this app for my kids!",
"My review is more on the tech aspect as well as unauthorized charges. It runs extremely slow and tends to freeze up not only on a desk top but especially on a tablet/iPad. We actually had this problem 6 years ago when using it for my oldest sons, I just hoped that was no longer the standard. I ended up cancelling before my trial period was over as we could never use it because of the freezing, then deleted the app. I was charged days later (on what would have been the new month) for $9.95 and $3.95. Now trying to redownload the app and figure out what's going on its saying I cannot do so. I cant even access the app and their online customer service is extremely limited. Disappointed years ago and disappointed now.",
Slow and has too many bugs. Not woth the money,
"Its getting 1 star just because its almost imposible to cancel the subscription. I had to go about it multiple ways and had to contact customer service to cancel it. I only cancelled because its expensive but the program itself is ok, not great but its ok.",
"It's great for my daughter when it works. It is constantly freezing, especially during the balloon pop games which causes lots of frustration. It works better on the tablet versus my phone, but still freezes constantly so we have to close the app and reopen it several times.",
At first I thought it was just my computer having issue but after reading these other ratings I see that it's not only me having issue with this app. My kids and I have had ABCmouse for a long time. I love the app when it works but my kids have a hard time really using the app. I have tried to work it in to our schooling plan while the kids are learning from home and it has been more pain then game. It's like working with old school dail-up internet. If the app works correctly it's fully worth it,
"Kids love it! But there are so many bugs. It freezes, and some of the activities do not work property. If things do not get smoothed out, I will have to cancel my subscription. I cant keep paying for something that frustrates my kids during learning instead of making learning fun. Other than the glitches and bugs, the kids enjoy the app and they do learn something new every day they open the app.",
"I downloaded this app to get my 3yr old on track and prepare him for Pre-K. Unfortunately, I am unable to log in to the app. I have tried several times only to receive the same message of incorrect email or password. Trying on the web browser I am able to log in, but the same credentials aren't working within the app. Very disappointed in this app.",
"I'm very surprised by the low ratings some people are giving this app. We've had it for almost a year now and haven't had a single issue with it. Bought the one year subscription and it's wonderful! We have two kids using it, 5 and 9, they both enjoy it for their technology time. The only thing that I would love to see is further levels. Technically, our 9 yr old is past the highest level but she still uses it for fun. Otherwise, no complaints!",
"It's 90% coloring. If you own crayons do not pay for this. The ""games"" are too slow for my 3 yr old even up 2 levels higher. The load time is ridiculous. The few games that are decent are very short and repeat the exact same order when replayed. Could be decent if they removed the ""paint"" and condensed the games into more than 1 letter at a time",
"I have used this for years with my students and grandchildren. It's layout and lesson plans are exactly how I plot out my own lessons. It would be very helpful, though, to have a way for the teacher to make lesson plans and adjustments for students on the app. It is not always convenient to drag out the laptop to go on line to make these changes.",
My 2 girls love this app & it has helped with their speech.,
My son loves this app but now it won't even stay open. Keeps closing right after it loads. So frustrating!,
My daughter loves the app and I love the material it covers. The only reason I rate it 3 stars is the puzzles being my daughters favorite activity and there not being any option to set a default difficulty level on the puzzles. This lets the default level of the puzzles be much to difficult for most children above 2 years old. I would not usually weight that so heavily if I knew that ABCmouse hadn't been asked for this feature for several years. If this were fixed I would give this app 5 stars.,
"Your app absolutely sucks. I have tried using the app on a cell phone, iPad, computer and it doesn't work. I signed into it 1 time and then it started freezing up, so I closed the app out restarted the device and now it just sits on the ABC mouse loading page. I have tried using the app on older devices and newer devices and everytime it doesn't work properly. You guys charge all this money to use this app but yet it doesn't even run.",
Runs insanely slow. They really need to update this app because being paid for it should not be running as slow as it does. Ridiculous. The website won't even load right and the app is pretty worthless as well because getting anything to load takes to much time. We are paying the subscription and majority of the time is spent waiting for anything to load. This should be free.,
I have been trying for almost 20 minutes to open the app. They took my money and let me set up the account but the app continues to crash over and over. As soon as it gets on the main screen it says the app isn't working and I can close or wait. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times with no improvement. I need my money back for the subscription I'll never be able to use at this point.,
"THE WORST!! My daughter was using it and she seemed fine with it. My problem is with billing. How dare they mess with people's money?! I canceled the subscription after some time. After I canceled, we never reinstalled it or intend to pay for something we are not using. Months after cancelling, ALL OF A SUDDEN, they start billing me! To this day no one reinstalled it. So why bill me?! I emailed. They said they would refund even though it isn't the policy, I got nothing. I emailed again, ZERO!!",
"Nice games and learning, but please do something about UI responsiveness and loading times. 5 seconds delay until it reacts to a tap on the screen is just horrendous, especially for little kids who just don't have patience.",
"This app is trash. It takes FOREVER to load and/or most of the time it NEVER loads. When it does, it crashes. It's all repetitive activities and nothing but ""coloring"". There's nothing Spanish about it either!",
"It could be a good program if it were not so stupidly Difficult to navigate. Main app page does not even have an easy link to create new account. We have used it before and I had hoped they fixed navigation. Alas,",
"The pufferfish do not eat in the aquarium and my child is traumatized because she has tried everything she can to feed them. She's currently in tears becausethey're ""starving"". I am on a free trial and if this is not fixed before the end of the free trial, I am definitely not going to continue to pay for the service after the free trial. When you click on the pufferfish one of the pop up messages says that puffer fish eat special food but there is no option to buy special food for puffer fish.",
"What happened to the Abc Mous? App continuously crashes. Cant even get past the login page & its running HOT on my phone. I followed all of the recommended ""steps"" to troubleshoot. As a last ditch effort, I reached out to live chat support ""john"" - who just said ""thanks for the feedback - is there anything else I can help u with"". When I said I guess not, he just ended the chat. RUDE. WASTE OF TIME. The app has been uninstalled & I will not be resubscribing. Fix ur app issues & ur support team.",
"The interface is way too crowded and confusing/ overwhelming for young children. Even if you pay for a subscription you are not able to use the app unless you have internet connection. Which sucks if you are trying to use this while not in your house. Switched to Khan Academy Kids, it's free and has a much better interface for children.",
"Touch and Go at best. How fast does my internet need to be for this to work? Weather I'm on my laptop, phone or ipad, this app takes forever to open and as soon as it does, it freezes up on me. One star for how easy it is to use when it does work, the 2nd star for the 2 free months when COVID-19 started. As much as I want to give back by continuing my subscription, I just can't do it if it doesn't work.",
Signed up for free trial. Card immediately got charged and when I tried to log in(less then 5 mins after creating the account) it said my account had been disabled. When I tried logging in through the app it showed a blank loading screen for almost 20 mins. Completely unplayable. It was a great game through my daughters school last year which is why I tried to sign up. Don't bother as a parent.,
I've heard so many people sing the praises of this app but so far I'm not impressed. I feel like much of this can be found free elsewhere. Other changes I'd like to see is separate learning levels for math & reading. My kids picked up math super fast & are way beyond numbers 1-10 but still working on the alphabet & sounds. I am sure I could change the level for each activity they are doing but it would be nice if they could be set separately. So far it's unnecessary screen time. Paper is better.,
Keeps crashing!!! This is garbage.,
"I want to like this app but I just can't. I did the free 30 day trial and I don't think I will be continuing. The layout of the app is so messy and confusing, my 3 year old has a hard time navigating. Even I have a hard time finding things again. More 75% of activities never load and the app freezes all the time. I'm constantly having to restart the tablet to get it unfrozen (mind you it's a brand new tablet). I'm not impressed with the content. I've found other free apps that work/are better.",
I'm on my free trial now but if it doesn't stop glitching I will stop the use of this app. The program is awesome for kids but you can't get through the games without it glitching causing me to back out and restart the same game over and over again.,
The app was good at first and my son loves it but all of a sudden it just stopped working. It stays on the loading screen. I have uninstalled it several times and it still will not load. Please fix and I will change my rating!!! Edit: Its been two months now and the app is still not working. I send 2 messages to customer support and no one responded. I'm so dine with this app.,
"I like the app itself. Easy to use, fun activities and games. but I cancelled it before the 2 weeks trial was up. Only because we did not use it enough to justify paying a monthly subscription. Definitely worth paying for if you plan to use it often. mostly used on a Samsung tab 4 without any issues of the app freezing or shutting down.",
"Great for at home learning activities and fun for my little one. It's one year now and she has grown and even started reading at 4. Happy to adjust learning path based on her needs and pace at anytime. Thank you. A vast variety of videos, interactive activities, books, games, quizzes, and exploration. I love the mice crew (abc, do-ray-me, 123) and Nano bot! I wish we could have access to japanese version. Only spanish and English access in U.S....other than that great app!",
My son really likes it but he gets frustrated sometimes with some of the games and activities because the touch screen isn't always accurate. I also have to constantly reset the app because it freezes. Its a great tool to teach him with but if I'm not sitting with him he may ask me several times to help him with technical difficulties and we have brand new phones. For 10 bucks a month I would expect for there to be little to no techincal problems.. Also the computer version has many tech issues.,
My kid loves it. I think it is resource heavy,
"Update: Now the original desktop version freezes, very frustrating. The mobile app & new desktop version are slow and glitchy. My kids use both the desktop version, and the mobile app every day, and without fail, abcmouse freezes up. I'm currently looking for another program, because it's really annoying when kids lose patience and don't want to wait.",
"Terrible app very slow I thought it was my tablet but after trying on with many different devices I realized that it is the app. So slow don't waste time. Edit; still not working, very slow, keep crashes, not loading videos. I even restored the tablet and there is only this app running, but still no hope.",
"Pre subscribed for a year with the analytics for my 2 and 4 year olds. Works 25% of the time, freezes on login screen most of the time. Same on our iPad. Terrible experience so far, they need to fix - lots of options out there for educational apps, I can't recommend this at this stage.",
"Biggest down fall, you cant even delete your credit info. You get charge annually if you dont go in and personnally canncell it. Thinking that you pay for the subscription for a year and the year ends the subscription would stop, it doesnt. Paid for 2016 and didn't know I got charged for 17 and 18. Contacted customer support to remove credit info they cant even do that. Decent app",
"Ok, I havent had it long so not a deep end review. BUT! I wish someone address the fact that the kids can skip to the end of any video or song just to collect rewards.. my daughter is starting at the first age group and she is constantly skipping videos with that dial at the bottom of the screen... why isnt that disabled? I have to monitor her time on it to be sure she is watching/listening to everything. please fix!",
I loved the idea of this app and bought a year subscription for my daughter. She didn't get anything out of it and quickly got bored with it. I figured I'd just let my subscription runout and wouldn't renew. ABC mouse automatically reenrolled me for another year and charged my credit card. They did this without so much as a warning email. I contacted them the day after they charged me for a refund. They refused. Terrible customer service. Save yourself the money and pass.,
"I pay for this app on my daughter's tablet. I'm really on the fence about it currently, it is very slow and freezes a lot, and my daughter gets really frustrated with it. I am wondering if it is worth the money. We have given up on it a lot and just worked out of a BrainQuest Workbook and Hilights Workbook for preschoolers. It's disheartening watching her get so frustrated with it freezing all the time and the activities are really repetitive.",
"Loving the improvements. I've been a paid subscriber for years and had a good experience but the recent improvements put it over the top for us. Specifically the classroom (anxiously awaiting new episodes!). Also, for us, investing in the assessments added a lot of value to our experience. It allows me to better tailor my son's learning.",
I love using this app but it has been malfunctioning for quite some time now. My son loves the app but has not been able to use it. We can open the app but once its open the screen never goes to the beginning where he needs to click on his name. It flips from horizontal to vertical and never tuens back around.,
"Honestly it doesnt teach anything at all. It keeps them entertained for a min, but doesnt teach anything useful. The learning path is repetitive, but not in a ""memorizing"" way. Its more annoying to them than anything. It has them do a puzzle, a coloring page, another puzzle, a story/song, a couple games all dedicated to 1 letter each level of the learning path but the kids retain nothing bcuz it repeats so much every level that they become bored. I suggest the RVstudioapps for kids for free",
"This app ABC mouse is the best app for little kids that like learning, it goes up to a range of kindergarten and higher, and it's perfect for your kids. If they want to spell English grammar, it's really perfect for kids that really like learning, it has fun experiences and fun times with kids, which I love playing it myself, sometimes if no, one's looking, but he's a pretty up for you. And I know you would sir playing a dude.",
"Fails at doing the most simple thing - keeping content at the level chosen. My autistic 3 year old likes to do things on his own, but the only way for him to stay within his skill set is to do the learning path, and he likes to be able to choose the games and activities on his own instead, especially when he sees the banners advertising them, which leads to him getting on games that are way too difficult and upsetting him. Why is the content not the chosen level all across the app??",
"Horrible experience!! I downloaded it and paid for the annual subscription two years ago. It was renewed twice.. It never worked, my daughter would always get frustrated and end up throwing the device! I've unistalled/reinstalled it many times on all devices it's a great concept but broken app. Save your sanity and just don't go with this app.",
"Seriously lags loading every screen. My 5 year old loses attention before she can actually use it. The parent access *never* loads, so no way to cancel subscription. I have been billed since March for a product my child refuses to use because it is so cumbersome. Even when the screen finally loads the activities do not hold her interest long. We have used three different devices, all with the same result. I sincerely wanted to love this and gave it several chances. Disappointed is an understatement.",
"Our daughter always wanted to play games that teach letters and numbers, which is great! But what makes this app not great is how much content your child can choose from. At first she was just playing the educational games, but then she discovered the ""pet"" area and spent all her time there, then she found the cartoon videos and that's all she does -- watch cartoons. They are educational in a way, but at 2 she's not retaining a lot about the social structure of Scottish castles in the past.",
"Extremely disappointing! Paid for this app for my daughter and it is absolutely awful. Takes forever to load, for some reason the internet won't connect but will work for every other app, we try to draw and it works maybe 1/4 of the time. It works just as horrible across all devices (kindle, ipad, galaxy phone and laptop). For the amount of money paid I was REALLY hoping my little one would take something away from this, if it were to actually work maybe she would? Contacting doesn't do a thing.",
"My daughter did not like this at all. Theres no real organization, just very scattered all over the screen. She got overwhelmed because theres so many settings with just the coloring pictures. She said it's a bad game and need a new one. I agree. She flew through the first couple lessons, realized she could just keep pressing next without doing the lesson or anything, and still received tickets/prizes?? What is the lesson there? Overall 0/10 would not recommend. Stick to the free apps. Also slow",
my son is 2 yrs old and loves the puzzles n coloring even tho there are too many buttons for him to press and change the styles and sometimes it doesnt want to color. the songs and videos are too long for him to stay still and pay attention to so i REALLY have to sit there and watch the videos with him or he will stop the video and have to restart the whole thing just to go to the next level. the app itself is great if your child is advanced enough. I like some of the activities they have!,
Always freezes or crashes. Not sure why I pay services that don't even work the way it should. And I tried signing up for the free trial and had to provide credit card info. And signed up for the 6 months after they were pushy to sign up for something and they charged my account right away so technically I should have 7 months on my subscription. But the dang thing doesn't load for me to check that status.,
"This company is a scam, after reading other reviews I see that I'm not the only one that had a ridiculously hard time trying to cancel and getting the run around. You can only do it through the app and when I tried logging in there was a talk back function and the page wouldn't work. Every other page worked just fine. The chat support gave me a hard time, I'm sure they are trained to do so. App is all over the place and not focused enough for little ones to stay on track. I would not recommend!",
We've had minor issues but they were remedied through their customer service. I'm glad we could continue with the app.,
"I downloaded the app and had to reload it many, many, many times before it actually worked went to go for the 30 day trial. Thank goodness I didnt pay because the app is so slow and now my tablet is stuck at the terms and conditions page and hasn't moved. I wouldn't suggest this to any one. It's been nothing but a hassle to try and work",
"My 4 year year old daughter loves this app. There are no random ads, no annoying pop ups just pure fun. We do the lessons together and when she doesn't want to do any more she can play in the classroom. No matter what she does she's always learning something which makes both of us happy. We've tried khan academy and that's nice also but this by far has been the most enjoyable! Does freeze sometimes but not enough to uninstall. Will definitely recommend to friends.",
Super frustrating to be paying for an app that constantly is kicking my son out. I'm even trying to write a complaint to possibly get refunded and the app keeps kicking ME off. Or shutting down and taking my son back to my main home screen. Hes only able to play on there for maybe 2/3 mins until hes coming back w/it crashed. Honestly until the bugs are fixed I wouldnt even bother with this app. Also if someone can contact me in regards to this issue that would be GREATLY APPRECIATED.,
"I don't know if it is a recent update or what but this app is currently performing really poorly. If I want to switch users, the screen goes blank. I am unable to switch student accounts in the app. I have to Uninstaller often. It is quite a bit of hassle. I love abcmouse but this app is really disappointing. Can't wait for the bug to be fixed.",
"Alright for the learning aspect. But being I have one of the newest tablets on the market, it says not optimized for device. But no other option but to download on this tablet. So if you could fix that issue that would be awesome. Little kids lose interest if it has to reload over and over or takes 5 mins to go between activities",
App is alright- feels like it is a decade behind though. It is the type of app that requires learning how it expects you to interact w/ it before you get started (not very intuitive- could use some effort on the user experience side of things). Definitely easier education options out there. My real issue with them is the incessant spam emails. These continue regardless of unsubscribing (both via logging into my account and also through the unsubscribe option in the emails). This is the worst spam experience I have had with a 'legit' source. Frustrating to see their emails in my spam box over and over again after repeatedly unsubscribing from all lists. For me this is enough to avoid an app. This is ultimately what prompted my review- I hope they change this practice. EDIT: Developer responded and suggested I contact them for assistance in unsubscribing. I have two issues w/ this: 1. When I use their unsubscribe options I get a 'successfully unsubscribed' confirmation. But it doesn't work. The real issue is that their unsubscribe routines do not work. This is where the help is needed- fix the inoperative unsubscribe routines. 2. With that response I am not entirely sure they read my entire review. But- given that I don't trust them with my email address- they are bold in assuming that I want to start emailing back and forth w/ them.,
"DECEITFUL. I saw an offer for a month's free trial after downloading app. However, I had to provide my credit card details to gain access to the month's free trial. I chose the yearly subscription which I believe would only come into effect after experiencing the month's free trial.To my surprise they immediately charged me for the year. Is this how a free trial work? That's not free trial it's a month free. False advertising. Extremely dissatisfied. Opening app and loading content is slow.",
Hardest app to cancel a subscription with ever!! Their customer support is lacking as well.,
"Ughh! I really REALLY wanted to love this app but it's pure trash. It won't even load on my phone, it just stays at the yellow screen. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled about 5 times!! On his kindle the app crashes almost constantly. He likes to play the games and clean his fish tank but he gets really frustrated and gives up because it lags and closes all the time. I can't say I blame him!! It would be great IF it worked!",
"Very hard to cancel. The website is a horrible buggy mess. Does not support mobile. Does not support desktop mode well. Forgets the password every once in a while (I use a password app so there is no way it's wrong). Very unethical that you make it super difficult to get to the settings and cancel the subscription. UPDATE: Yes, cancelling on a desktop works. Please fix your website so that it can be done on a phone.",
Would be much better if I could manage the subscription through my phone rather than inputting credit card information. It would make it easier to cancel and/or manage with the option to manage the subscription right from the Google play store like every other app. I'm not even going to bother with the free month since this charge option isn't available.,
"I would give the app a 5 star however when I signed up there was a really good discount but I didn't hit the correct sign up button and was charged the full price instead of the 45 percent discount. Then when I go in to login it takes a really long time to load and login. Not thinking I will renew once the full year is done. Not 100 percent satisfied. 3-24-2020 The app is working so much better now, you are able to login quickly and there is no more issues with the loading part of the app.",
Is sooo slow to load on any device as well as glitchy. I have to close the whole thing and open it back up multiple times in a short period of time because nothing is loading and my son gets frustrated and chooses to play something else. When it works smoothly he enjoys it but that is VERY rare. Has been a waste of money and I'm just waiting for my subscription to be up to cancel.,
The learning path has been stuck in the same activity for the past 3 days we played it repeatedly and it seems to be stuck it does not stop. When you try to press anything else on that screen it does nothing and you have to close the program and go back in. It is disappointing because you are paying for something that cannot be used properly.,
"After all the hype I expected better. Don't get it, the app is garbage Please check the Better Business Bureau before anything. Wish I had. First the app kept freezing and kicking my daughters out. When they were able to get on they found it boring and quickly lost interest. Also, I signed up for the free month trial, which I ended canceling after 3 only days. Checked my account to find I was charged during this time. There is no phone number listed on the website, only a email address. I on",
"Doesn't work on Samsung tablet. Thought this was a great app until it stopped working on my fairly new tablet. Optimized storage, cleaned my cache and it still stopped working. It was fine for two days, then started stalling and eventually just froze on a blank screen. So bummed. My 4 yr old was having a ton of fun. I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if it would work.",
"The app is broken, it is always very slow and unresponsive on our Ipads and Kindles, on my Galaxy it just plays talkback and the touch screen is completely unresponsive. This is very frustrating for my 4yr old daughter as she prepares to start school in the fall. I am probably going to cancel our subscription if the software is not fixed.",
"I have a touchscreen laptop. The very first exercise was trace the letter A. Guess what doesn't work properly? Touching the screen. Had to use a mouse, my child doesn't have experience with a mouse so tracing is completely foreign and useless. The next activity was word puzzle. Drag and drop words. Guess what doesn't work... The touch screen input. The activities which do not require dragging work. While I was writing this, the game froze. Why is this required to be online? Dissatisfied",
"The app is ok, though the user interface is definitely not user friendly. So many things to navigate to and difficult to tell what is what. The app is also pretty slow to load each screen/option regardless whether on wifi or not(tried different devices as well). The App could definitely improve for a better end user experience.",
"This app use to work on my samsung phone and my son loved it! Bought a year subscription, but for some reason is not working anymore. It showed that it was loading but would never load and when I reinstalled it, it shows a black screen. So of you have a samsung, do not buy or install this app. It won't work!",
Once you activate your membership you can never access the account. There's a glitch everytime you log in and it freezes up EVERYTHING!! I had to uninstall and reinstall still didn't work and had to restart phone multiple time because it freeze up my phone. Never was able to login to start learning!! Don't waste your time or money.,
"It's all great until you try to cancel the services. I have used and paid for a yearly subscription since 2016. I canceled last year (or so I thought) , until this morning I see a damn yearly subscription taken out of my account. I go in to cancel again, and I'm forced to download the app to my phone. I tried to downlad the app just for it to say it's already installed, but for some reason it isn't in my phone anywhere. So I go to my desketop...to no avail. I can't seem to get rid of this service. So the next stop will be legal. I'm tired of the run arounds and bs, just to cancel services I no longer need. Don't get me wrong the services are nice when you need them, but after that it SHOULD NOT BE THIS HARD TO CANCEL SERVICES PERIOD!",
"Trash. It's all coloring and the same videos. My kid spends all her time window shopping or in the room rearranging things and doesn't want to play the ""curriculum"". To get an assessment to choose right ""curriculum"" is an additional 100 on top of what ever monthly or annual fee you choose. Also kills the battery and overheats devices.",
It was a great app at first and my son loved it. But then the payments weren't going through for some reason. And now it won't even let me log in. It keeps sending me back to the yellow sign in page even after uninstalling and reinstalling it. Not worth the stress.,
"I'm so disappointed with whatever update they did to this app. It no longer works. We've have spent hours, multiple days, for weeks trying to remedy the situation. When you open it, it does one of three things 1.) Blank screen that never goes anywhere 2.) Tells me there's no internet (but all other apps work on Internet fine) 3.) Takes about 20 minutes to load, only for nothing to work in the game. I've done every update possible, force stop and reopen, deleted and reinstalled the app, still bad",
"Just started today and not pleased, I've signed up , set up my password and it has been stuck on one page for 30 minutes, I rebooted the tablet, still stuck on the same blank screen with alphabets in the back, tried it on the desk top and phone and on the desktop its stuck on the log in page, I was really excited about this, now I'm very disappointed, I still would love to use the app if these kinks get worked out!",
It has some cool features but definitely not worth the price tag and you a card even for the trial. Even though I canceled through my Google account they kept charging my card on their own. To cancel it you have to do it right in the ap apparently. My fault for not noticing for a year but wasn't very happy with their offered solutions either. There are better but more affordable and free games. I wouldn't go this route.,
"My daughter is a year and a half, and my friends daughter is two. One thing that we both have an issue with that other applications (including free ones) have is they lock the app so you can give the device to the child and they can interact with it. This application doesn't lock, and is so frustrating I have almost uninstalled multiple times because my daughter accidentally goes out of the game, and the application. Please fix this or I will uninstall.",
WORST APP EVER!!!! I just downloaded the app also downloaded it on several other devices. The app either doesnt load at all or it crashes. I paid for a year subscription and have spent the past 3 hours just trying to access the site to do one activity for my 5 yo daughter. I tried contacting costumer service but no one is available. I need a refund asap. DO NOT PURCHASE the subscription. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.,
Really annoying. Some programs say error. A lot of the math u click and it automatically puts the answer. How is that helping? Then other games ask a question so quickly over and over doesnt give u a chance to figure it out. So many things i dont like about this program. Ill give it a few more days or im canceling my free trial. Please fix these errors. Dont allow a student to click on the side bar and then it auto fills. They have to find the right spot themselves,
When I first paid for the subscription it was great! My son would play and learn for healthy periods of time and enjoyed it! Unfortunately I have had to contact customer support many times because the app does not work. He hasn't been able to play since before June! Customer support acts like they have no clue what the issue is and even offered an extra 6 months free but what good is that when we still 6 months later can't even open the app? Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling nothing works,
"I went to cancel my membership on the app, and it asked if I wanted the special offer of $30 for a year instead of canceling. I went to try and move forward with the offer. It asked me for my password, then when you hit enter, nothing happens the app stop working. I tried this atleast 7 times. I restarted the app also and tried again. Wouldn't work. So only option was to decline offer and cancel membership. If someone wants to contact me about the offer, I will take them up on it but thats it.",
"I love this app, my daughter really enjoys this. I'm having one problem though. When I open the app it looks like everything is going to work but a few seconds after opening it the whole screen goes blank. It doesn't go away, I've waited 5mins to see if it would go away but it never did. I've tried many times even deleting it and re-download it. I'm not sure what else to do, could really use some help.",
"Uninstalled immediately because free trial requires credit card at sign up. Obviously they are just hoping you'll forget to cancel so they can get at least one months fee out of you. If you offer a free trial, don't force payment details up front. Most stuff like this gets used for a week or so then forgotten about, let me actually try it before trying to get my money. If you really have a good product I'll sign up for it, but now I'll never know.",
"Not sure what is going on with it, but it locks up my tablet and will lock up my wife's brand new Android. It runs fine for awhile and then you will select an activity and it just runs, never connecting to the selected activity. I have to uninstall and reinstall from the App store to get it too clear. Not impressed at all.",
Son love's this on the computer. I put it on his phone (my old phone) and when i signed in to my account it didn't have any info for him. It kept resetting everytime i changed something like his name it would reset to I'm guessing default cause i don't know Sally. It won't let me put it on his grade level. So either I'm doing something wrong or something is wrong with the app. Will rate again if i get help or figure out what is going on with it.,
Waste of money. Paid a full years subscription and app is unusable. Its always buffering and loading. Other apps run without issues. But this one won't run!!!! Frustrating,
"The app is extremely slow on everything that I download it on. I downloaded this app last year and it was so slow that I deleted it a CD canceled my subscription. I thought that since kids are out of school due to Covid-19, I would try again. Still slow as before... I don't mind paying for the app but it would be better if it was faster. The long loading times and constant freezing is frustrating. If I'm going to pay for something I'd prefer it to work properly.",
"Normally, I shy away before advertised programs but I am glad I tried it. He is learning so much and enjoys it. He is going on three and starting to try to read. It takes your child through steps while giving them the ability to advance or take their time. i enjoy it myself at times.",
Would give zero stars if I could. App hasn't worked for months. The log in page always freezes and says something about disable talk back during play. Talk back has never been enabled on my phone.. works fine on husband's phone ( same model) I have to force close the app each time. It's hit or miss whether or not it works on my computer too. Fixing to just cancel,
I absolutely love ABC mouse but the app is soooo slow I have to close it out and restart it a ton just to get onto something my daughter wants to do. We don't have a computer and it's really frustrating to me and especially my 4 year old when the app isn't working properly. Definitely needs some major improvement on that please! With no school or libraries until probably may with all this covid-19 mess this is the best option for learning at home right now. Please please fix!,
"The app is amazing academically speaking, but I hate the fact we are paying for it and it freezes, wont load, stops working, and does not respond. We have the app on multiple systems, and it faults on all of them. Wonderful app that we all love to have and use. They just need to fix the bugs first.",
"Barely works, if at all... Not worth the money... More detail: The app frequently has connection issues. When it does work it's laggy and slow, even over 100mbps internet that is reliable for multiple streaming services etc. I spend more time trying to get this to work than my kid does using it. I'll improve the star rating if the company can provide a software/service that works. Until then, I can't recommend anyone else waste money on this service.",
"Started out awesome for the money. Then the app started failing, or not loading at all. Finally we have up on it completely. Around six months into it, we no longer remembered our log in information and could NOT reach anyone to cancel it. It's been a year and I FINALLY had to dispute the charges and have my bank block all future charges. Not worth the hassle, or the lost money.",
"It does not load. Very slow on multiple devices. Love the app itself when it does load, my child enjoys playing the games and I enjoy the learning that is happening, but it rarely works.",
"The app says you get one month free but I got billed for the whole year even though I cancelled the subscription not 2 days after downloading the app. Also, it says its available in spanish but when you change the language the content its still in english: the audio, the songs, the voice. The app itself has way too many things together which was very confusing for my 3 year old, specially since it was in a completely different language.",
Excellent my son loves it and has learned so much. The assessments also let me know where I should shift focus if required.,
Too many glitches.. Takes 20 years to load videos. Usually have to sign out and back in. Very big hassle,
This app never works for me. I need someone to get this thing working asap.,
The app is TERRIBLE. It takes so long to load (took a whole minute to start up and it's not a problem ob my end). It freezes all the time and since everything is so slow I never know it's frozen or still learning. Ready to get my money back because it's often unusable.,
"Just downloaded it but i can see where it would be an amazing learning tool for my little one. Registered on the PC, had some issues on my phone during the download so we used continued to used the online version and it worked just fine.Began to search for an online app that would at least allow for the videos; no luck there either.Will try later on tablet, hoping for better successes! Glad the trial is for two months, seeing some glitches... Promos at signup should be offered during retention",
"My 2 year old daughter is in the preschool room and loves the puzzles and games but I have to navigate everything on the app for her, the app isn't user friendly to 2-4yr olds theres way too many things to push and the buttons are tiny, its just too hard. theres better educational apps that are more user friendly for her age group, so I'm unsatisfied and unsubscribing.",
"It's very educational and fun for the kids. The only problem I have with it is that if a child is struggling in a lesson, there is no supporting lessons to help them to go back to. Ie, if your child fails subtraction, there is no indicator saying ""please review this lesson (explaining what subtraction is or howto do it) again to help."" Therefore, the child gets frustrated. Specifically, ""Squawk Block: Addition and Subtraction"" is a BIG jump from previous lessons, and it had a timer, for anxiety.",
I'm trying to learn my ABC but the password won't work. It's a great app for learning. And I've learned everything I could. Now I would like to cancel it. My name is Michael Elias Hernandez.,
I love the concept of the app. The only thing I would change is tickets for cheating. My son wants to earn a bunch of tickets so that he can buy things. I love this idea because it is motivates him. BUT he can skip through a whole lesson without getting anything right and he still receives tickets. I would really like this to change so that I dont have to constantly supervise him while on the app,
"I would have given it a better score had they cancelled my subscription when I told them to, instead I was charged another year for it. My daughter did not have any interest in it. It really was not set up like I thought. She did not like the songs and had to go thru them all before she could move on. She was more advanced than her learning path. The fact the I have been charged for two years of it instead of their customer service people cancelling like I requested is why I am giving one star.",
Suck a great tool for Education and entertainment for my Child. I'm a world where you literally cannot trust teachers this is invaluable!,
Crashes when opening the app.,
App no longer loads... please fix,
App keeps crashing. Galaxy s21,
"The app is good for interactive learning but the money invested was for the daily classroom videos, which have been missing for over a month now. Initially they offered the 'Best Of' series, but now that's gone. While the learning path is ok, there are numerous other applications and real life games that do the same. The payment was because of the live videos daily. The rectification from support was to add a free month onto my account, which great, but doesn't fix the concern.",
"This app used to be great, but it's been glitchy and slow for months and the last couple weeks I can't even get it to open. What am I paying for!? I've been a member for three years and I'd like to cancel but I paid for the year back in December. Can I get my money back? Very annoying!",
App isn't loading on my phone I've only ever got it to come up and be played 1 time. It's also a little complicated for my kid right now,
"Honestly, one star is generous, as we havent been able to use it AT ALL. I set up an account on the desktop and it lagged horribly. I had to keep refreshing it. Nothing is loading. I downloaded it on my phone and had the same issues. It wouldn't connect to the internet, it wouldnt load at all, and the screen kept going black. I deleted it and it wont even let me re-download. It ""loads"" 100% then the install button reappears. Super disappointing. We will be moving on to a different learning app.",
"Terrible experience, keeps freezing when my son is in the ""learning path"" so he cant move on from the letter B. We yave contacted cutomer service and they are too bust to resolve the this due or get back to us . i will ge calling and cancelling this afternoon. I am an educator and was trying this out s second time to see if it is something useful, if it desnt work then whats the point BTW. we rebooted, reinstalled the app, changed computers and devices, etc Extremely frustratinng !",
"I love the program, but since the last update the app freezes. The music still plays but my son can't play or do any activities until I close the app completely and then open it again. He has learned so much using ABCmouse, but this freezing all of a sudden is inconvenient and frustrating.",
"CONTENT & CURRICULUM ARE PERFECT, if ABCMOUSE would just attempt 2 make it usable, they would double the amount of subscribers they have. ONLY thing to not like is that every single click LITERALLY takes 3 min, OR FREEZE UP. This is true for more than one child's account (twins) and on more than one device. The speed the program runs at is reminiscent of ""GETTING ONLINE"" when the net was brand new, Using Dial-Up attempting 2 connect 2 AOL in the begining bfor a half hour. 1990s tech!",
"This app could be great if it wasn't so awful. It runs SLOW. REALLY SLOW. It doesn't work at all because of how slow it is on my kids' Amazon tablets. It won't even load on my note currently. After 5 minutes it will finally get to the background and then nothing. I can hit the back button on my phone and it will ask if I want to log out, but nothing else will load. We've had this app for almost 2 years and it has been glitchy and problematic the whole time.",
This app would be amazing if it didn't lag/not load pages. My son loves it when it does work but he gets tired of having to get out and get back into the program many many times. He eventually gives up and plays something else. Defeats the purpose! Please fix whatever this is!,
Useless since it takes forever to load or start a new lesson...my 3 and 5 year want to use it but get frustrated with how long it takes n don't use it at all any more. I even got new tablets just so they can use it but both have been a waste of money for us. Seems like a great app if it worked better. All other apps work just fine. We have great wifi at home because my husband works from home. I paid for a whole year never again. I don't understand how this app has such a high rating.,
"This particular ABC mouse classroom app never loads anymore. I did not have issues with it for the first 18 months I had it. Every other ABC mouse app (zoo, math, language arts, alphabet) works perfectly fine except this one. All it does is load and flip the screen back and fourth. Please fix the bugs so my child can continue learning.",
Great App...when it is working. It would be better on a computer or on a tablet. Something that is more compatible with it. When it is working it is very helpful for my kids. It started up just fine yesterday but kept freezing so needed to be restarted. Today I can't even open it and have even been waiting a couple of minutes to see if it would. Would not suggest for a phone.,
"I can't get anything to load. I've deleted the app, re downloaded and checked my internet connection and still, we go to the learning path, click on something and it's just a blank screen and says 0:00, play button is there but its not clickable. No amount of trouble shooting is working.",
"It's okay, the learning path games are on the basic repetitive side. There's no variation my daughter actually got frustrated with a game because she wanted a variety in it but it only had her pick out the letter B. I liked one of the tracing ones but it was only tracing the letter A once and then nothing else. She's having fun for the most part but at the same time I wish there was more content for pre K.",
"It was great at first until the last couple months. It's been almost a month since I have reached out to support about not being able to access my account after the autopay took its portion. I am still not able to log in and another payment is about to be auto withdrawn soon. I would rather a response than cancelling the card. Had this issue been resolved practically I would have gave a five star review and recommend to others. But, I'd rather call police because I feel robbed.",
"WARNING! ABCMouse may not honor subscription cancellation and billing. My daughter loved this app when she was just starting to learn to read. She got past the main usefulness of the app, so I cancelled the subscription. Over a year later, I discovered that the cancellation was not effective, and many months of billing had continued. I contacted ABCMouse about this to again cancel, and to request a refund of those months of inappropriately billing. Not surprised that they ignored the request for refund, but they apparently ignored the 2nd cancellation, and continued to bill monthly. This was many months ago, if not years.",
"I don't know why I'm spending money on an app that is constantly freezing up on me. It is very frustrating. If it didn't freeze up all the time I would give it 5 Stars definitely. Got a free code from my daughter's school while it is closed. The app won't even open. I was hoping it had improved since I last used it, nope.",
I've tried to download this app many times on many devices but it doesn't download. I sent an email to inform ABC Mouse I wanted to cancel my subscription/end free trial. They sent an email back saying to cancel I need to download the app. I haven't been able to check out the content since the app is wonky.,
"Hi, I'm having a hard time using your app even on your website. It's not logging in even tho I put the email and password correctly. I also tried logging and using the app but it says ""you're offline"" even tho my computer and phone is connected to the internet. It's frustrating for us teachers and students who use your app. Hope this would reach out to you and fix the issue. Thanks!",
"This is malware. When you start the app it offer 30 days free. If you click this link the app opens a video and takes over your phone. You cannot exit out of the video, it freezes your controlls. I literally had to restart the phone in order to stop the video and delete the app.",
"this is the best app to help young children learn while having fun. It has a variety of books to read from, games to play while learning, coloring pages, songs and videos of different school subjects. You can also read some books in Spanish, and it has a small piano with 4 different songs that kids can learn to play. Best educational app and worth every penny.",
This app is so infuriating. It rarely loads and I'm just stuck sitting at a blank gold screen until I try to close and then the mouse will pop up asking if I'm sure I want to exit.. my son is frustrated and hates going to the app because of this. I had it once before and had issues but when it does work (like slim to none) my son does like it but the majority of our experience is having to deal with either the annoying sign up page to try and get logged on OR it just loading to a blank screen.,
"somehow the app was deleted from my computer, then trying to reinstall it took forever, and my kid doesnt even find this challenging, she gets frustrated with how slow it is. Trying to navigate around it is ridiculous. I will not sign up for this again. My kid doesnt find this challenging at all. I'm not sure why ABC Mouse is so awesome, because it's kind oif a bust.",
This app is not the greatest. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and my software is all up to date but for some reason there are a lot of activities where for whatever reason it's not registering touch which has caused my 4 year old to become beyond frustrated to the point he broke my s pen on my screen trying to get it to work and thankfully didn't crack the screen in doing that. I'm am 110% certain it's the app because I do not have a problem with my phone registering touch in any other app,
I love it for my 4 year old but it definitely needs to step it up with more game options .It definitely moves them way to fast onto the next letter or number without them really getting to grasp it. Repetition is key hence why they need more game options for each letter or number. It is the same games over and over and my son is getting bored.,
"This app repeatedly puts itself in landscape mode oriented like its in portrait mode, so that only half the screen is visible. This happens randomly and frequently. When it does so, it ceases to be interactive and needs to be restarted.",
"Learning Path is not working. This app was working great until this happened. With school's closed, we really depended on this app to supplement learning. I know there are others we can use, but I liked this one. I sent an email to ABC mouse and they replied saying they are swamped and will get back to me when they can. So much for that free month üò≠",
"Slow and glitchy. I have been waiting 10 min for it to log in now, usually when my kid plays it it freezes or lags way down. They get upset and want me to fix it but I cant. Does it on the computer too. They love the site with all its games and books and everything to learn but I wish it would just work right",
We love ABC mouse! But it stopped working on my Android phone. It's talking as if we changed the setting and it will not let me click on anything. It's telling me to turn off talk to text and to please resume talk back while on web view. What does that mean? I don't have talk to text. I have restarted my phone and uninstalled it multiple times. I also chatted with 3 representatives from ABC mouse and no one could help me fix the problem on my android phone. Is this happening to anyone else?,
"Super buggy. I expected more for something I'm paying for; I have better luck with free apps. I tried to set time limits for both my kids; it worked fine for one but freezes up and I have to close out of it every time I try to set a limit for my other kiddo. Now, when the time is up and I try to switch to my other kiddo it makes me put my password in, but the number keyboard doesn't work. I can't enter my password correctly so I'm literally locked out. Had it 3 days and ready to cancel.",
After buying the two months for five dollars on my computer I downloaded the app for my 4 year old and it won't load at all. I logged him into the site through my laptop and it keeps freezing and lagging to the point that I've had to restart my computer multiple times. I'd like to think that this is caused by the influx of people getting on due to being stuck home but googling shows years of people saying their experience was similar.,
"Terrible. absolutely terrible. I was watching my child play ABC mouse, as he always does in the morming. He answered a question but the same question came up again. He solved it again but it came up AGAIN. Then the online teacher came on the screen. He was saying gibberish and glitching out. I keep reloading the app but it just turns to a black screen, then fades to red. I spent my hard-earned money on this, and the app is 100% not worth it. I had high hope for it at first but it's been ruined.",
I know that ABC Mouse is an amazing program but the app is horrible. Nothing lines up so when you try to pop the balloons you have to click far left. My 3 year old can't even get past the first stage in the learning center. She is getting fraustrated that she can't get it to pop. I am sure she will give up on it soon. So sad.,
"Reading other reviews, I understand others are having the same problem. I understand it is because this app is probably having a lot more kids on them at this time but it should be able to handle the problems. My children cannot even get through a game without it pausing or can't select another option with their pets... Honestly after the free trial I do not know if I will continue.",
App keeps getting stuck at loading page. Customer support fixed it once after 2 days but it happened again and now they wont fix it. Really disappointed as my 2yr old really liked playing on it. I'm even more upset that support has been so slow and unhelpful. I always heard good things of the app and all. Guess its onky good if you dont run into issues since support wont help after the 1st problem.,
"I really like this app for my 3 year old and she loves it BUT it updates SOO frequently and the app won't work at all if we don't update everytime. My child's tablet can not keep up and it's a newer tablet. We are constantly deleting things and uninstalling apps just to make space to run abc mouse, its frustrating. If my daughter didn't love it so much I would have stopped using it lol. Its nice that they fix & add things I just wish we could run it without updating every few days/ every week.",
"Soooo slooooww! This could be the slowest app we've ever used, and I'm not using hyperbole. Also the environment is very chaotic and difficult to use. It seems designed with adults in mind instead of kids. We had a subscription but had to cancel it. Khan Academy Kids is much better and is obviously designed for kids not parents.",
"The learning aspects were good, the customer service is awful. I got a free two month trial which I logged into and cancelled the same day as I signed up to ensure I wouldn't forget to cancel and be charged again. It was a simple process to cancel, much easier than most subscription services. Imagine my surprise when I saw a charge on my credit card for it. Then customer service told me I'm lying about having cancelled it. This is an unscrupulous company.",
"I've downloaded and subscribed to this twice now. About 10 years ago when my son was younger, when I found that it most of the time wouldnt load or froze, or he got frustrated due to not being able to navigate through it. And now I thought over time they mustchave resolved these issues I got it for six months for my 5 & 2 year olds... Still same old ABCMouse. Total bummer. When it works they enjoy it though.",
I wanted an app that would encourage reading. My son just kept going to the area to wash and feed his cat. (We have cats) He didn't like the songs or reading material. I tried to get him to go to the library and math section. He was disinterested. He said the music was too babyish?? Okay... he was in his level; 1st grade. I tried a different app that was free and he's picked up on reading. Unfortunately this app just wasn't a fit for my 6 y/o,
This app is laggy and it freezes a ton. My daughter is no longer able to go further on the app because it won't go pass this one lesson. She's only been using it for 2 days. Anyone know how to get a refund? Update 4/16/20 Uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't work and there are no updates pending for this app in the play store. The developer is asking everyone to uninstall and reinstall but that won't fix the issue. Stalling seems to be a common problem.,
"The response to my issue is the app constantly freezing was to uninstall and then reinstall. If you read my review, then you would know that the issue occurs with the same account on MULTIPLE devices. The issue is not with the MULTIPLE devices--phones, laptop, and tablet. It is with the app. I'm not uninstalling on all devices and reinstalling. Fix the app. I've read the reviews. MANY people are having terrible issues.",
"Great learning content, but the app is trash! I've tried to get this app to work properly and consistently on both a laptop and a tablet several times on several different days, but it only works on a cell phone. It's so disappointing to a young child. Also, you can't delete user profiles without adding one in.",
"I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Per communication with tech support, my device supports and meets the minimum requirements for the application. The application runs slowly, lags often. My toddler cannot get the full experience this app is supposed to offer. I find it to be of poor customer service to tell me that my device meets the minimum requirements and at the same time tell me that meeting the minimum requirements is not enough for the application to work properly. This is what I paid for?",
"In response to your message - no you cannot just ""cancel your membership at anytime"". You have to download an app. I do not have any space big enough on any of my devices to download your app. Everytime I try to access your website whether it is through a mobile or tablet, it tells me download the app üò° apparently without the app, I cannot cancel my subscription.",
I have made two payments and still haven't used it yet.. the screen flips and turns on all devices and computers. So frustrated. Unable to subscribe. WORTHLESS. I WILL JUST STICK WITH IXL!!! I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MY MONEY BACK FOR NOT BEING A LE TO USE THIS SITE. It worked two years ago and the older kids loved it. But I deleted it afterwards WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT NOW!!!,
"Been using the app for about 4 days now with my kids. Didn't think it was enough time to talk about it but its enough time to talk about it. I personally think that the game has to much to offer and is more so for a child and parent app and not just ""okay, I trust that my child can learn this on their own."" The app has to many distraction and to much at one time. I almost had an anxiety attack. My kids are entertained but they are distracted by everything else on the app. ALSO KEEPS FREEZING!",
"The app constantly freezes, and unexpectedly shuts down across all devices. Is overall an headache to deal with. Kids love it when it works, but it mostly doesn't work right now. I would not purchase the service right now, they don't currently have the bandwidth to handle the influx of new customers. Looking to get a refund.",
"I love this app. Sadly my daughter no longer uses it. I have tried for months to CANCEL my subscription, but customer service sucks and they have billed me anyway. The history on the app CLEARLY shows that we have NOT used the app in quite sometime. Repeated calls and emails have been left unanswered, but billing continues to deduct the monthly payment. As it seems, ABC Mouse ONLY cares about the MONEY aspect and not customer satisfaction.",
"I'm enjoying exploring the different activities with my grandson, however there are a few items that don't respond or work properly. Example~when exploring the globe, the map continues to load and won't respond. We have to exit out of the app and go back in. Other then a few glitches, a very good program for childhood development and learningüòä",
This app is complete trash!! I have it downloaded on 3 devices and it doesn't work on all 3. I try to access the settings so that I can cancel and can't. I try and cancel through my computer and can't. The whole process of it is a complete joke. ABC mouse is nothing like it used to be years ago. If I could give it negative stars and leave a review still I would.,
"HORRIBLE!!! Laggy, buggy, and virtually unusable. It constantly asks me to log in, it constantly claims I'm offline when in fact I'm not, it freezes, lags, and I repeatedly have to close and reopen this stupid app, which makes my kindergartner frustrated as well. FIX or we'll resume using the iPad app! I'd give -5 stars if I could!",
"Overall its very educational, creative, helpful. But i think its more for ages 3 and up. Some of the things expected for my 2 years old son, i feel like its way to afbance for him and tends to get overwhelmed quickly. . What he does like to do on the app or should i say what he can do on the app is helpful and insightful ful. Sometimes i get on there for myself and i am grown and i get challenged on big kids criteria myself.",
They keep charging you monthly after they lure you to annual payment. Ridiculous ! My account has been charged monthly after I did the annual subscription. This is ridiculous. The transaction doesnt show on the app but it shows on my credit card.  I paid for annual subscription on April 23 2020.. but has been charged twice on 4/28 and 5/28.,
"This app didnt work 3 years ago and it still doesnt work today after I installed and tried it again. I wish I could upload the screenshot I took of the tiny half screen that comes up on our crombook instead of the entire picture of this app. Years ago when we tried it, the app was constantly crashing and freezing. I would have thought that they would have fixed all their issues by now. Not sure why teachers recommend this so much, maybe its just another sign of our crumbling education system.",
Not compatible with Tab E. We have the newest Samsung galaxy Tab E and this app only worked a week. When it did work it was great. It works on our galaxy 9 phones so far. But what kind of learning experience will they have on a 5 inch screen? This app and half the offline apps provided with ABCMouse say they are not compatible with this $300 tablet. When it did work it would load slowly.,
I paid for a one year subscription and then download the app. The app freezes at the log in screen. It does not let you type into the email or password field. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. Please fix this issue!,
"We used for about a year and my child did really enjoy the program...but the app was always horrible!! I feel like we spent more time trying to get the app to work than actually using it. When you have a child trying to work independently and a parent needing a break, this is very frustrating for the parent to hear ""ABC Mouse is not working again"" - especially for a PAID program that is not cheap. Updates never helped. We pretty much just stopped using and did not renew.",
"My son loves this app and it has really taught him a lot. He doesn't like structured lesson time yet but has learned a lot on his own through exploring the app. It can get buggy/glitchy at times, probably because its getting more popular. I just uninstall and reinstall when that happens which can be annoying. But I deal with that with other apps anyways. Thank you",
This is an excellent supplement for homeschooling and my kids love the learning games and reading sections.,
"I really want to give this more stars but just can't do it. I've had this for several years and my child loved it at first but since there are so many lessons, some of which repeat, she became bored of it over time. She quickly progressed past the pace of the app so it's pretty useless. I've been playing for her to get ABC mouse caught up to where she is. Hopefully in the next month or so we will be there and see it it's worth keeping. Wish I had more room to provide more feedback...",
We have been using this app for about 6 months and my 2 year old loves it! He begs me to play mouse all the time. Obviously we have limits to how much screen time he has but it makes me so happy to see him excited to learn new things. There have been several times when he will complete an activity on the learning path and run to show me what he has done! I've seen him blossom so much in such a short period of time and could not express how much ABC mouse has helped him developmentally!,
"Was excited to finally download & buy the app for my 2 and 4 year old. It took me 2 days to create an avatar. Once I had somewhat of 1 avatar, the profile pic of it was a head and the rest looked like a freeze frame from an old VHS movie when you rewind it. It was very slow and I tried it on my android phone, samsung tablet and chromebook laptop. I got the feeling that people sign up, pay and then uninstall it and that's how this program makes money. Very shocked at the slow operation of this.",
"Was working fine just 2 days back. But now, it has become too glitchy and unusable. When the app starts audible warning messages are read out in super speed and then the app just stops responding. Tried on my tabs and on phone, also uninstalled and reinstalled but still no use. After paying a hefty price for an annual subscription just 1 week back, really let down by the quality.",
I would like to change my previous review. It seems work smoothly. My 2 year old son is learning a lot from it. He knows the alphabet and numbers. We are happy for the result. We may consider for annual subscription if we can get discount deal. Thanks! --------‚Äê‚Äê----‚Äê---------------------------------------- I crashed very often. My 2 year son was crying a lot for this situation. I wish I could pay monthly so I could cancel the subscription anytime. I made mistake to pay them annually.,
"We have not been able to log in for a few weeks already. We have updated to the app. Uninstalled, reinstalled and nothing. I click TV o enter email and password and it won't let me enter my info in none of my electronic. I am beyond frustrated I payed for a year and have not been able to use it. Ived had it before for my oldest child and it worked wonders years ago. Please advise. I have already emailed about this and have yet to receive a response.",
"I dowloaded it and subscribed for 6months. It didn't work after I paid, I can't really click anything. It's stuck at the log in page. It said I can easily unsubscribe but I have to contact customer service because the cancellation button on their site doesn't work. Not yet sure if there will be problems with refund and unsubscribing. Will see...",
"Paid for a one year subscription with assessment included and my girls go to play on their learning path and it sometimes freezes up so they can't progress. I have emailed customer service with no reply. Super frustrated. If these bugs and freezes didn't take place, the app would be absolutely fantastic. Yes, we have uninstalled app, and re-installed it. We've also rebooted devices and even gone on an actual computer. Freezes still take place. Please fix them soon!",
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Downloaded the app and tried to sign up for the month free trial. This required me to put in my credit card details which I did. It came back with an error message stating my details were incorrect but $1.43 has been charged to my card. Now when I open the app I can't get past the home screen even though they have my credit details. I have emailed them and have had no reply after 2 days and they said all enquiries are responded to within 48 hours. Very disappointing.,
The app itself is great. My kids love to play it. I have my preschooler and my kindergartener is on it. There is where our first problem is. The app glitches and changes their profiles in the middle of playing or it will just get stuck. This results in me having to uninstall it on my phone sometimes multiple times a day. If my kids didn't love it so much I wouldn't fool with it. I pay for it to work and it isnt.,
"Glitches for grandkids, 2 years too many. I asked why they were not playing and was told it glitches up grandma and then I can't get back in. So today we got on and about 30 minutes in he is having fun but it freezes and it has been all day...I have tried multiple times to reboot. IMO paying $80 a year I should not have to uninstall and install so frequently. This has happened on 2 phones and 2 tablets I am tired of the frustration of trying to get the app to work at this cost.",
"Too slow to use, on a top of the line phone. Will continue trial on desktop to see if the user experience is any better, but having multiple device options is certainly ideal, particularly for my youngest who can't easily use the computer.",
"I'm on the fence. It could be an amazing tool for kids and parents! But, the app sucks and the user interface needs work. The toggle to allow your kids to spend tickets or not doesn't work. Deletion of profiles doesn't work. The layout doesn't have lessons available on main screen, you have to go into another screen for that which is not effective for toddlers. Expected more from them, hopefully their website and usage on a laptop is easier.",
"This app is a SCAM! They say you can ""cancel anytime"" but they hide their customer support number. Also if you sign up through Google or Apple (as most of us do) they tell you that you can't cancel through them OR receive a refund. My subscription didn't even show up on my Google account and I had to go through hoops to find it and cancel. Still not sure if I'll be charged. I can't speak for the gameplay as my nephew lost intrest in less than 5 minutes.",
"Incapable with certain devices. Poor customer service. My child uses a Kindle Fire to play use this app. However, many of the lessons freezes on the Kindle. I have been able to get around these glitches on another device, but this lasted only for so long until my phone couldn't open the lesson. I've used several methods to getting customer services attention, only to be sidelined. I'm hoping this review will get their attention to address the issue. Maybe provide further troubleshooting help.",
Absolutely useless. No stars if it was possible. The app wouldn't even allow us to log into anything ever. It was a waste of money and a waste of time to attempt. And trying to communicate with the chat help was nothing but a robot response unit and waiting to hear back in email to resolve the issue was a waste because they just suggest trying again and contacting them... What's the point.,
I signed up for the free subscription during the pandemic. Our 4-year-old loved it! Once the free subscription was over I received an email stating they were going to continue it being free due to the pandemic. I checked my bank account and they have been charging me since May! I feel this is deceitful! When I called to complain they only offered to refund the last month and discontinue the subscription. We were expecting a free subscription but instead we were charged unknowingly! I feel scamme,
"its a pretty heavy file, I haven't even been able to use it yet as it won't allow ,e to pay. you have to pay before anything. there's a ""free trial"", but you must enter your billing information first which it won't allow through PayPal. it takes me to the regular login PPal screen, but once pyre in it just plain logs you in. doesn't show the usual payment confirmation screens and doesn't redirect. I have a limited amount of data per month in WiFi and I just wasted it on a glorified +90 MB PayPalb",
"I have 3 children. All boys and all have ADHD so it is hard for them to focus on things for too long, which does impact their learning. This app makes it fun and enjoyable to learn for them! For roughly $10/month I can drastically increase my childrens' knowledge and not have to squeeze in individual learning time with each of them separately every night in an already busy schedule. This allows us all to sit down and when one of them get stuck on their own age level lesson, it's easy to jump in!",
"I purchased ABC mouse in Hopes to find something fun and educational for my 2 year olds. The application is kinda difficult for them to maneuver to one game, lesson to the next. The 2 year old settings are not designed for all children level of development in mind. Most of the games an learning tools are old and short and dont hold their attention long.",
"Edit: an Android text to speech option was to blame. (This setting did not break any other aps.) If you encounter the problem below, turn off all accessibility options on your phone and the app will work. Support was pretty good at helping me find the solution. ORIGINAL:Unusable on Pixel 2 XL. Can't login. Can't use imbedded keyboard to edit text fields. Works on other devices. For such an expensive subscription, I expect it to be functional on all my devices.",
As with others the learning path wont progress and the puzzles don't load or freeze on blank screen. Reinstalled emailed support but now feedback. The auto responses from the provider recently don't seem to be reading what the reviewer says and repeats the same uninstall reinstall email back lines. Please fix the backend properly as this would be great. Currently in 30 day free trial but wont be subscribing.,
I just downloaded it and created a profile for myself to explore the content. However when I attempt to shut the app down it doesnt allow me to. I have to do a complete shutdown and restart to exit the app. I have a Samsung s9. I've given it 3 stars for mainly that reason.,
"This app has way too much going on the main screen for little kids to Navigate. Needs to be simplified. -Overly repetitive where kids get bored how easy it is. -Helpful if parents could disable vids/only have learning path/ option a child has to finish so many paths before it will ""unlock"" watching videos. Before a child starts, give a placement on where the child should be based on what they already know. After each completed path, have a quiz to determine if a child should move further.",
"DON'T SIGN UP!!! WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!!! I was charged twice in one month before bill was even due and scheduled to be charged a third time for regular billing. I sent a message to customer service about it and the first billing conveniently vanished from the billing history in the app but is still showing on my card! Cancelled my subscription, and am hoping they won't charge me again, though multiple people have had issues with them continuing to charge after cancelling their subscription",
"The content is great. albeit a little repetitive, it keeps my 4 year old interested. The app in itself majorly sucks. Constantly uninstalling, reinstalling, clearing caches, etc. With as much money as they ate collecting from people on a monthly and yearly basis, its ridiculous they can't invest more in their product development. And of course now that i have paid for a yearly subscription, the app wont load.",
"ABCmouse is a great addition to our current lessons that I teach my 3 year old son. We enjoy the variety in music, puzzles, games and stories. My son doesn't want to stop learning most days! The songs they make for learning Abc's my son doesn't like but mom likes them for lessons. The only thing I dont like is the excessive amounts of coloring pages, I understand that it helps children recognize colors but too much isn't needed. I feel that my son has learned more because we utilize this app!!",
"Too much fluff and not enough learning. There is a furniture store (??) Where you can buy things with tickets earned from activities. I get the gaming aspect but the learning is too ""gamefied"" Also, too many coloring activities and jigsaw puzzles on the learning path. It's hard dragging pieces in the right place on a tablet. And you can't even skip these activities. Kid got frustrated and gave up. The numbers practice activity is just a coloring page. The sight words practice is good though.",
My son loves ABC mouse but he got to the 3rd spot on the learning path and there's a book that no matter how long I wait won't load up. I have to close out the app entirely. He's using a brand new tablet. Lots of the games won't load and it's slow. Half the time he can't even play. It freezes randomly. At this rate it seems I wasted my money... Pretty sad about it,
"ABC mouse is so highly recommended, so i paid for it. we will not be paying for it again. App is glitchy across all devices, crashes frequently and causes my device ti be kicked offline frequently. Does not happen on other apps. The learning path is a great idea, but not intuitive and cant be adjusted for learning needs. We started out in first grade and my bright first grader is being introduced to compound words before he has long vowels down. mathematics are similar, jumping all over. ugh",
"30 days free... LIE I subscribed to a first 30 days free link. I entered my card info because I was sure we'd love it. My card was charged for a 1-year subscription within seconds. Turns out, we don't like it at all because none of the videos work. No option in the store to cancel the subscription, like most apps.",
"Loved the app and thought the price was great. Until today. My free trial ends in a week and the app crashed. Can't log in on any format, and when I signed up it said I was getting it on discount $9.95 a month but if you look abc up the monthly rate is $9.95 and is advertising 65% off less than 24 hours after I signed up. I still think the price is great for what I'm getting and my kids love it but I don't like trickery. Hopefully the app and sight are just updating because my kids are excelling",
"Update: I contacted ABC mouse via their website form for customer service, and they refunded my money, but I still don't think it deserves more than 1 star for the app itself, the content, or the fact that I had to deal with this charge to begin with. Original review: ABC mouse charged me for another year without my consent after I specifically cancelled my subscription - cancelled because the content is way too easy for my 5 & 7 year olds, and it doesn't change when adjusting the grade level.",
my four year old loves it! we got this app so that she could do something fun but educational when we are stuck in lines or stuck in the car. we end up doing this app for a little bit almost every day because the games are so engaging and help with so many different aspects of her preschool life. I would definitely recommend it,
Was ok at first then just stopped working. Been paying without fail for 3 mos and have only gotten one month of use from it. Can't update it so I will have to cancel my subscription. Tried for 2 months to get it updated but now I'm over it. Calling customer service to cancel and refund me my money or I will dispute with my bank. This is ridiculous. Not happy at all and DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYONE!!!,
"my son is level 7 and the app keeps stalling, not loading or acknowledging when something is completed. for the past 2 days we have been trying to get past the golden gate bridge tug boat mini game. by the 3rd question it basically crashes. we have tried everything from restarting lesson, reopening app, reinstalling app, optimizing device and even switching to new device we are now on hour 3 of trying to finish the activity w/o restarting/ reopening",
"Great app for learning, but parents beware! Even if you cancel your subscription through the App Store you will still get billed until you cancel it through the app itself. I just had money I couldn't afford to lose taken off my pay card for a subscription I cancelled last month. Very frustrating.",
"Great program, but glitches. We've had multiple instances where the app randomly won't recognize or respond to our touch. Often it won't allow us to switch child users and we have to exit the app and start it up multiple times.",
"It has been trying to download all day, says 70% downloaded for the past 5 hours. Also on PC, it's not user friendly with touch screen, in many places you have to use a mouse and my daughter is only 2 and had difficulty moving around. I'm starting to regret that I paid for a year subscription already. Disappointed.",
"This really isn't meant for your child to learn alone, you have to be active, and if you have a toddler you know they refuse help, they want to do and learn on their own. As an adult this is an amazing concept, to my toddlers, it wasn't, YouTube learning was funner n they enjoy scrolling through n playing and singing on YouTube. ( My kids are 2 and 3) biggest problem with ABC mouse, is scrolling is slow, loading takes forever, my kids lost attention quickly.",
"I wasted an entire year ..as I paid one year fees..but none of my tablets would allow me to even get past the initial sign in page...it automatically turns to a vertical screen and i can only see the bottom half of the screen. i could choose the month and year of birth, girl, and relationship... the entire top half of the screen would not be seen... something needed filled in because if I would press different areas...the type space would appear...but i had no idea what it was asking. frustrated",
App has not been working since my paid subscription has started. The app is stuck on this one activity and my child can't move on from it. I'm so ready to dis continue my subscription. The app is updated and it still does not work. Even tried from my computer and it still doesn't work. Unacceptable,
"The app is SLOW! frustrating to use. The kid starts all happy, but after few activities he gets frustrated with the navigation and slow loading times. Nice concept horribly developed. Too much repetitive content. I though it was the kids tablet but it is also slow in my wifes galaxy s20. So its not the hardware it is just the app that is poorly developed. I will not get the second year subscription.",
"Looking at reviews for the 1st time buyers, I understand the frustration. Ive had this for a few months now. It worked flawlessly until the past few days. I dont blame them, the infrastructure cant handle the sudden surge of us being home from this virus. Ive noticed this with bandwidth as well. This is a very solid app, I stand behind 100% but considering the times now, And with places of employment being low, I dont see this being fixed anytime soon.",
Love the program however I have had to uninstall and reinstall about 4 times now due to issues with freezing up. Works much better on a pc but my son is only 3 yrs and using a mouse isn't as easy as touch screen. Might need to ask for a refund if the app continues to have issues. Using a Samsung Tablet.,
we love this app however lately it takes so long to load. once it finally loads the options chosen (no matter which one) act like it's loading but doesn't. we have downloaded the update and tried it on several platforms and devices but we are experiencing the same issues all the time. ready to cancel subscription.,
"This is a great app and my daughter loves to learn with ABCmouse. That being said, this has to be one of the glichiest apps I've ever used. It's slow and won't load activities at times. We've had to do some activities four or five times because it would freeze up and not complete the lesson. I would give it less than 4 stars, but my kid seriously loves ABCmouse.",
"Problem 1 is you have to do the lessons in order with very little flexibility if your kid doesn't feel like singing songs or poking different colors on the screen just now. There's no ability to skip from one lesson to another, YOU WILL FOLLOW THE LEARNING PATH. Pages take too long to load and often get hung up clocking. At one point we couldn't progress past a particular exercise, no matter what we did. Thanks for the meltdown this caused. Using the latest model Samsung phone and tablets. I have buyers remorse and wish I hadn't spent the money for this.",
whenever i try to sign in it wont let me put the at symbal for an email and everytime it says pls type in a vaild email adress but it wont let me. BE SMARTER NEXT TIME CREATORS ACTULLY FIX UR APP,
"Kids were uninterested and played on and with it infrequently. Bought a year as a present, then got billed automatically for a full second year when I thought our subscription was FINALLY over, no warning, no reminder, just auto debit a year after the fact. No phone number, no chat feature. The ONLY way to reach customer service is to email and hope they get back to you. My hope of getting my money returned and getting out of a full year of an unwanted app are slim.",
"Honestly the worst app!! The app crashes when my child is using it, and there is absolutely no way possible to cancel the membership and it is near impossible to contact customer support. Everytime I click any link to cancel or contact it brings me to a log in screen. Absolutely disgusted! Will be calling my bank ASAP and telling them to block any payments to this company. Scammers. Just Google ABC Mouse and you will see. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!",
I have installed this app on three different devices and it still does not work. The app does not load. On two of the devices I cannot get past the blue screen. On one of the devices I cannot click on any of the activities. I want to cancel the subscription ASAP!!! The commercial and the app are night and day!,
"The games are not bad, but for the high price I expected more, and definitely a better app. The app sometimes requires a long time to load, especially on our fire tablet. It appears a lot of content is loaded online, why does the app not pre load more content? Also, this way one could use the app on trips. Regarding the choice of games in the learning path, my impression is there are few on maths and more or the alphabet. It would be good if parents could control the contents.",
I use to love this for my son when he was younger. Tried it for my daughter recently and the app doesn't work on the phone and some games on the app on the computer aren't working properly. Ima need my money back because this is ridiculous. Work on fixing this program before advertising further.,
"This app is very disappointing. The content is slow to load and has no offline capabilities, so not good for travel or use away from home. The educational content was also underwhelming and not worth the monthly fee. Even when set to two age/grade levels higher than my son's age he wasn't challenged and didn't stay engaged for long.",
"This is an update to a review I wrote on March 15 regarding the issues I was having with this app. I uninstalled it off all my devises and reinstalled it. It is still a little temperamental on tab, takes longer to open and switch between learning activities, but works great on the others. My 4 year old, who could read before this, has really mastered some the reading exercises. I had to put her in the 1st grade level of learning. My 2 year old is good at math and has really benefited from the math games. If you are having issues you may want to uninstall and then reinstall the app. Also, check your security settings, they can delay your app response times.",
This app is all of really good. My only thing that I would improve on is that it gives verbal directions as well as visual directions on what to do. It would also help if all of the puzzles I said what the pieces were. Other than that this app is absolutely amazing! Better than any curriculum I've used given that my day program is closed. As a person who is blind and autistic that uses this one of my favorite things is the daily classes. I like that it's a guided lesson plan where I know that th,
Already have an account and paid the month fees then a few months ago it just stopped working and would freeze. I uninstalled it and then just put it back on now it's asking me to subscribe again and pay more then when I was paying the $10 a month special they had going on when I first signed up. My kid loves it but I for some reason can't log into the account with my email I use...,
"The learning format is great. The way the app responds and glitches is very frustrating. As an early learning tool, it has fabulous content. It also takes forever to load. The screen doesn't respond well or the content will not advance.",
"More times than not, there are problems with not only the app but also what is on my laptop. My granddaughter likes to play shapies. They are gone after kindergarten. Eventhough she is 5, she is in 1st grade, which I do attribute to the help of ABC MOUSE. However, it freezes, goes blank, etc. My daughter in law has paid for everything you can imagine and still there are problems. Children need consistency in not only learning but in life, specially during this pandemic when there lives have",
"We subscribed to ABCmouse for our sons age 4 and just turned 8. Our 8 yr old has a slight learning dissability and has had a very hard time learning to read fluently. We were told ABCmouse would be a fun tool to help him practice his skills without getting so easily frustrated. We homeschool our oldest two children and the 4 yr old tends to feel left out, so we have made ABCmouse his ""homeschool work"". He loves it and is definately learning. Highly reccommend it.",
"Set up new account and tells me email/password is incorrect. Can't cancel ""free"" AUTOMATICALLY renewing trial if I can't even log in because apparently the ONLY way to cancel is through the app that WON'T LET ME LOGIN and no way to contact a human! This app is trash and very deceptive in order to get more money by scamming the consumer. What better way to keep getting money than byaking it IMPOSSIBLE for people to cancel! TRASH!",
I just signed up for ABCmouse and the app keeps crashing. Now I'm thinking I wasted my money.,
"Worst app with even worst billing sysyem.Even after cancelling charged my credit card. I cant even tell which email I used as when I log in my regular email it says that I don't have any subscription. Also, free trail comes with payment and good luck cancelling once you paid as you will get 10 to 15 screens negotiating for lower price. Even after cancelling,I advise you to watch your credit cards for payments posted. My daughter was so facinated by their ads on TV but its actual a crappy app",
"I requested a refund immediately after subscribing because through the whole sign up process the app looked great, full screen, etc.. once we paid and logged in it was unusable. I uninstalled and reinstalled per the advice I saw the company give to others here but it didn't work so I requested a refund. I have been ignored but I see they respond here in reviews. This is my last attempt to contact them before disputing the charge. They were very quick to charge but I've since been ignored.",
"I love abcmouse. My daughter who is 3 has been using it for 3 years just about. She loves it and it has helped her learn a lot of things. I also have been lucky to be able to be hands on and teach her more outside of abcmouse. She loves the new abcmouse tv series search and find, the first 3 episodes and hope there will be more. Also the new @classroom feature is nice as well. We have been going through that lately too. I look forward to more learning for my daughter with abcmouse.",
"Never install on Android!!!(Broken app). It is blocking, because some scripts activating Accessible Assistant on a background, so immediately after putting my card info I wasn't able even cancel it without efforts, screen was blocked(Thanks God I have IT background, so I went to all modern browsers, and tried to logging(guess what, I wasn't successful (Firefox,Edge,Chrome) all of them just spinning for half an hour, no matter what. So the last option for cancelling was IE(old), so that helped",
"This app is great when it works, but it has been very laggy/unresponsive. Some pages take forever to load, others do nothing when you've finished the page. We signed up for the assessments and the first one we tried, listening comprehension, couldn't load the audio. Unfortunately with all the bugs our kids have lost interest",
"This app used to function well, though it was miserably outdated and a lot of the songs/voices were terrible. Now they did an update that added a lot of fresh content but it freezes or doesn't load at all. About to cancel it.",
The Spanish portion of the app is pretty confusing. The texts are in Spanish but the dialogue is in English. It works great for English and the app is engages the kids to learn but if they offer bilingual it needs to be complete to get the most out of our investment.,
"Barely tablet/smartphone supported. Works great on PC, but sadly my child does not know how to use a mouse. We tried using it with his Samsung Tab E 9.6 and parts of the UI are missing. Can't even get into learning path anymore. We tried on my Samsung Note 9 and connection is slow. Went on the PC to compare and it worked great....He used to enjoy abcmouse, but ever since its increasing issues...he doesn't want to do anything with it.",
This app is terrible!!! I downloaded it thinking it would be great for my 2 year old and 7 year old but it is terrible. Not terrible because of the content but because we couldn't use the app....it just buffers and freezes up constantly. Its frustrating for my boys who actually were excited to use it. I'm deleting this app and canceling my subscription. You also have to pay for it too. Why would parents pay for this app that we can't even use.,
"If I could give a lower star I would. I can not sign in at at all into this app and it's ridiculous. I can't even cancel it because it won't allow me to sign in. We've tried from multiple devices, phones, tablets, desktops, and still we get the same response, the loading symbol. I will just have to notify my bank and cancel all payments or get a new debit card. What an inconvenience. DO MOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS SITE",
"This app is absolutely terrible! There are way to many obstacles to manage your account, No legitimate customer service number that you can access, AND it's an absolute nightmare when trying to access your account in order to cancel your membership. I had to continue logging into my account with password nearly a dozen times, Just to be able to make changes to my account. This app is not user friendly in the least!!! I was also double charged to my account. I'm very disappointed in this app!",
Having issues again. When tried to open app says I'm offline. Then tried to access through web page view gives me 403 error. I have cleared cache etc. Also uninstalled and reinstalled the abc mouse app. on phone... Went on a tablet and it does the exact same thing. It's very frustrating especially for my daughter. Can you please help solve the issue?,
"App was great, now it's not even working on my android. I don't understand. It freezes and will only stay in portrait mode on half of my phone....it's very frustrating. Am I doing something wrong or is the app bugin? I have tried multiple times to update it last year. I'll try again. Thanks so much!",
"App isn't working. Tried to cancel my subscription because my son doesn't use it anymore & there isn't anywhere to go to the parents section. When I try clicking on anything it either won't load or everything is squished. I tried going online & said to download the app to use it. So irritating! Update: FINALLY got it working to cancel my subscription, had to redownload the app. Was pretty laggy & slow but I was able to do what I needed to. Hopefully they get the app working for those who love it.",
"My children used this once. We purchased it at the mall a couple of years ago...we forgot about the app and we just seen a charge on our card for it. I have read horror stories of how it's nearly impossible to cancel the service and that even after you do, they still continue to charge you. People have to eventually cancel their cards in order to stop this company from taking money from them. When you do cancel, take a screenshot of the confirmation for your bank and later for bill collectors.",
"This is a great app with one major flaw, as far as I can tell there is no way to lock your child on to the learning path or any other of the more educational sections. Not everything on it is educational. For example the avatar, my daughter will spend hours just changing her avatar's hair and clothes. I wish it had better parental controls so I could so I could let her play by her self and still feel like she is learning.",
"The app Freezes and stops ""responding"" ALL THE TIME! We've had several devices in the course of having our membership, and each device we have the same exact problem. Everything is up to date, and we've Un installed the app several times. NOTHING WORKS!",
I didn't even use my free trial. I have a strong internet connection and brand new galaxy s10 that has more than enough memory and ram and I can never get the app to load unless its 15 to 20 minutes between screens. I have a 4 year old and this wait time is just not working as a learning tool. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. I will not reccomend it to anyone.,
"All 3 of my grandchildren use ABC mouse. It has been great for the 7 year old who struggles in school, the 3 year old is getting a good head start and my 2 year old is excelling and it has even helped improve his verbal skills. I highly recommend this app to anyone caring for a child.",
"Great learning games for all ages, my daughter loves abc mouse. The only issue we have is the load time is ridiculously long, therefore I canceled my subscription because I cant see paying for something that only works ""sometimes"" and there are tons of FREE learning websites that work perfectly. Disappointed we couldn't get resolved, it really Is a great website.",
"Great learning app for children preK to 8yrs old. Could be a little easier to navigate if you are the child, say more self explanatory or use more pictures to explain things. Maybe for the parents too. Maybe I just dont use it enough to know about all the ins and outs of the app though. Puzzles could be a bit harder to do, they seem to be silly easy. Possibly will get harder as child gets older...?",
"My son was excited about this at first. But over the last year of my paid subscription, the app got stuck every time he played it.with an updated app version. Very frustrating. And now on to my current issues...I'm trying to cancel the auto renew for this app...the parent log in page is stuck and I cant get to the settings-cancel policy page to cancel the '#$%^&* app. No where is there a phone number. Filled out a form when I googled abc mouse to contact. I'm just gonna guess they wont respond",
"For some reason my review disappeared. The login screen is broken and unresponsive. It should be in landscape mode but instead it is in a stretched out portrait mode. The developer suggested removing and reinstalling the app which I did, but it didn't fix the issue. I also sent an email to the developer about this. If the developer doesn't have an interest in fixing this then maybe legal action needs to be taken since they are effectively selling a broken app.",
"Dreadful, the layout is old fashioned, the accessibility is awful, would not reccomend to any young individuals as a learning platform at all costs. Having wanted to cancel my subscription, seemingly the app kept on freezing on the cancellation page trying to deny me the right of cancelling the app. This is something to be ashamed of.",
"I was signing up today with the free trial and it asked if I wanted to add the annual for 59.95 and I said no, then it popped up offering 6 months for 29.95 so I said ok, all of a sudden it goes to a screen that said my card was charged for 59.95, instantly it took it and wouldnt let me try to remove it. Now I see horrible reviews about people trying to cancel and still being billed after cancellation was done, how it is impossible to reach them on the phone since an actual person never answers and no emails get returned. So I have emailed twice, tried to call and of course the at closed. It would give me an uninstall option here like other apps and says I have to go into the app to cancel and I cant open the app so I cant use, cant cancel and was billed an unauthorized amount. I will be contacting the bank Monday to dispute this because this seems like a horrible scam unless I receive an email saying they have cancelled, refunded and will not charge me. A respond on e from the company saying to contact them only proves the point more, I have tried! Respond to my emails! I want this app unistalled and nothing to do with this company!",
"I downloaded this for a very very short time, seen it on T.V. thinking it would be great with how they were selling it on T.V..... butttttt noooooo, its awful, freezes, glitchy and just faulse advertising. I'm sure it would be great if it worked but it does not, don't be fooled people. Untill they fix the bugs I'm staying well clear (such a shame).",
"Not toddler friendly. The layout, popups for prizes...it just isnt fun for a 2 or 3 yr old. This app lags soooo much. Every click on anything takes forever to load, i dont see how any toddler waits, constantly (realistically, little ones just dont wait). My son never wants to play so im just going to cancel my subscription unfortunately. There are so many kid friendly educational apps out there that offer so much for free! Why pay $10 a month...",
"Installed this for my son so he can start learning at an early age but there's no way I'm paying $10 a month for an app when I can find others that will do the same thing for free or better yet teach him the old fashioned way by doing it myself. Wanted something that was easy and fun that would keep his interest, I'd be more willing to pay between $3-$5 each month which is reasonable but not $10.",
"This app was great when we 1st installed, but every since the new update it is horrible! We have to restart our tablet every few minutes just to get anywhere on it. Very sad that we are going to have to switch to a different teaching app, since this taught my autistic son extremely well.",
"Lots of negative reviews regarding crashing, freezing and glitches. I feel like if it's a good product the free trial would be easier to fully access and be more fun. It seems too much like being trapped into a subscription for an unfinished product or a product that i can't really test for my kid. It's sus so I'm uninstalling.",
"App will not rotate to correct view on android tablet. Tablet is on auto rotate. Website and information is in landscape view, but the app only opens in portrait view. Update! My husband emailed the company and they gave us a new app to download. So, had to uninstall the original, then install the new one and it seems to be great. It is int he correct view and we are able to play the app as it should. Excited to get started!",
"The Delay is Awful! We have yet to use this app on any device and have a seamless experience. Constant delays, total freezes, or just glitchy art pages or music that won't let you finish. I'm embarrassed that I've spent so much every month on this. Cancelling our subscription. Such potential wasted.",
I was really happy at first then the app stopped working. It just froze and no. It says I'm offline when clearly I'm not as I'm also writing this review. I have also sent an email to customer service and I have not heard anything back. I can't even cancel my subscription because app is not working and the website just sends me to download app first.,
I pay for this app and it has been stuck on the same learning path activity. There is no way to override it or reset it without losing all the progress my son has made. The only way to contact customer service is through email. after over a week i was informed that the system has been fixed for everyone except that's not true because my son's account is still stuck. I uninstalled app from tablet and phone many times the issue continues. I have tried on the computer still stuck.,
I can't even tell you my experience because it won't work on our tablet or my phone. I can log in but never get past that. All other apps work on both devices. Seems I'm not the only one having these issues. Neither devices are old so I don't know what's up. Just a poor app. Hopefully I can cancel it sometimeys soon and not get billed,
"I registered yesterday as a new customer , after payment was done am not able to access the website or app, horrible won't recommend",
"During the coloring activity they cannot use the free color option because it does not work, they lose interest during the song activities which display just words (would have been better to use a bouncey ball that would jump on the word being sung), constantly have to reset the puzzle level for each and every puzzle bc it starts on 1,bought brand new tablets thinking it would help the app to not freeze but it didn't,take a very long time for the app to start, long load times,bought stuff useles",
The newest update is awful. It freezes while you are playing and barely works. I'm thinking about canceling my membership because of the issues. I can't get it to work ever and I'm wondering why I'm paying for it to not work. I make sure I have the latest update installed and that I restart my device. This is definitely annoying,
"ABCmouse is great at ripping you off. I didn't realize I was still being charged. When I saw it on my bank statement, I went to cancel... They say you can cancel from the site, but it wouldn't allow me to. When i log in, It says i must download the app... We haven't used it in atleast 6 months. I shouldn't have to give them another download to cancel.",
"lags and force closes more than anything I've ever seen. pitiful for such an expensive app. update 7-31-19 after an update I was forced to log back in. Forgot my password. Have used ""forgot my password"" multiple times and never received the link. contacted support 2 or 3 days ago with no response. My kid loves the app but it has never worked completely correct on Galaxy S8+. Hangs and force closes at least once in every 20 minutes of use. Will probably be discontinuing the subscription.",
I love the content and so does my 2 year old but the app is so slow and sometimes unresponsive. She loses interest when a game takes too long to load or when she has to hit the same button 10 times before it works. I was so excited to try ABC Mouse but the free PBS app runs more smoothly :(,
"I used to like this app for my son. I got it for him when he was 2. Though it was REALLY slow and buggy and crashed at times, when you could get it to work, it was pretty cool. However, as time went on, my son got really bored with it. It's really repetitive with the coloring and reading stuff and he gets tired of doing coloring page after coloring page. Today. I went to open the app to see if there was a way to JUST work on learning to tell time. Couldn't get the app to load. Think I'm done.",
I just found out that they have been double billing me since January! Apparently I had an old account that I did cancel on my end but they failed to update. A few months later i decided to try again but cancelled again after it didn't meet my expectations. And to make matters worse they refuse to refund me for the double billings!,
"I'm going to be very upset if I'm charged even a single penny. I've been trying to cancel my free trial ever since I opened it. I even downloaded the app like it wanted me to, because the site won't let me do anything online. Then I open the app and it won't do anything but show me a yellow background with the mouse. So frustrating. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted the phone. Nothing working. CANCEL MY ACCOUNT!",
"I have paid for a full year. It's been a month and I cant use it. When I download the app, it goes into loading mode. The screen is yellow blue and just flips over in over none stop! Please help! I need a ph or site for customer support to fix this problem asap ir give me a refund of $19.99 and $59.99.",
"The app still needs fixing. When my child tries zooming in when reading a book, it doesn't zoom anymore. It used to. Now it just switches pages back/forth. We tried the ""pinching"" method and double-tapping, but still nothing. It would also be great if there was a way to differentiate the books that are automatically read to the ones that are not (at readers own pace). It would be great if this gets fixed.",
Kiddo liked it in the beginning but when we went up to a K level all we get now on our learning path is puzzle after puzzle. It's super annoying. Our favorite part was playing the games w the little robot that taught early reading skills but now we can't find it as the menu has changed. And not being able to delete pets in the pet park is EXTREMELY ANNOYING,
"Got this app because the fall school year is to be taught at home. Was very hopeful but after paying for a full year subscription the reading portion never loads! I would love for kids to be able to get at home education through an app but I am not sure if this is the one. 10 million downloads and pretty good reviews, yet we can't access what we paid for! Please fix.",
"Awful. I've had an account for 5 weeks and not once have I ever been able to actually use it. Everytime I log in it just freezes. Computer or App. Doesnt matter. They both do the same thing. I updated my computer, redownloaded the app and jumped through every other hoop i could think of to get it to work for my kids. Still nothing has changed. I do not recommend ABCmouse. Hopefully i can get my money back or cancel my account.",
This app works when it wants and how it wants sometimes the lessons will open and work and sometimes they won't sometimes he can feed his dog sometimes he can't. It literally just stops loading at the yellow page before you get where you actually need to be. How annoying.,
"My kids used to love it, but after a recent update it is inexplicably playing TalkBack while loading (which is not enabled in my Android system settings) then the screen is entirely unresponsive in the app other that hitting the back key bring up a exit prompt, maybe expects a dexterity device to be used? All access features are off. Clearing cache, data, and un/reinstall does not fix. Update: still a problem, official advice=uninstall parental controls?! For ONE app for kids >8? NOPE!!!",
"A few years ago I used and loved this app for my preschooler. I don't know why they changed the app to it's current format, but it's AWFUL difficult to navigate, what the heck happened to the adventure mode? Also, all these problems are only apparent if you can even get it to load up in the first place which I rarely can. I'm so sad! We used to love ABC Mouse!",
"The content is amazing! If you can get to it. I understand that some phones, tablets and other devices may just be SLOW. But not my S9. It's a super fast phone so the issue has to be with the app itself. I'm a pretty patient person and this app pushes that to the limit. So how is my 3 year old supposed to endure the loading screens. Did have some issues creating my kids' profiles but it did get fixed only after catching attitude from the rep. I say, save the money and use the free apps.",
"You guys need to go ahead and fix the issue with this app freezing, and stop telling people to contact you to fix the issue. Enough people have complained that the app freezes at the sign in page. It's really frustrating for me, esp my kid. The app is not free. So fix the issue. It's been acting up for months...",
"I used to really like and reccommend this app/program for my kids, but lately, they can't even do anything on it because it keeps crashing, or it won't load. Initially, I only ever had that issue on my phone, but now it is happening on the tablet as well. This makes me very sad because my kids love ABCmouse, and now they are disappointed every time they want to learn on it and are unable to.",
"PARENTS, DO NOT waste your money on this. you will only add stress to your life as the app is non-responsive and it is near impossible to cancel. touchscreen does not work in this app. had to download to try and cancel subscription. there are no ""forgot user ID"" or ""forgot password "" options anywhere. I'm just trying to cancel.",
"Decent, but there are some accessibility issues. My daughter is left handed and gets frustrated with some of the puzzle games because they are made for right handed people. When pulling with the left hand it's hard to see where the puzzle piece goes. I wish ABC mouse had a left handed mode, so I'm ranking 3 stars.",
"So slow. I see I'm not the only one dealing with how slow this app is. It will actually freeze and it's frustrating. I've tried going to app feedback and nothing, can't access it. The whole point of an app is to make it easier to use especially for your little ones, it's been the opposite!",
"I can't fix my child's app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but the problem is the same-- you have to double tap on everything! Trying to sign in is impossible because I have to double tap every single letter! I don't know why the app does this, but my 12 month subscription is now unusable and I'm very upset because my child loves his learning games.",
"Even though I specified my child's age as 3, there were screens and activities that were more appropriate for 6 and older. This frustrated my child to the point she wouldn't use it. I contacted customer service about this and they sent me a auto reply about the specs needed to run the program. They didn't even bother reading my comment. Now I'm continually getting annoying ads for ABC Mouse. I would NOT recommend for under age 5.",
"We love abc mouse, both of my daughters (3 & 6) are doing great on the app. Alot of the time they would rather go play games on abc mouse rather than to go on you tube to watch videos, which is always ok with me. the way that it is customized to your kids is amazing, I just love it. And right we need this more than ever since the kids are not in school. wish I could rate it more than 5 stars.",
"You have to download an app to use ABC mouse. I didnt know. I was able to sign up and everything through my phone then once it gets your information it says you need to download an app. Well I dont have enough room on my phone and we do not have lap tops or anything. I cant cancel my payment or subscription cause guess what you have to download the app. So once I get apps removed from my phone that I really need and use, I can finally download the app only to to run into an error. REALLY!!!",
"I've downloaded the app, but it wont load right...ever. it opens in a tiny window that cuts the screen content in half an you cant access the rest of it. I have deleted it and reloaded it several times. My kid hasnt even been able to do ANYTHING on it because we cant get to it.",
"The ABC Mouse content is wonderful and I would gladly give it 4 or 5 stars were it not for the atrocious app itself. It runs so poorly and crashed so often on the iPad we had to give up and use an android tablet. On the android, the load times and lag are so bad as to be nearly as bad as the unstable iPad. While I'm grateful there are no ads, a paid subscription app should not be of such poor quality. I cannot stress this enough, the content is great, the app is unforgivable!",
"This app is terrible! It doesn't allow you to lock any section of it so if you turn your back your child could end up watching T.V. instead of learning something, there is no way to track their progress (contrary to what the FAQ says), it wouldn't let me contact customer service and worst of all the few parental controls I did put in place don't even work! This app has great potential but terrible execution. The thing I'm most upset about is there seems to be know to fix these glitches!",
"I hoped of having a good experience with this after seeing all the raved reviews on tv but this app did not give me the chance to even comment on the content, it constantly glitches and freezes I was only able to set up i could not watch a video or play a game. I'm afraid I'll have to cancel my subscription until then please fix these issues",
"I have been a subscriber for over 2yrs. At first there was good content especially the math Shapey characters and nano the robot. The company ""updated"" their content and removed the most educational portions of the product without any notification. Now you have to buy a seperate subscription for them and it's not even available in my country. The learning path is also difficult to tailor to the child's education level in different subjects and it is very slow to progress.",
"Very easy to sign up for the free trial and hand over your card details. The experience kind of goes downhill after that. This app is very, very slow. The monthly cost after the free trial is way too high. My kids get too bored and impatient waiting for it to load up. Please can you confirm that my membership has actually been cancelled. I do not wish to be forced to pay for such a dreadful app.",
OK app but has its draw backs. The app along with the additional 7 apps that are included with your membership are only compatible with the most update OS and does not work with PC. So you pay for it but are very limited on full accessibility to content. I now have to purchase a new fire Tablet or any other compatible up to date OS device in order to use my membership. Anywhere Teacher is a more preferable teaching app. It is much like ABC mouse but in my opinion better because it meets national educational standard and is more accurate to the curriculum of a real school and has much more content.,
"Rich content but the application is a disaster and by no means is Android friendly. Slow, frustrating, and extremely heavy. To make it worse recently been getting disconnected in the middle of a lesson saying no connection, while I have a strong signal and other apps work fine. Glad I didn't pay, no point of content if you can't navigate it.",
Can't Cancel subscription. I have been trying to cancel my subscription for a while now but I always get pulled away. Now I logged online cancel and it wants me on use the app. I open the app and it stays in yellow screen. I been paying for years and not even using the app. Get at taking your money but when you want to stop paying for it. It doesn't allow you to do it.,
"I've been charged for the 6 month price option. Yet have tried unsuccessfully for the past week, to cancel. This was not the correct learning tool. I'd appreciate either an email address link to officially cancel. I also haven't even downloaded the app. Update: 5/3/22 Didn't realize that ABCMouse had continued deducting the 12.99 even after following the steps as directed. 1. Redownloaded the app. 2. Tried to signin. 3. Had to change password to sign in, I received ZERO links or responses. HELP",
Trying this for my 4 and 6 year old. Running it on a Samsung tablet. When the app works the kids enjoy it. It is fun and educational. But the app is very laggy and stop responding often. Ultimately it ruins the whole experience and leaves the kids frustrated half the time. Update: I am sure the developer comment is quite true. The kids do enjoy it when it works. Hope the infrastructure can handle it soon. Thanks for the quick response,
"Offers an array of lessons BUT the learning path goes by too quickly & there doesn't appear to be enough repetition w/o the parent clicking through the previous lessons to *review* what was taught, repeatedly. Which is a hassle as there are pages upon pages that then reset to the ""current lesson"". Another issue is w/ the pet section. My kiddo unattended for a few minutes purchased multiples of animals, w/o a way to remove them - it's now impossible to keep their needs met.",
"Paying for a program that offers nothing. My child can't learn anything on her with the constant freezing and the nonstop additional offers. Waste of money and time. Sticking with leap frog. At this point I want to cancel my subscription, but the website is not giving me the option to go in my account settings, and the app is a freezing yellow screen.",
My daughter is 2 and I just started Abc mouse with her. Right off the back i notice some things that use improvement. Like first in formost you need to change the interface for the younger children and filter the games for the appropriate age. Also have a child lock on it so my child can color and I dont have worry about her exiting the app. This app seems like it caters to older children. I'm thinking about deleting it and possibly reinstalling in a few years.,
"I like this app for the most part, at least I like the learning part. But there are too many distractions, I have to sit with my kids and make sure they stay on the learning activities or else they end up playing with the avatar or the fish tank or any of the other non-learning activities on the app",
I have redownload this a few times. I still cannot login because a keyboard will not show up. I will update my review if the problem is fixed. Edit: less than 12 hours later i received a response and it worked. Thank you for being so understanding. My kid loves this program and it better than tv on repeat while I am busy working.,
"the idea is great. the content is decent. the app is horrible for the following reasons: - so slow to load (on every device I've tried...on multiple networks) - no home button or way to get back to a start place easily - no menu or way to navigate easily to a specific activity I waited for the app to load for 3 minutes, then got frustrated and came here to write my review. it's still loading in the background. no progress bar. is it stuck? I don't know. developers, get your acts together",
I don't particularly care for this app for the simple fact that there is no way to cancel it! I've logged in on several different devices and I'm only getting prompted to renew my subscription. There is no gear at the top right corner no parent section or billing! I have been trying to cancel this application for months! There is no way to cancel it! I like the app for my son but he's only five it surprisingly doesn't hold his interest for very long because it's a bit complicated to navigate,
"Unfortunately, both ABC Mouse and Adventure Academy do NOT work on ANY of the devices we have in our house. Not even on my phone. The app just crashes and/or causes the device to overheat and then shut off. And I don't like the fact that I have to go through such a production in order to cancel subscription... Download the app, sign in 3 different times, asked several times ""are you sure""?",
"I think the app on a tablet is better than the desktop version, especially for younger kids who can't use a computer mouse very well. My experience has been great so far. My 4yr old is finally able to focus on something for more than 5 minutes, which is a great start! Baby steps!",
"Buyer beware. If you choose the annual subscription, and who wouldn't, you don't get the 30 day trial. Good luck finding glasses good enough to read that in the fine print. And when it comes to cancellation you'll get dizzy on the runaround that takes.",
"Price keeps raising! When I signed up, it was one free month then $9.99/month after that. My app was deleted and it's giving me a hard time to reset password. It won't work at all. So I went to see if I could try resigning up and then it now says it's $12.99/month! This app used to be free! This is ridiculous! There are plenty of other reward system Educational games for kids that are free.",
Well I bought the subscription with the intention of using the app but when I try to load it it just stays on the loading screen switching from landscape to vertical and back. I left it sit for 5 minutes doing this and gave up. Love the website hate the app.,
"My daughter loves this app but, it has not been working for months now. It opens up but when you click on things we just get a purple banner with a back arrow. I emailed customer service and all they said was that they know about the issue. No actual assistance at all. This isn't free software! Why would anyone continue paying for it if it doesn't work?!",
I signed up for a free month trial but instead was charged the annual fee. When I tried to email ABC mouse they said they cannot look into the billing account and I had to contact iTunes. I don't get how abcmouse can take my money but yet have no access to my billings account. Wish I never signed up for the free trial as I am now subscribed for a whole year without the discounted price,
"I tried this out for 2 months for my 3-year old since he's not in school yet. The content was way too easy for him and the learning path games were generally non-engaging (even when I upped the levels). Eventually, he'd only do them to take care of his pets, since they'd ask him to play occasionally. After a while, all he cared about was reorganizing and running his hamster mazes. That's it. I'm not going to pay a monthly subscription for what devolved into a hamster maze game...",
"Ever since the pandemic, my daughter has been so frustrated with ABC mouse. The app never loads. The app used to work great. She loved to do her learning path and now she can't. I am disappointed with the fact that I'm paying for a service my daughter can not use. Will change my rating when this problem gets resolved!",
Waste of money so far. A lot of the activities don't work whether we try it on my phone or computer. Everything ends up freezing or just not working- the backgrounds are there but the activities don't load. Not very happy about spending $50 for something as glitchy and flawed as this app/site. My daughter was so excited for this but she just ends up disappointed because a lot of it doesn't work and she gives up and does other things instead.,
"we have been trying to teach my siblings how to read, we got this app because it was good apparently, but its too distracting, it has too many games and not enough learning, i know its supposed to be fun, but having them the ability to buy stuff and have pets (yeah ik it teaches them about responsibility) but we need them to read, they get carried away with the colors and shapes that they allready know, if maybe you could add a setting that is strictly abcs and 123s with no songs or pets.",
"This app is very useful for small children just learning and exploring new things. My grandchildren have enjoyed it over the years, but somehow you can actually cancel the app itself. I canceled my subscription because my grandchildren no longer use the app, but there is still a monthly charge for using the app. It gives you directions to remove, but I can‚Äôt remove it from google play app. Other than that, overall the game is really. Wonderful for learning.",
"Stuck on an activity. We got stuck on an activity and couldn't progress further. We tried uninstalling and reinstalling, deleted cookies and cache and it still was stuck. Was unable to resolve the issue so I unsinstalled and cancelled our subscription. Waste of money and couldn't get help besides what I already tried from customer service.",
"freezes and crashes, takes forever to load on all my devices. i will not be renewing subscription. compared to other free and cheap education apps out there ABC Mouse really doesnt seem worth it, and i got it at it's cheapest price. definitely not worth full price.",
"I didnt even got to open the app and i already having problems logging in and the app wouldn't even open. very frustrated. want to cancel im not changing my mind, im not going to let my kids get frustrated as i am right now with this app. i can see that only processing the payments works very well. What is that telling you.",
"Once they have you. It's hard to leave. I've been trying to cancel my subscription all morning and the app keeps BSing me. Bringing me back to pay instead of cancel. Cancel option is not even there. But the payment page say easy to cancel anytime. Yea right, that's a LIE. I hate when these companies purposely try to make it difficult to not pay them anymore. I feel like they are robbing me and others. I'm pretty good with tech so imagine some grandma who's stuck paying them forever. I'm üò°",
"App is great and beneficial. My 2 year old is now recognizing words throughout the day. She may see the word pop on a cup or rainbow on a package of cookies or even read the smallest random word on a box, but she is still reading. In about 6 months my child was able to master the ABC'S, shapes,colors, and numbers 1-12. The app is trying to show her how to trace all these as well as her name but she's a little impatient. My advice is let your kid go with it at first. Its ALL educational.",
"I just paid for a full year for my granddaughter. We love abcmouse, but the app needs some work. It sometimes loads slow. The activities on the learning path will freeze & you have to do the same one over & over to finish it & go onto the next activity. It's frustrating for my granddaughter, but she is really loving all the content on here & I love the fact she is intetested in learning. Can you please fine tune the app & address these issues?",
"It's March 2020, and I've just created an account and subscribed. The app is so slow, and my daughter has a 1.5 second attention span. After 1.5 seconds, she will hit the home button on the Samsung 9.7 tablet. We have no issues with internet. Our speed right now is 100.00 +/- MBPS down, 35 MBPS up. It's not just the tablet, the browser app is slow as well. There's a congestion right now due to a lot of users working from home because of a Pandemic. The app is not built with scalability in mind in case of a surge in traffic. I've just cancelled our account (after signing up 70 minutes ago).",
"Each learning objective is done in a fun way, my daughter looooves it. She begs me to use it. She likes winning tickets to customise her house. She has asked for friends in the house so come on ABC, extend the rewards area. Kids love the concept. It is mainly for reinforcement of learning at school though, the lesson are very short, so kids dont mind repeating but not as critical as learning at school",
"Fantastic app. I do wish I could set lesson plans from the main app, not from the other apps. I also wish that from the search page, it would go back to what I searched for instead of having me research. Otherwise the app is awesome. Loving the new content and printables that are being added!",
"I just signed up for this and it's not working at all. I open the app and there's no option to select any game...it's stuck on the homepage on the app. the website just says to download the app. The email has no instructions either. I want to cancel now, feeling frustrated but there's no option for settings or info either!",
Stuck after few levels. Having blank screens. No help from tech. No refund. Uninstalled and installed twice in less than a month as instructed by tech. Still in same position. I regret getting this as a Christmas gift. My child is constantly frustrated!,
"The app itself is not terrible. The only real issue I have come across is the bubble pop games do not want to register touch, and those ones are my daughter's favorites. I wish that would be fixed, because her having meltdowns multiple times a day because it won't work is extremely frustrating.",
does good when it actually works have had the app for little over a year and have had nothing but problems with the app freezing up and running really slow or just randomly turning off and after recent update it's just gotten worse . please fix the problems or I'll just cancel our subscription,
"Just had my subscription cancelled. I had to renew my subscription, i use to pay 9.95/mo. I chose a yearly subscription of 59.40 with an option, i chose btw, to bill the 59.40 spread out as a 4.95/mo charge. It is a special right now. According to their workers they don't offer that. I was charged 59.40 + 9.95 all today. I had to renew my subscription, chose a different one that apparently doesn't exist and was charged for both! I cancelled. NOt worth it",
The song activities arent engaging my 3yo since they just show the lyrics. I wish they were like the music videos from the other app but oh well. I also wish it was more difficult for the kids to back out of an activity like they have to hold the 'x' for 3 secs or something.,
"Horrible It is impossible to cancel your subscription for the last 2 months they have been trying to debit my account for a supposedly cancelled subscription, I have contacted them through email as well as spent over a hour over the phone to refund my money and cancel the subscription.. and today they tried to debit my account again",
I don't know what's going on but this app is not right. It's only allowing me to sign into some library called Locust something. Where as on our previous device with the app downloaded it works just fine. When you use the browser it works just fine on the same device. YOUR APP IS A PROBLEM FIX IT ASAP. Total inconvenience!!!!,
"Not actually a free app. Just installs the software which then requires you to create an account to actually use. After this you'll be auto billed unless you cancel. I didn't bother, just uninstalled. This is just an advertisement for a subscription you install on your phone, not an app.",
"App wont work on brand new android phone or tablet. My toddler does not yet know how to use a laptop mouse and the touch screen on the tablet or phone is ideal for the age group targeted. Why is there an app if it does not work.?? Its a great program and my older son loved it once he was able to use a laptop mouse correctly, but my 2 year old gets to use another program now I guess.",
"I love the program! Content is amazing, my grandchildren enjoy learning using it. However, Id like an APP for my laptop. And I'd appreciate it if it wasn't so slow. At times it freezes for a few seconds which is frustrating to 3&4 year olds.",
The app is very buggy. Constant reloading and restarting in order to get the app to work. My daughter's have lost interest in it because of that. Luckily both of my daughter's have teachers that recommended different apps that offer the same educational advancement. I suggest asking the child's teacher for their suggestions before paying for this service considering its inconsistent interface.,
Freezes frequently. When loading activities on the learning path the app often freezes and you can't get to the activity. I close out of the app and sometimes it still happens multiple times. It makes the app very frustrating for my 4 year old.,
"Update; we are now having issues no longer being able to access the classroom or ANYTHING, my son use to LOVE the classroom & doing the level things that included puzzles/reading to him & feeding the fish!! Now be can't do any of it. WHAT DO I DO? I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Honestly, we've had ABC for almost 2 years. I had one bad experience when the game would freeze and crash, & that was resolved almost immediately. I do not mind paying 12.99/mo for my son to play and learn as he goes.",
The app is so frustrating to use. From sitting on a perpetual yellow screen to being insanely slow even on a high end device. The website is such a chore to navigate for the exact same reason demanding you download the app to do anything with your account. The app is even more laggy and slow on my child's device. Cost is too high and you have to pay more for child assessments which should be included.,
not easy to use. takes too long to continue with anything. if I want to change anything it will ask for the password every single time. my kids have been using the tablets since they were 6 months old and 2 years old (now 5 & 7)... so it is not our devices... it is the app... once in they do have fun learning...,
"I would not recommend this. Way too many things going on and the navigation is not seamless..for ex: art alphabet..after u finish A, one would expect B loads to keep.thr activity going. You will need to step back and choose. You guys REALLY need to revamp the design. While Spanish is important, there has to be a way to block it/hide it.",
"I started my naughter in school abit later and that affected her speech. She has learned sooo much in such a short space of time from this programme its made my life easier during this pandemic. Sometimes i dont even need to monitor her,she knows how to navigate through it and the games are so educational its amazing. Definitely recommend it",
Worst app ever for any child to learn. It is not made for children with disabilities like dyslexia. Tried for 2 years and it was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. The commercials are just spammy junk that is unrealistic and untrue. Don't waste your money or time on this app. All it does is disappoint the already frustrated parents and kids who are struggling with reading and math. Would give zero stars if the option was available. Worst app ever. Lost too much money on a garbage app.,
"I haven't had any issues& we're a week in so far. My son is stubborn & I have to basically sot down & try but once he gets into, he stuck until I ask if he's done. I like it, my son likes it, and when my youngest is old enough I'll start him on it as well. I think for the price I paid, it's worth it. Deals pop up, take advantage of it while it's there. Blessed be.",
"This app has never worked right for us! The ""games"" for my 2 year old require READING! HE'S TWO! And now, after the update, nothing works! I try to select literally ANYTHING and it quint let me. I rebooted my phone and everything. Total waste of my hard earned money! It won't work on his brand new tablet either, so it is not device specific. I'd give 0 stars if it would allow. And, now, after submitting my review, I see that others are having the same issues. I want my money back!",
My daughter loves the app when it's working. I wanted to try the 30 days trial before paying for a subscription but now I don't know if I'll subscribe since the app doesn't work. it freezes constantly doesn't upload the videos. I won't pay $60/year for something that doesn't work,
"This program does not load and will not work on any of my 4 device ranging from phones, tablets, and computers. When I e-mailed them to say this was an issue and I had seen other people were experiencing this, they had a series of questions I needed to fill out to ensure it wasn't my devices. I already planned to cancel when I went online to research them further. To my surprise they are affiliated with Scientology. Even more reason to save your money!",
"Was just charged $40 without asking if I wanted to renew my subscription. Also, it would be great if it actually worked., runs slow, glitches. Not happy. Will be contacting my bank to dispute charge and will no longer be using abcmouse.",
"Our sons love this app so much that they want to be on it multiple times a day. It has helped them recognize letters and animals, listen to directions, follow directions, and so much more. There have been a few times of the app running slowly, I won't lie about that, but it's helped in teaching our boys patience so we don't mind. It's affordable, and effective. I definitely recommend it for those who have 2 year olds.",
"Expensive and doesn't even load. I got the app to help my kindergartener. But after paying for the monthly subscription, it has never worked. It's updated and I've tried everything I can do to fix it. I've now wasted several months of payments because I can't even get it to load so I can cancel the monthly subscription. I'd give it zero stars if I could!",
"The app is frustratingly slow, it's very hard to make my kids to wait for 5 minutes to get to do something because they want instant fun and it's almost impossible even for me to figure out what's supposed to come after i tap on an activity that randomly loads or not, that I have to go back and forth to make it work as it should. That should not be like this. It's getting slower and slower over time, please fix!!!!",
"The activities and books are fantastic. My son is very much enjoying the app. For me as the parent, the app is Infuriating! God forbid you need to sign in to adjust settings, the app doesn't let you in and forces you to create a new password which will also not work. In my case, my son gets super distracted by the pet section & there is no way to disable or disallow him to access it. For such a popular app, it freezes too often. Super frustrated by this app.",
"Farm Animals: Sheep Animation in Space Level Freezes/Locks up after clicking. Does this on multiple Android devices and multiple users at same spot. Tried reinstalling and that didn't solve. To fix this issue we used an iPad to get then past this spot. Once they got past it, they were able to continue again on Android.",
"I am having problems w/ ABC Mouse. The Learning path freezes up when you click the activity & the white chalkboard freezes when clicked. Happens on both Android & Apple tablet. A hard reboot is required to get out. Once back in, it does the same thing over again at the same places. it worked 2 wks on the Ipad with no problems. When it started freezing we loaded it on an Android tablet and had the same problems. it has it has not worked for over a week.",
"App is slow even on the same high speed wifi that we use to play and stream online gaming. So my kid didn't use it after a couple of tries. Got a year subscription with a discount, so it was a waste. Then, the kicker is that they automatically renew the subscription like an illegitimate scam business. Saw the charge, so I canceled thinking I'd just pay an extra month, but they refuse to refund the yearly charge. I don't appreciate the poor business practices, and I hope other parents don't either",
SCAM ALERT!!! Says you can unsubscribe but takes your money and doesn't let you log in or unsubscribe. When you can log in it crashes constantly on every device and is full of bugs. Would love it if it was something you can use but it isn't and it takes your money month after month with no way to contact anyone or stop it. Save the headache...I wish I did.,
"Great learning app for toddlers. My two year old loves ABC mouse. She is 27 months and has already mastered her ABC, shapes, colors and she can count and recognize all her numbers to 10. She has begun basic mathematics of addition and subtracting. Great app for eager learners and even children who may need confidence to love every subject matter.",
"waste of money! The app runs that slow that the child gets bored with waiting, a lengthy amount of time, between each activity. Thought it may just need the update but that just made it worse. We have only been able to use it a handfulof times because of this.",
I'm paying for this app and I like the activities and info but it sucks for performance. I can't log in on my Galaxy 10+ and its super slow on my laptop. Idk if it's just me but this drives me mad. By the time it loads my kids are off to something else. I'm just ready to cancel. too expensive to not function properly.,
"The app was fun while it lasted, but I can no longer get the app to work. Because if this I have decided to cancel my subscription, however even that seems impossible to do. The support staff is incompetent at best & say that the email on file, plus my name & card number are not on file, even though they have no problem charging me every month. This is ridiculous and beyond frustrating. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB",
Got a full year subscription for my 3 year old and already regretting the purchase. The app started off slow and has only gotten slower as we have progressed through the learning track. There is no point in having it on her tablet when the loading screen take forever and neither of us has the patience for it.,
"So far, the app has crashed and lagged more times that I can count making for a very unhappy 2 year old. Not happy to have spent the money for this and to have a continuing problem with this. When the app is working, it's wonderful and we love it, but it seems it's more problems that good at this point",
"liked this app and the idea of it for my daughter but it has a glitch in the learning path when you get past the first gift you canot do anymore activities the avator will swim to where you click but you cant play anything, ive tried closing the app turning on and off tablet and still the learning path will not work... sucks because my 3 year old loved it so far! if doesnt get fixed im goin to have to cancel my prescription....",
"I haven't been able to even try the game for a couple of seconds when it asks you to get a subscription. First month might be a free trial, but still not free, this should be clearer in the headline of the game. I cannot see a way to get out of that screen and try the game without registering all my details first for the trial.",
"Be careful, the payment is subscription based and will automatically take money out of your paypal account. I didnt realise this and no renewal notice is sent by company for obvious reasons. App failed to meet expectations and had frequent difficulties getting access to my account. Would never have paid for another 12 months if the company didn't sneakily take the payment without forewarning. I suggest everyone google ‚ÄòSubscription trap‚Äô before purchase.",
My child loves it. She's 3 and she plays the same gmes and is learning new stuff after each game. So far she likes to pop bubbles and the puzzles. We stay on the learning path and do a couple of sessions there. You have to pay a monthly fee of 9/10 bucks its worth it if your child learns.,
Great app to help children enjoy learning. The curriculum is well developed and effective for improving a child's knowledge. My 18 month old increased his knowledge significantly since he has been using ABC mouse. He is now 23 months and he's on preschool level 2! My 7 year old also enhanced her knowledge about a variety of subjects!,
"Terrible. Is it better than sitting your kids in front of cartoons? Yes. But by a smidgeon. The claims that this enhances literacy, math, etc, are absolutely ludicrous. There's indeed a ton of content, but it's absolute rubbish. Especially noteworthy are the UX, which is an unmitigated disaster, and the technical issues (on what's otherwise a really low-tech game app), which are positively dismal, both on the app and the web version. Don't fool yourself for a second thinking that this has any sort of educational value, on any conceivable level.",
"Best learning app ever. I've tried different subscription and apps and my toddler wasn't really interested. Now all she wants to do all day is learn on ABCmouse. Great layout, easy to use, and fun rewards that keep her entertained. I will recommend this to every parent I know!",
have been using this app for my kids for years and have never had any issues until now. as soon as i load the app it keeps switching from landscape mode and portrait mode over and over non stop. makes app completely unusable. please fix or im going to need a refund on my purchase. will be 2 star until fixed.,
What is going on?! This app is super slow and keeps crashing. I downloaded it to help my kids while school is out because of covid 19 but it's not helping much. Every 10 minutes I have to restart it and half there time it won't start back up...,
"I'm giving it a 5 stars because its a wonderful teaching aid, and its not only because of the various activities and lessons my kiddo can access but also because it teaches her how to use the computer (we use this mostly on a pc) The only problem I have is that sometimes the activities will freeze up or bug out, though its not really a big deal since they seem to work the next day or so.",
"Paid for the year subscription and I feel I'm not getting my money's worth when some of the activities on the learning path have bugs. It stops my child in it's tracks and they can't move forward. The only solution I found was to move the lessons up a level but by doing that, I feel my child is missing out on things to learn. This is the 2nd time this has happened. FIX THE BUGS!",
"Nothing about this app is free, it should be marked as a pay only app. Downloading it for free and not being able to do anything with it unless you pay does not make anything free. There are many apps out there that at least allow you to demo part of it without having to pay for a subscription. This app does not allow me to test anything except the capability of downloading it.",
I got this app in june 2019 and I pay a monthly subscription that automatically comes out of my bank account. My son no longer needs the program any more so I've been trying for the last 3 months to cancel and it want let me. I have done every single thing it has asked me to do and yet this monthly subscription still comes out of my account. there is no phone # to talk to someone directly. This is very unacceptable that it is this hard to cancel a subscription but only took 3mins to join,
"I wish I could give it a higher rating, but it seems with every update it keeps getting more glitches I keep having to contact tech support, for glitching in the lessons more and more have been not marking complete, and its frustrating they should have something for the parent to over ride if the child has done it if the auto fails, its frustating to spend an hour on tech support telling to uninstall and reinstall. I have tried that first and I have it on 3 devices all have issues.",
"I have used the learning app to a part of my kids education at home for over 8 years. I like how is makes learning fun. How my son has learned to enjoy this app and it's games for free time instead of a game station. It is more calmer so less tantrums. I believe because the games are learning. I will continue to use till the kids grow out of abc mouse. Wish they had a whole elementary grade level pre-k to 6th grade. This app is fun for all, the whole family.",
"0 STARS .This app fraudulently charged my credit card this year after canceling the subscription in 2016! What a headache, no one answers customer support. Finally got someone on the chat option who acted like he was doing me a favor . To top it off, I had to then spend more time on the phone getting a new credit card number. DO NOT GET THIS APP. I have the transcript as proof, wish I could upload the images.",
"Theft! Purchased this app for my child, and it was so frustrating because the app gave us so much issues to load. My child lost interests because of the non stop loading everytime we ope the app. We ended not using it. However a year later we decided to try using it again. Come to find out once the subcription is up, we no longer have access to the program unless I purchase it again. So all the work that was done is being held hostage until we pay again. Which is theft to me. Stay away!",
"I created the account 2 days ago andnnownit won't let me log in at all. What a waste of a trial period if you can't use it! I cant get in to cancel the payment either. I'm not happy at all! Edit: there's a glitch in the app that needs fixing because about a half hour after I rated it, it allowed me in.",
"This app is terrible. Within 30 mins of download, I have to call and cancel my subscription. I couldn't even get to the parent portal to sign up and it started messing up. Now I have to jump through hoops to cancel it. The app screen get any bigger than the palm of my hand and i'm on my lapktop. Bad purchase on my part!!",
"it's great when it works. I had the add on games to go with it so my child could play offline and it worked a few times until we had an update, now it says we are offline and won't play. And the online app is so slow it can not keep a childs attention.",
"I signed up for a 30 day free trial, I've been charged twice already and theres absolutely no response from customer support. Save yourself the trouble and go with a different service. The app itself keeps crashing and does not work like it's supposed to.",
"I did love it...I bought the year membership, about 2 months in.. the app seemed like it got hacked, nothing worked and there was a voice over from a different language, I contacted they knew of the problem, the said they're working on it, and gave me 3 months free. Now about 2 months later, I reinstalled the app... the same thing is happening just the same voice but now in English.",
"The app was working fine at first then suddenly it froze up and when I went to go back into it, it brought up a blank yellow screen and wouldn't do anything else. Also, the stuff it ""gives"" for my child's age is too advanced and hard for a child his age.",
it freezes all the time and that is if you can even get it to open in the first place. I will not be renewing with them and wish I hadn't this year already. abc mouse was great when my older kids were little about 7 years ago. Somewhere the quality of abc mouse has gone down.,
"For the insane amount they charge, you would assume the app is quality and issues get fixed. This app is buggy garbage, and nothing gets fixed. When it works, it's fine, but it's not worth a subscription if that doesn't actually go to maintaining and improving the app.",
"App is highly unstable and resource intensive. Attempted to run on a Galaxy Note 8 and immediately got soft ""crashes"" where content wouldn't load. Just got my kids new Alcatel JOYTAB tablets and the app straight up hard crashes or sits on the load icon indefinitely. What's the point of the app if it can't even run? For a paid service program, I'm extremely dissatisfied and will be requesting a refund.",
"I love the concept but the app is not working at all. It used to glitch and freeze but now It won't even load. I downloaded on another device but it too says I'm not connected to wifi and will not load. I'm definitely connected seeing as I can write this review. Please , please make repairs to your app . The website has been hard to load but the app has stopped entirely. ABC mouse is great but the technical difficulties have been more than its worth latley .",
"The app is great on the right devices that are updated with strong wifi connection and used with CLEAN hands. So far I have had this app on a little scholar tablet, A 7inch LG tab and a galaxy tablet the little scholar tab lagged a little on certain games. We have started mainly using the website though as it is much easier. Their tech support wasn't helpful at all when my childs learning path stopped working. They offered no solution and closed my ticket. I did figure it out on my own, for anyone with that issue go to your parent settings and change their learning plan up or down a level, load it on their profile and then go back into your parent settings and put them back.",
"ok but kid lost interest during trial. if you do the trial, make sure to cancel immediately otherwise when you try to cancel just before the billing period the app conveniently hangs and you cant get access to account page. maybe im being cynical but it cxang hurt to cancel immediately, your child can still try and if you want to keep it you can just resubscribe.",
Great until it stopped working. Our avatar has been stuck on the learning path for 2 days and no matter what we can't get past this lesson that won't load. Tried emailing customer service and contacting them through facebook but so far no fix. My son is almost 3 and just started getting the hang of this and loving it so it's very disappointing to have this happen.,
I have issues of freezing and the log in page not opening up so for multiple attempts i would be sitting and looking at a yellow screen waiting to log in for up to 5 minutes before i close the app to try again. When its working my son loves the pet area of the app and gets frustrated when it freezes on him or for some reason the app closes itself on him,
"Desperately Needs a full blown update. This app is literally the same as when it first hit the markets. Now there are many other sites that offer better features, like being able to check proficiency at certain skills. The games are just okay at best with half of the assignments being just sing a longs with no visuals, coloring, and puzzles. Which aren't doing much to either entertain or educate my 5 or 7 year olds. To me ABC mouse is leaning on its name and less on content.",
The app works okay. The only problem I've encounter is that under the my learning path it gets stuck and won't allow the child to continue. It repeats the same activity and when continue button is pressed it goes back to the home screen. Other section work fine.,
It's horrible to navigate when it actually works. They make it near impossible to cancel a subscription and don't send a reminder email when its about to auto renew. I will not EVER recommend for this reason. So many other resources out there without the hassle.,
"This doesnt make any sense at all. I downloaded the app because the website says to. Only to be taken to a log in page. I go to log in and some weird voice starts talking. Says to ""double click to edit"" after to take your finger to swipe left or right. Go to put in your email and it literally doesnt fo anything.",
Being charged 2 times in one month. Charged more then the cost of membership. I can not cancel membership!!!! Since looking for other bad reviews I found other people are still getting billed well after they cancel. I have to cancel my bank account and my PayPal account. The app its self is highly overrated. You can get better apps for kids and better videos on youtube. Don't waste your money. I wish I could give - 5 starts. Stop stealing my money. Your getting reported enough is enough!!!,
"The servers speed is horribly slow. No matter the device or internet service, many of the apps functions will not load. It has been this way for quite some time since we have started using ABC mouse. Even on its good days, each activity will take a good few minutes to load.",
"I have just paid for my daughter to use this for the next 6 months and she has only been playing for about three days and now she is only on lesson three but its having her listen to the "" Brandons almost everything blue"" book on the learning path and she has listened to it for 2 days and it wont let her continue. This needs to be fixed or i want a refund. I have tried everything to figure this out on why it will not let her move past it.",
"Paid the coupon code price and can't even login. App glitches immediately after login and switches from portrait/landscape every second. I have updated both android and ipad systems and have uninstalled and reinstalled app about 4 times. What is worse is I have tried to contact developer and had zero support other than ""update your device and reinstall app""... Is this because I had a coupon code? Ridiculous.",
I just read previous reviews. Yes be very careful. I wanted to sign up for a month free. But they add things in to confuse you when signing up. So now I've been charged for a whole year. So yes be very careful. I see now they have done it more than once. And during a pandemic when people don't have disposable income is shysty.,
"I've used this and it has worked great for my 4 year old, but its very frustrating when the app doesn't allow you to move forward to the next activity, it just gets stuck, then my child can't move on idk what to do at this point i just wanna unsubscribe. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I've also tried logging in & out.",
"This app was worthwhile when my child was very young. It is non-aggressive and safe. However, the content is pretty weak for kids in kindergarten and above. What's worse, the unbelievably long load times and glitches dissuade kids from using it. Also, be sure to set your account to NOT automatically renew or you can expect a year's subscription without notice that can't be canceled or refunded.",
"Not toddler friendly. Most of these apps struggle to provide toddler friendly lessons or are too confusing. They also do not provide learning progression in a repetitive way. On top of this, there were major issues with the app freezing. I had to constantly reset the app and redo the lesson.",
"It is not a bad app, but if your child has no previous knowledge or someone walking them through the app or a parent even teaching them. The app focused too much on coloring ,winning tickets , and games. There is no learning. Not even at the early stages. Highly disappointed. Not recommended for kids without previous knowledge or already involved in school.",
"This app has been garbage for a long time. In classroom, level 1, artic lesson 12 (farm animation: cows), the app hangs on a blank screen. Thus, you are not able to advance in the lessons. This is not just an Android OS issue because the exact same issue occurs on the crApple iOS version.",
This app is great when it works but it has been frozen on the same lesson for my son for days and it just won't load. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times but it hasn't fixed the issue. It's really sad because my kids love the app. I'd really like some assistance from the service team.,
"I bought a 3 month subscription. The curriculum was too easy so I asked to be moved to 3rd grade. This is a different product. I was given a code that didn't work. School was indefinitely postponed due to covid so I signed up for a 1 month free trial for 3rd grade. Instead I was charged $59.99, and the grade level appropriate product sucks. The company didn't refund me. I essentially paid twice and never got what I needed.",
"Was very skeptical after reading all of the 1 star reviews but decided my daughter's success was well worth the price of a year subscription. We love it!! Not sure why your all having loading issues my daughters kindle fire loads almost instantly. My advice is you cant believe everything you hear or half of what you see! I would definitely recommend üòäüòÅ!!! Also the reason its not free is because it costs alot of money to develope an app, if it was free your child would be bombarded with ads!!",
"Seems to be a great app with lots of great learning material, but constantly locks up. On kids kindle it locks up every 15 minutes and takes multiple attempts to reboot. On my Samsung tablet, it will not work at all. So...if it doesnt work, how can I recommend it?",
Love the ABC mouse app when it's running smooth. Now for some reason it's stuck on a lesson and will not open or go past it. Will only allow me to go backwards in the lesson plan. Have already uninstalled twice and nothing has worked. Please help,
"""it's far too easy for my three-year-old granddaughter to accidentally set the difficulty too high"" The response provided is not accurate because the child is able to change the level in the learning path by playing with the options on the right of any activity and this changes the level for the remaining activities until I set it back.",
"This app crashes all the time when my son is trying to play a game or in the middle of a puzzle and I always have to start it back over, abc mouse doesn't really give what I'm looking for it mostly consist of puzzles and coloring I have bumped up his curriculum and still gives the same, for what I'm having to pay for it I'd rather just stick to the pen and paper kind of disappointed in this.",
DO NOT GET THIS APP I had it for a few months and it was fine. We canceled the subscription and I keep hurting charged anyways!! We don't even have the app anymore! I got charged 2 separate fees this month! One for 17.04 then 5.18 on the same day! We don't even have this app on our devices anymore. I deleted it once I canceled the subscription. Edit to ABC mouse response; It's been canceled its been deleted and still being charged.. after reading reviews it's seems this is a problem. Do better,
"I am stuck logging in . A voice guide automatically talks when I open app plus the apps keyboard isn't letting me type in my password or login information. ABC mouse keyboard is running super slow on the app. I did talk to customer support they did nothing , I did delete app reset my phone and get app again ... and yet the app still does all of the above . I just want my money back :(",
"Horrible. I signed up and wasnt even able to get through creating an avatar for my child (through the browser!) So i downloaded the app, such a waste of my time. Says my comp isnt compatible but yet the browser wasnt working before i downloaded the app soooo... Guess ill find something else bc they have to many bugs they need to fix.",
"It's great, my son learns new stuff and see little thing he can do to better his schooling, but it has a hard time keeping him going. It's very very repeative to the point he just did it and two games later they ask to do the same thing and he gets board of it.",
"I downloaded the app pay through PayPal and after it stuck in the welcome page in 2 different devices... I hope they can return the money they take from PayPal maybe no much but it is disappointed after 2 hours try to figure it why it doesn't work, maybe because I don't subscribed for a whole year... So I was initially dissatisfied with the design but my daughter wants to try it, anyway take my dollar no worries but don't count with us.",
"I've been charged 3 times now for this app that I doubt even have. I emailed the company about it and they were less than helpful. I don't have a computer. Couldn't cancel online after resetting the password (since I didn't actually create or, don't know how it was since), actually downloaded this app after seeing another PayPal charge of almost 17$ and couldn't cancel through that. I've now lost almost 60$ over something I didn't sign up for and the company has been unable to make it right",
Is not working with Chromebook. We've been using abc mouse for over 3 years and it worked alright but now not at all with Chromebook I get a blank yellow screen. We pay a lot of money for this app & we are very dissatisfied with it. I've reached out several times on the issue just to get ignored. My son loved abc mouse & now he's like abc who? If it's not compatible with Chromebook then maybe y'all should update the app to make it compatible or inform us that it won't work with Chromebook at all,
"Wonderful program. The kids love it and look forward to it. Would be nice, though, if the app would only go to the things or stories that are age-appropriate for that child working on it. I didn't always have time to work with the kids or didn't know what I was doing, so that could have been the problem. Had to stop using it, though because the father didn't want the kids addicted to the phone at a young age. Thank you for your product. It is excellent!",
I never even got to use the app...it Keating bouncing back and fourth between asking me a multiplication problem and the login page. Everytime I tried logging in it would just bounce back to the first page. I know my password and username are right and it didn't say that. Major glitch. I will find a different app to use.,
"This app is absolutely horrible. It's very slow and kids cannot learn from it if the navigation isn't kid friendly. It starts over in between letters and numbers. I paid for a year subscription and it takes the money off of your card without permission a year later. My daughter doesn't even use it. Unsatisfied, wish I could get my money back.",
This app is a waste of money and does not really help. Everything is just videos and ebooks. Clicked on math hoping to see some math problems for my child to do but it was all videos about numbers. Clicked on ABC's and it was all. ebooks about the alphabet. I was hoping it had ABC practice where kids can PRACTICE their abc's by maybe tracing letters or math problems where kids can do math problems like add or subtract. This was of no help to me!,
"I have seen such a huge difference in just 2 months that I have had abc mouse. We pronouncing and our speech is getting better. We are putting things together that we didn't before. I really really love this app. I strongly urge those parents who have little ones who are struggling to give it a try. I was once a skeptical on it, but did the free 30 days and said ok its worth it. Activities are good books are great. 5 stars from this mom. Thank you a.b.c mouse",
Absolutely love the app. Me and my wife seen the commercial years ago and decided to try it out for our 2 year old son.He is now 7 and we've had it ever since.I dont want to sound like a commercial but I really believe it taught him so many subjects as a stepping stone to being the top of his class every year at school.The only downside in my opinion is that theres not much to do once your child does get about 6 or 7 but we know use it for my niece and will continue to use it for our future kids,
App stopped at one lever and can't go any further if that is not done....so now is useless! I tought that it will be 30 days free trial and after the money will start to come out if I decide to keep it... but it actually takes the money in advance and if you want to cancel it is only possible after the membership period is over!,
It is very frustrating due to the coronavirus my daughter who just turned 5 has been put into ABCmouse which she loves and is very into but sadly I cannot get past anything because everything keeps freezing I do understand there's a high volume of children using this app at the moment but I can't continue to pay for something that she cannot use we get past a few things then it freezes up and it just buffers and buffers super frustrated!,
"The games are really fun! I like how you can learn and have fun, I also like that you can earn tickets, to buy all sorts of things, like clothes for your character, pets, toys, etc. But my favourite part about this app is the library, there's Disney books, Curious George, sweet books, etc. There's lots of fun songs to learn from. I think the learning path is pretty cool too, and this app can teach you things that you never knew before. I think kids would like this app like me and my sisters do!",
"i downloaded this app for my grandchildren. i planned on doing the 7 day free trial. i provided my credit card information and set up my account. i have yet to be able to open the app. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice and i still cannot sign in. at this point, I want to be able to log in and cancel my account. funny, i could get in to the app just enough to provide my information but cant get past the initial screen while it loads.",
Didn't really use it because it's super slow and takes forever to download and I don't think it offers as much as promised the bad part about it is that I this activated my settings so that they won't charge me another year and they just did without the authorization they just somehow alter the settings and they charged me again so now I have to pay another $60 for nothing,
"They have been charging 2 different credit cards for over a year and it's impossible to cancel it. all their content it's available for free in other sites, on top of that they use a very outdated platform.",
my little brother has a very hard time learning things kindergartners learn even though hes 8. i work with him to help and we made progress but he still has difficulties and argues like i dont know anything . i looked for learning apps for children and this popped up first. ive seen ads and it looks like it could really help almost anyone,
"It's an ok app. My son is in preschool, 75% done with the preschool portion and it's too easy for him so far. Its same 4 or 5 lessons over and over again hes getting bored with it.. The app is extremely slow. Thought it was our internet but no matter where we are it takes long to load. I wouldnt have paid the $45. I wish I waited past the trial date before paying that. We were excited about it. Oh well.",
I love this app. My son started kindergarten and had a speech problem. The teacher pulled me in a meeting one day and said they wanted to hold my son back. The school year wasnt up and they still had 3 semester if not 3 to go. Well I didn't agree so I brought this app and moved him to another school. My son is doing so much better. This app help me out so much and I'm very grateful to whoever created it. My son has learned much and enjoys playing the games. It makes learning easier and fun.,
I just purchased 12 months and the app is not working at all! I log in and the screen is loading and flips back and forth repeatedly and never logs me it. I am a very frustrated customer and would appreciate a response when this bug is corrected.,
My child loves this app. We've had it for over two years and plan on renewing our subscription for years to come. He has so much fun and has learned a lot. I like that it has a variety of activities for several areas of learning and that I can tailor the level of difficulty to my child's skill level.,
"takes to long to load activities, constantly freezes up, have to back out of the game and re start it to get it to work. This app should be free for how terribly it works i would rate it a zero if i could Still constantly freezes up and wont go to the next activity and absolutely disappointed in the app, will be deleting the app",
"I'm becoming infuriated over not being able to cancel my subscription. The website says I have to download the app to login (which I have to do in order to access the parent portal/cancel sub page). My phone won't download the app and every time I call, I get a recording saying they are closed due to a staff holiday. We haven't used abcmouse in months and have been charged almost $200. This is ridiculous. I'm tired of paying for NOTHING.",
"It used to be great. I bought it for my 4 year old and he used it until he started school. We repurchased it once our 3rd child was old enough to use it, but now it freezes up too many times to be worth using. I am giving it 1 more week before I cancel the membership and move onto a different program. I cannot recommend it to my Mom groups and classroom parents anymore until this issue is fixed.",
"The app won't allow me to log in. I contacted customer service to attempt to get the issue resolved, and instead of fixing the problem I was told to use a computer instead. Why have the app then?? I'm completely frustrated with this app and my customer service experience and I'd love a refund since this is now USELESS!",
Edit to add- we've already done that multiple times. It doesn't do anything. App just got reinstalled this morning before I made the review. It is completely up to date. Will not open on my tablet anymore. Works on laptop but just sits on the page with the yellow background on the tablet.,
Because of my location i cannot get ABC Mouse to work because of low cell signal therefore I canceled it but the payment continues to come out of my bank account and I cannot find where to contact anyone to correct this matter. Any help would be greatly appreciated. We have not been able to use the app so I have no basis to rate this app at all just couldn't post without rating it.,
"My biggest pet peeve is constantly having to email customer support to reset my son's learning level. He loves the app but I hate the inability to reset his level myself. The reset process is immensely annoying to me and frustrating for him. I know how to change the learning level but that doesn't let him re-do the first lesson, only the last three lessons, which defeats the purpose.",
"The app for the iPad, Mobile, and Desktop is horrible. I just made an account for my kids, and it tells me incorrect password or email. However, when I log in from the web browser, it works very well normal. You guys need to fix your apps, especially because I bought a yearly subs and other stuff. They don't work. And no, don't tell me to reset my password. My password works fine in the web browser. It's the apps. Great system, horrible applications.",
"Bought the promo on Facebook. Downloaded to 2 different Samsung devices. After logging in with the user name and password, all that happens is the blue and yellow screen flipping back and forth. I have uninstalled and installed it 4 different times at this point. I have 15 sec video to validate.",
"Heavily advertised at children. Neither of my kids like it. Waste of money. Mostly seems to be trying to teach Spanish at a time when my kids need to learn the basics of reading and writing English. I wouldn't mind some, but it's not helpful for that to be the man focus when my kids need to learn the basics and aren't going to learn them from this worthless program",
"I just downloaded and subscribed last night. My son wanted to play this morning and the app won't let us press or select ANYTHING! This is very disappointing. Especially since school is out for the rest of the year due to covid-19. This was supposed to help make learning fun, but he can't even use it.",
"Wonderful app for helping supplement your child's education (especially during these home-schooling times!) I would recommend using the pc version over the app as some of the learning games don't work quite right on the app, but it's still good for traveling use when you can't be near your computer!",
Its horrible to pay for something that keeps freezing. At the most it will give my child 15 minutes of learning time before it freezes. I have to keep restarting the app. and its not my phone for internet service because other apps do not do this.,
"Amazing. My little 2 year old is very very very high energy, I can't get her to sit and read books with me for more than a few minutes at a time. I have been finding it very hard to introduce certain things to her and this app has done wonders. She's totally engaged, loves the animals is already learning them and making the sounds. I am a very happy mom. I've only had it for a month, she doesn't really play the games but LOVES the e-books, it's already paid for itself in my opinion.",
"My son is two years old and I subscribed to ABC mouse to continue his education. The app and program is very useful and has a lot of clever techniques to help your children learn. Puzzles, videos, music, interaction, and more. My son cannot completely operate it by himself, but because he already knows his ABCs and number 1-10, I am expecting him to have a better grasp of the environment within the next couple months. I am also expecting for him to be reading in about 6 months from this app.",
I love the app. We have trouble with it freezing and repeating several lessons in a row without moving on. It also freezes when multiple children in the same house are on at once and i want to do it with my preschool next year.,
Great when it works. My 2 year old loves it though it's a very bugged app and barely works. Now it crashes and isn't working at all. Especially for a expensive child's learning app you would think its expertly made and updated. It doesn't work on tablets either.,
It's ok for smaller children. But the learning path gets repetitive and boring. They charge 9.99 and honestly I found the assessments helpful but there's an additional 3$ charge. My daughter loves the books. I canceled and plan to subscribe to epic.,
Just signed up for the free trial...was super excited to get my 4 year old started only to download the app and have it talk to me and not let me login at all. No amount of restarting or reinstalling seemed to solve the problem. Very disappointing... cancelling immediately.,
"I've never once opened this app and found everything in working order. I subscribed a few years ago and canceled because it didn't properly function on any device I had. Not my iPhone, my Mac, my hp, my samsung, my fire tablet, my galaxy tablet, nothing. Every device it wouldn't load or function properly. I just tried again, New Samsung galaxy 10e thinking that it's been a few years and maybe I just had bad luck last time. Nope. Even the offer video doesn't work. Not hunting another refund.",
Mouse is like a fun game that I love to play because it inspires me to keep on learning and have fun at the same time but it is challenging every once in awhile so I do get help a little bit and it takes breaks some little breaks and I just really like this being ABCmouse and it's an inspiring game that everyone should play because it's like good for every text even for babies they're really it's really fun and I just I love ABC Mouse.,
"Does not work with Samsung Tab E. Love the app, but crashes all the time. I might cancel my subscription if it can't get it fixed. It doesn't seem to matter which device I use, ABC mouse crashes! 3-24-2020",
"Great app! My two year old uses this on my touch screen computer and is able to perform the functions better on the app with touch screen than the browser with a mouse. He loves his ABC mouse time and always wants to do more. Even better, he is actually learning a lot. Highly reccomend!",
"It's okay. I liked it, it WAS fun. Until I realized you had to pay and we stopped paying. It's fun but it's No way near to paying you for money! You don't learn as my much for us to pay you! You should fix that. Anyway it's fun but nothing else is funner than the hamster game. I like to decorate my outfit but then my outfit was go default and I would lose it. So do some coding on that if you teach us to do coding maybe we need to help you code. So fix it please.",
They make it impossible to cancel. We no longer use it so I'm just throwing money away. I've given up several times because trying to cancel this is like getting a root canal. Downloaded the app so I could login and theres nothing to do so. Only trying to get you to sign up! Ugh!,
This app should help kids and they do love it. So I signed up again this time they offered me 1 month fo $12.99. For a month then I got a pop up for 6 months with a discount paid $29.99 for that. The yearly price is $59.99. So for 7 months I have been charged $42.98 because of the ads or pop ups they have when signing up. I gave also contacted customer service about this and the answer they gave me was you had they option to say no thanks. But they never disclosed they would keep charging you.,
Great!!!! My daughter has learned so much. I paid for a whole year and you wouldn't believe what she can do now plus she loves it!!! Recommended for all young children for sure and it also teaches separate for left handed and right handed and its great bc my daughter is a lefty and i had trouble teaching her things...5 starts!!!,
"Created an account (app or web doesn't allow password managers), op-ed to not do the trial because of their reputation (big mistake), using the same credentials the app doesn't login and ""forgot password"" link doesn't work. There are plenty of other learning systems that work, the company needs to fix their UX and technology, until then, avoid!!",
"If you have any problems there is no support, the 1 800 numbers goes to many difrent options but no good info or live person. Try contact by email goes to blank screen, also make sure to cancel or it renews without notification. One more thing it come with more games but when you download they are not free more $$ not impressed.",
"The game constantly glitches and lags. My 2 year old would get so frustrated. the other day he couldn't get it to work and threw our tablet and broke it. Mind you he's been playing on it for over a year, I have never seen him so frustrated before. I mean I might understand if it was a free app, but it's not.",
"It never loads! We paid for the year subscription and the darn thing freezes repeatedly, is slow to load and just doesn't work on my child's tablet or our laptop. The best device is a phone but 1) I'm not freely giving my child my phone because the app has no parental controls to keep her out of the other things on my phone and 2) a phone screen is just not practical for a toddler to try and navigate to play the games. Waste of money, but had potential for the parts that worked.",
"Too many steps to cancel. I absolutely swear and remember canceling this subscription from a computer. So sire, in fact, of that I deleted the app from 4 family devices. Still got charged. No luck on desktop, had to INSTALL AND UPDATE an app, then navigate through 2 password sections a 6 pages of this app to cancel. Shouldn't be this hard to stop spending money. The program and education is okay, not bad nor good. But this buffonery just makes me hate it all together.",
"So before getting this app, we used khan academy kids. It's okay, but we imagined that this app would be better. it's not, loading is longer. Some lessons lag intensely. We tried it on multiple devices and they all have this same problem. I don't normally leave bad reviews, but this would be bad, even for a free app.",
Hope you plan to keep your account forever because cancelling this subscription is the most difficult. And forget being able to speak to someone! My child hadn't used the app in 6 months or so and I forgot what email I registered with. So I decided to cancel the subscription. 4 months later I think I finally figured it out. Fingers crossed I'll know in a when the next billing cycle comes due. Guess it's my fault for paying with PayPal. Use a credit card at least that way you just cancel the card,
"ABC. Com is an awesome app for children to learn responsibility, explore, learn and have fun. You can have more than one child on this program, for the same low fee. Each child has a personalized learning path. My granddaughter loves when the app welcomes her back by her name.",
"Love the idea, but this just didn't work well for my 2.5 year old. The games were either way too simple or far too complex. Adding 3 numbers together for a child her age? Popping bubble games were too short, or buggy (corner bubbles didn't pop). They should focus on quality, not quantity. Cancelled.",
"I love it. I have only a few issues. Every once in a while it would get stuck. The book list has a lot of magic, fairies, wizards, monsters... too much for my taste. They teach evolution in almost everything as if it's fact, not as a theory and no intelligent design is taught which is more educationally sound as a theory. I don't like the use of too many monsters, wizards, and aliens. I do wish they had higher levels.",
Update. I have reached out and tried to fix the issue. Only one of my kids can do work at a time as I still can't access my account from this phone. I renewed my subscription online and went to long in and my app has been glitching since but everything else on my phone works just fine. Hate to pay for something that I can't use and my kids are off track with their school work.,
"Great app, just lacks response time. And loads slowly. It's frustrating/doubting for a kid when they select the answers and it's not recognizing it. Hope you fix this as it's concept is great! And also because it's a paid app not a free one!!!!",
"We bought this app in July to test it out but, my little one did not like it because, it would freeze up alot. I canceled the account and was still charged for August and September. They need better customer service instead of just emailing back and forth.",
I cancelled and unsubscribed but yet I'm still getting charged every month. I have spoken twice to customer service to have this issue stopped I am still being charged. It says to unsubscribe I need to log on but yet it won't let me log in and every time I try it crashes and says I do not have an account. Not worth it.,
"My grandson loves your games & videos. He's slightly hyper and it takes a lot to hold his attention. Your learning programs & games keep him occupied for up to 30 min. before he is off to another activity, which is pretty normal fovr an active four year old. But he comes back to play more games after his break. Definitely worth the money!",
"Impressive learning options to at least keep children mentally engaged in multiple subjects while out of school for an extended period of time. May not be perfect, but allows working parents to have some form of organized curriculum without essentially working as a part or fulltime teacher in addition to everything else required.",
No problems with the ABCMouse App or program. Fairly Happy customer. I only wonder about the Number Block puzzles. They number blocks do not appear in order nor do they go in order from like 1 to 20. My kindergardener was confused on which number came before which number after putting g the puzzles together. Took a while to undo. Problem corrected. It has been a good experience over all.,
"I installed this for my 2 yr old and didn't get past the first screen...bc you can't get past it without entering your credit card info for a ""free trial"" for 1 month. Someone else wrote they were charged $55 upfront bc they didn't read the fine print and that makes me uncomfortable. You guys should allow parents to see if it's worth the subscription for a short time (24hrs?) before having to enter financial details, then allow a free month trial. Uninstalled on principle.",
"Kids love it, we homeschool and it's a great tool to use to help my children learn while giving mom a short break! They want to play the games and do the work. It's easy to navigate, it's bright and colorful so kids are intrigued by it. Would recommend 100%",
"The app is functioning better now than it did before, but I have to say I am incredibly disappointed that the Mastering Math app is no longer included in the bundle. It was taken out of the bundle but the price of the bundle did not decrease. In fact, now Mastering Math is a separate app called My Math Academy with a separate subscription price that is more expensive than the ABC Mouse bundle price. Shame on you ABC Mouse. This is not a good business model.",
I signed up for the free trial and life as usual happens and I forgot to cancel the app when I finally remembered I emailed and asked to have the app canceled needless to say it wasn't . I have MS so my memory is challenged but 2 years later a they still billing me.... I think all TRIAL OFFERS should be required by law to send a reminder if you want to continue do nothing. If you don't select opt out!!,
So far this is a nightmare! I paid the yearly subscription and the app immediately froze. I reinstalled and it's so glitchy that I can't even sign back in to the app. It's not working! Worst app experience ever! I hope I can get my money back!,
"Had to lower my rating. My daughter loves the app but this last update ruined it . The accessibility settings cant be turned off and makes it impossible to do anything . This problem is on several different devices. As of 5/10 the problem is still happening, customer service has not responded to several attempts at getting help.",
In the beginning the app was good! Now the app kind of glitches some activities my child can't access and we end up opening and closing the app. I have been trying for weeks to cancel my subscription but when I follow the steps it will not allow me to click on my account and cancel.,
"There is a voice speaking like it's the program behind the program. It's over top of the actual app. The app freezes upon opening. Can not use. Uninstalled, reinstalled, reset my phone. Nothing works.",
Love the abcmouse program and really works for the kids but the Android app doesn't bring up the keyboard when I try to log in. *Update: Finally figured out there is a line at the bottom of my screen that I have to tap to pop up my keyboard to type in login info but try telling your toddler they can't have their abcmouse because I can't log in. App sometimes stalls too. Would be nice to have more offline options for the younger ones,
"I downloaded this app about a month ago to use for my children during the pandemic. The app worked very poorly and kept freezing during the account creation process. I eventually gave up, but it looks like an account was created despite that I received no confirmation because I was billed yesterday despite that I did not know I had an account and did not use it. I've heard good things about the service, but the app is of very poor quality.",
So hard to cancel.. my kids used this for a few months. Then lost interest. Then when trying to cancle the subscription the app makes it hard an confusing... I gave up a year ago and forgot to cancle it. Here we are a year later an they took money again. So I guess I'll spend another few hours trying to cancle again.,
"I agree with many others, this ""experience"" and app are so frustrating! It rarely works on my phone and the computer works even less! It's so buggy and constantly freezes. I would really like my money back!",
I love the the program but of lately the app is not working. I can't pass the login page. The desktop version is working great. You need to fix the app. I try logging in on my phone and on my tablet and it's the same. Cannot login. I can't be the only one having this issue.,
It works and seemed usefull but my son showed no interest so went to cancel subscription but ended up spending an extra $30 on an offer that showed up wile i was trying to cancel. now im out the $10 for basic subscription and the $30 for whatever offer it was that i didnt want. Thanks for taking my hard earned money win i was trying to cancel not get a different subscription. Why put an offer to get a better subscription on the cancelation page anyway?,
"I had a 1 year subscription to this when my kids were younger. This was a good program they just didn't want to sit down, they wanted outside to play! I wish there was an option to extend beyond just age 8. My kids are older and my 8yo will be 9 soon. School is harder for them and I can't find a program like this (even if it's adapted for 8 and up) for my kids at all. Please consider extending to parents like myself beyond 8 to maybe middle school. Their schools don't help",
Bad bad ap. Always freeze. Stock on one level. Keep replaying same level and won't pass. Follow letter a over and over again. Then this screen pop up after finishing. (open in browser button to click) (download app),
Terrible. doesn't work and it isn't useful. then it's like a 20 hour process to cancel your subscription and I'm doing that process for the 3rd time now. useless as they try to keep taking your money AND selling your info. pure trash. getting loads of contact and offering of assistance now that I've publicly talked about the low quality of both the app and the customer service,
"I'm not too much of a ""happy camper"" right now. The app has been running very slow since I downloaded it. It's taking more than one minute to load. I've turned my wifi on and off. I even hit the restart button on my phone more than three times. What seems to be going on with the connection?",
"I cancelled this app over a year ago.... Just received an email that abc mouse is trying to charge my card for a 1 year subscription. Can't get ahold of anyone to fix this! Ridiculous that a cancelled subscription doesn't mean a thing to these folks... Ridiculous that they continue to try to charge me for something I do not wish to use and do not use. My kids didn't like the app, but I was refused a refund ( two months after installing)... Had to eat the whole year smh.",
"Overly difficult to cancel. Couldn't do it on my phone browser, had to download the app. Then the app forces you into landscape mode which is HORRIBLE to navigate. Finally found the cancellation page. Shouldn't have to download this app to cancel my account.",
Trying to cancel subscription but having issues? Go to abcmouse online and at the bottom of page hit the chat icon. They'll try to guide you through troubleshooting. Just refuse and ask them to continue with cancelling... They will ask for last four numbers on card and then your done subscription cancelled...,
"my kids both LOVE this app. They are 2 and 5. They both got Alcatel 30 tablets for Christmas, and we have zero issues with the freezing and such others seem to have issues with. Also, although this app is designed for children, I am surprised at the amount of people complaining that their young children can't navigate the app alone. They aren't meant to navigate it alone at 2 or 4 years old. would you let them operate this on a desk top computer alone at those ages? GET INVOLVED.",
"As I'm trying to navigate through the app to get set up for my 4-year-old it is very difficult because I have to click and then double click on every letter just to log in, and then I haven't even completed step four of four to complete the process and get him started. so uninstalled and reinstalled this app and I'm still having a difficult time. I paid for it, and now I can't use it.",
"Fraud alert, canceled my subscription a year ago and they just billed me again. The app/service was not very good. My kids found most the games boring and uninviting. The UI was clunky and unrefined. My kids used it two or three times and didn't like it and honestly from what I saw I couldn't blame them. This company shares traits with the Washington Post, they won't let you cancel the subscription. But hey I'm sure it's just an accounting error right?",
"I have tried canceling this service for 9 straight months now. It has been a horrific experience! I have logged on and canceled through the portal as instructed and am still being charged. This product was not worth the hassle. RUN! They got at least 2 yrs of service from me. I've emailed support several times and I am not getting the help needed. They keep telling me how to log in and cxl. (Which doesn't work, idky) Going to the BBB and calling a lawyer tomorrow afternoon. Shame on you ABCmouse",
Website and App both dont work. I downloaded and tried to open the app. Initially it showed spme videos and i tried to sign up. But it keeps rejecting credit card payments. Then it stopped working all together. Even the website does not work so i dont know of any way of using this service.,
Honestly it's a great learning tool for my 3 and half year old who is starting school Monday but the app it's self is very slow the login process is glitching out and they won't put your email in you have to tap the letters multiple times to get a letter to pop up and it has a slow start up as well it takes a solid 2 minutes to load the start screen aslo i would like to see ABC mouse give report cards threw email to see where my child's strengths and weaknesses are in her learning.,
"Do not get caught in this gimmick. They will auto renew your account, charge you even after multiple cancellation requests, and account inactivity. Them tell not they can cancel your account but will not give a refund. I changed my card so I couldn't be charged but it made no difference, the charges kept coming. After months and months I finally got a reply to my emails and my account canceled, but no refund. I have now left it to the better business Bureau.",
I didn't get a notice that my subscription was renewing and got charged for the full years price. Had to update to view my account but unfortunately I have not been able to actually log back in because of some kind of Talk Back set up that has frozen the login page . Kind of angry here. Also will not allow me to email customer support. It overdrafted my account and now I can't even contact the company. What is going on?,
"my daughter loves it. the only issues I'm having now is that sometimes it freezes and my daughter has spent 200 tickets on a bed that we cannot find. all of the ""gifts"" she has earned or things she bought have disappeared and no one has responded to my email. the program does what it should but the lack of communication on something that you pay so much for is disappointing.",
"I had this and cancelled. Trying to sign up again and pay for the year, and it won't even take my money. Keeps telling me that I already have an account and to sign in. Nevermind! Seeing how parents are reporting the bad glitches and the slow downloads it probably just saved me 50 bucks. Too bad, my kids love playing it at the library. Wish they would put some money into making their program better.",
Increasingly glitchy and unstable. ABC Mouse is great...when it works. With every update it get less stable and even with a massively fast network connection and system both the desktop and mobile app cause more frustration than enjoyment these days.,
"Disappointed. This app only works on the cell phone when you download the app to a laptop or tablet. My child enjoys , the videos and games but my phone is necessary to access the app. Pages load very slowly which makes it difficult to use efficiently.",
The app doesn't even let you log in to use the app. It says to go online and login and set up your account come back and login. There is no login screen on the app. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times still does not work.,
I love ABC mouse and so do my kids! I purchased it for my son who is in kindergarten and not only does he love it so does my daughter who will start Pre-K later this year. The games are fun and engaging and I love the guided learning path and how it keeps up with how much the kids have learned. My son was struggling with reading and after only about 2 weeks I'm seeing improvement! I'm hoping what he's learned will be evident in this upcoming process report.,
I like the various activities for my 2 year old grand-daughter. What I do not like is the fact when I try to put this app on her tablet I run into problems such as it will not load correctly. I select forgot password to try to reset to sign in and it will not allow me to enter my password. Not happy because my grandbaby loves abc mouse and currently can only use on my phone. Please fix these bugs.,
"I've used this app since my girls were 2&3 they're 8&9 now and they love it. They like this better than bookwork fs! The whole setup is fun for them. It's cheap too! And there's different descounts and sales they have. Still we just ended up paying about $12/mo. for it. Im trying to see if there's a homeschool deal too? A lot of others cost us between $100&$200/kid (it's the SAME material!!) It's my girls last year using it, but I have six younger nephews ready to use it!",
"This app has not been helpful at all and we haven't used it for over a year now it has automatically renewed without having added any value for my child. Already paid amounts for it to not be helpful at all, the app is slow no matter which device it is used on. It is not value for money and I want my money refunded as I have tried so many times to cancel it however the app just keeps giving issues and now it was automatically charged. I am not happy at all with this app. I want my refund. There wasn't even an email to notify me of any upcoming renewal...this is highway robbery.",
It is one of the few programs as far as schooling that my son gets excited about. It helps him learning faster and more intently when doing the lessons with a child's role model. Love the program. Highly recommend.,
UPDATE: THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM AND WE ARE ABLE TO GET BACK TO LEARNING! IT IS BACK TO BEING AN AWESOME APP! THANK YOU ABC MOUSE! The learning path has stopped working. What is the point of having this app if my grandchild can't work on the learning path? I paid for a year and they were able to use it for like 6 months. Find something else that works don't waste ur money on this.,
"love this app! my son was so behind on his skills bc he wasn't interested. other learning have and apps just weren't enough. as soon as i got him on here, I've seen a big change. he's using more words, he knows all his alphabet and can identify them. counts to 20, knows shapes and colors! In just 2 short months of playing games he's already gotten 300% better.",
Terrible app. I paid for a 1 year membership but my child can't even use the program as it shuts off within 5 seconds and he is unable to do anything. It is very frustrating as he is unable to use a tablet or phone to access the program it's only available via the app yet the app NEVER works.,
"I really wanted to love this.. My mother in law found some ABCs songs from the ABC mouse's YouTube page and my daughter was OBSESSED. When we got the ABC mouse subscription, she hated it. We have been trying to make a reward system for her using it but it didn't help. We had the subscription for over a year. We haven't opened the app in months. It's time for us to put this to rest.",
Ever since we paid a ton to have access to this app we have regretted it. Half the time it won't even take our password. Or it freezes up and my kid can't play which is fun to deal with. And it starts out by asking us to join instead of just asking to login. So my kid always ends up on some screen that is asking her for cc info. There are plenty of free or much cheaper learning apps out there. Don't bother with this mess!,
"This app is bad. If i earned tickets, the next time i used the app they would be taken away. Just be careful with your tickets because mine always get taken away. I have been using this app when i was 5 years old but then after that with the ticket situation i didn't use it anymore. Other than that the app is very fun! You can do all kinds of fun games and activities. I liked how they put in fun in learning",
This app is so easy to use and so fun for my child and it has every subject you can find in a school and if you go to the grown up section you can time them on how long they work this is so easy now I don't have to drive her to school and she can do it on weekends too but it's is not very cool because you have to wait on the learning path even if you're in a higher grade already you have to stay in the same baby grade so I recommend you to get this app now if your kid misses it's not a problem,
"Edit: Warning! The app is different from the site! Many features not here. Cant trace her name. Faves on PC not on app. Can only fave games in your learning path. When I search for a game, tracing and trace one letter it doesnt return to letter select IT RETURNS BACK TO SEARCH. I do not want to search for the individual game each time? The slow loading we could deal with if my toddler didn't have to wait to SEARCH for it after each letter. Expect better for the price TRY BEBI TODDLERS INSTEAD!!",
We have used this app for a couple years now and have loved it but all of a sudden now since my kids have gotten a new tablet it won't let them in and keeps loosing their progress if and when they do get it. So they are having to start all over from the beginning every time. It is very frustrating to me and to them. Not only that but I can not sign in as a parent to fix the app on their tablet. I am about ready to delete this app and ask for a refund .,
"Ridiculous update, you guys should have considered that some of us got the yearly subscription. And now the app is not compatible with my device. I find that misleading? The app should be constructed to work and be compatible with all DEVICES. Many FAMILIES have invested in this app due to the affordability and all it has to offer. There is no reason I have to upgrade our DEVICES & spend more money to be compatible for your app when we already invested in it.",
"Stopped sending me emails when I canceled my subscription, but continued charging my husband's card. When I contacted them, they said they had no record of my cancellation, refunded one payment made the day before, and started emailing me again. If they didn't get my cancellation, why did they stop emailing me? Sadly, I was considering starting the subscription again because my toddler is a little older. But I can't support a company that takes advantage of busy parents.",
"Their is a better free app out there. Don't waste your money! Is quite unfortunate that I can't get what I paid for $80 CAN my kids gets frustrated when using this app. When they get so interested with an activity it Froze!!! And we can't go back to the main menu to choose a different activity It always direct to tap on the ""white board to continue on your current lessons"" and I don't know the particular lesson my daughter was on and whenever we click on it, is still Frozen for the past days now",
Have used this app off and on for years. It has always had issues. Yesterday kept closing out on my daughter. I've had issues of it getting stuck on one thing she's doing and not move on. Only reason I get the app is she is autistic and enjoys it here and there but when the app acts up it's hard to explain why she can't play.,
"This app wouldn't allow me to cancel it for months! No customer service, either. Do not waste your $$! You'll be locked into a monthly subscription for goodness knows how long! I've been paying for over 6 months for NO USE! I've emailed, called, everything to no avail! I don't have the extra $15 a month for this frivolous stuff.",
"I really wish I would have been told that I have to sign up to pay 10 dollars a month to use this in the first place I wasted a long time downloading this thinking it was free it didn't even say it had in app purchases I was really excited to show my son so that he could play educational games without any monthly payments too bad I was let down and you guys obviously only care for money instead of helping children advance their potential for learning. Maybe I'll pay to see it maybe not, not sure",
This app will not work on any android device I have! It works fine on chrome browser on our laptops. It's just a blank yellow screen on the app on my phone and tablet! Trying to contact coustomer service to figure it out. And of course I can use a browser on the tablet because it just tells me to use or install the app!,
"My daughter is 3 she loves ""schooltime"" ABC mouse is the best money I've spent in a while. She is so smart & ABC mouse helps with that a lot. She absolutely loves it. Definitely recommend this for any child. I have a nephew who is 1 month younger then my daughter & u can definitely tell the difference intelligence wise between the 2 I recommended it to my nephew's mom but she never did it. My daughter is gonna be so ready for school in 2 years! Definitely worth the money!",
"App doesn't allow 12 character long passwords. I have attempted to sign in several times. Website works, app doesn't allow me to type my last character. Update: After contacting chat support, they know of the app password limitations and instructed me to shorten my password. ""The reason is because that section only allows up to 10 characters""",
"Alhamdolillah the best app for kids' education I have found so far, and I download A TON of educational apps, even rewards children for completing lessons. Edit:The only thing I want to suggest however is that they should arrange the activities, videos and worksheets topicwise in a subject, it's too much hodgepodge of different topics which makes it difficult to navigate topicwise for child on his own, however the quality and depth of material is beyond, beyond, beyond amazing!!!",
Just paid for a subscription and its lagging and slow and freezing!!!! Totally frustrated They also keeps charging even though you cancel your subscription. I had to cancel and stop payment on my paypal.,
"Love the app, my son has already begun to excel in just a few short days on the app, and he loves getting to play on ABC mouse! The only thing is, it would be awesome to have some sort of app lock to keep your child in the ABC mouse app so I can keep him from backing out of it... He usually plays while I'm making our lunch and dinner, and I can't keep my eye on exactly what game he's playing on his tablet at the time...",
Don't subscribe! This company is fraudulent and will gain access to your bank account and withdrawal funds. Somehow they gained my new debit card information and withdrawals a years subscription from my account. No customer service number. You can send a message but you get the reply that they will get back with you in 24 to 48 hours which I highly doubt will happen. I wish I knew a way to report them to someone.,
"Your ad makes me want to claw my eyes and ears off. Also, it's ""maths,"" not ""math."" What, is there just one of it? Does that mean my kid gets taught how to misspell colour, favour and exercise? Totally inappropriate for use in Britain, especially considering the lack of quality in American education. I want my child to be able to infer meaning, for instance.",
"Parents - STAY AWAY!! Check the BBB (Better Business Bureau (Google search it for abcmouse bbb) on many others who have been scammed). They keep charging you even after cancelling. I've attempted to cancel 3 times. This week being the third attempt. Even though app says cancelled, they still charge my credit card monthly. Then they say their policy is not to give refunds. So if you dont notice for few months you are out of luck they wont return your money!",
"Doesn't open, the ""wheels"" just keep turning.Tried on my laptop, tablet, and phone and I have bell fibe internet so definitely the problem is not on my end. Just paid the annual fee but can't even use it. I log in and it just stops thereüòï Very disappointed! Added... March 2021..... And now that I haven't even used this app because it's so slow and frustrating to my children . You guys charge me another annual fee??? Stop charging me, I cancelled this last year! I want my money backüò†",
"A year ago, I subscribed (and canceled) to ABCmouse. My child absolutely hated it. She wanted nothing to do with it at all. So, even with a canceled subscription, what do they do? Charge my account. I've had issues with them in the past about this exact issue. I shouldn't have tried it, again.",
I payed the subscription for a year. What I wanted from the application was to teach and advanced my children in their reading and math. It is a great application that entertains my children while they learn social sciences and a little bit of both: math and reading. But I'm not 100% sure if they are really advancing as I wanted. My children have 7 and 8 years old.,
It teaches my daughter a lot but some of the time stuff doesn't work. For exampled she can't use the trace a letter/ number. It's frustrating. It has good qualities just wish they all worked.,
"Customer Service WOWS! I had an issue accessing my account and had a hard time doing a password reset and called customer service. I spoke with Dawn E. and she was able to get me back in via email password reset, give me a better subscription rate and also gave me 2 months retro active access for time I wasn't able to access my account. She was very pleasant to deal with and very helpful. Thanks ABC Mouse!!",
"Great!!! But...... This has a great concept, but it freezes up a lot!!! It may be due to my connection, but I've tried it on multiple connections, and still experienced the same situation.",
App is complete trash. Do not use the app AT ALL!!! Freezes and glitches like a mofo. My child would get so upset that she cant press anything or do anything without it effing up. I beyond upset about this stupid app. ****Added Edit**** I stand by my rating. No one wants to have to uninstall and reinstall a app that will keep on not working no matter if it has been uninstalled and reinstalled. Apps update themselves and so does my smart phone. I have the latest version of all the softwares.,
Absolutely love this app helps my 2 year old learn more. Although I do wish there was more for preschool age lessons to learn. As well as for them to expand this to all school ages. I do believe my older children could benefit from this app and do better in school if they expand it to there all school ages.,
"This is a great learning tool when used on the computer! The app would be great, but it doesn't let you log in! The screen doesn't fit the phone and you can't click the area to enter your information. Will update my rating if it can be fixed.",
"Super laggy old trash servers. Every button press takes 10 seconds, regardless of device or connection speed. I tried it on tablets on 4G. Phones wifi even Android x86 on a wired PC. It 100% abcmouse lack of current hardware. If they don't want to invest in themselves why should I?",
"Freezes a lot!! Great fun for my 4 year old. But some videos definitely forces the THEORY of evolution on kids rather than leaving that out. Fyi, its it's definitely not a proven theory.. it has not passed the scientific method, look it up. Anyways, leave that kind of stuff to public schools where there's no choice on what they poison kids with. This should strictly be for math, reading, and provable, and basic science.",
Used to be a great app but since they started removing all the good content and creating new apps that you need to pay extra for I cannot recommend. My Math Academy used to be integrated into Abcmouse and was the main reason my child used the app but now I'm asked to pay extra for this content. Looks like some of the good reading content is about to go the same way. Very disappointing.,
"*Update* So the app messed up on me a few times. I would get everything set up and my daughter would start using it and get tickets then it would mess up. The last time it wouldn't even let her use the learning path and it would freeze trying to get to it. Closing the app didn't work so i restarted my phone. Restarting my phone fixed everything, but she lost a lot of tickets in the process of trying to figure out what was going on. After fixing it and restarting the phone is works just fine.",
"Waste of money. App is full of glitches and will freeze and crash multiple times daily. I have tried on Android, Apple, and desktop devices and it makes no difference. Wish I would have listened to other reviews that said the same before purchasing!",
The app works relatively well but sometimes it loads and loads until we have to restart the app. If I could make one suggestion it would be a lock button inside the app so your child can't accidentally open other apps or close it out entirely.,
"My 3 yr old loves this app. It is often the first thing she want to do when she wakes up. I enjoy watching as she learns and sings along with the songs. It has given me a place to start testing what she has learned with asking colors, letters or numbers.",
"Recommended!!! I have two daughters, Willow is 3 yo and Novah is four and a half years old. Because of the Coronavirus, this is a great substitute for pre-k so they are ahead of the game when schools reopen since my 4 year old maybe going straight into kindergarten it makes it a fun alternative to a homeschool and they have a parent assessment book so each of the child's progress is very easy to check. The first month is free once you sign up with ABCmouse!",
"It is useless... I wish there was a way to give this application less than one star; it doesn't deserve one. Worked for a few days, started crashing, all system, apps, security software and device updates are complete and current. Tech/Customer support is an absolute joke. Email support options only, canned responses about my browser being out of date when I plainly stated that the app was installed on an Android Tablet NOT a PC. Requests for a refund ignored. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.",
App just stopped working? We have been using it a lot lately with little problem it's glitchy sometimes. Now I can't even get it to work? I tried my iPhone as well and nothing. We use an android gizmo tablet as well. Get it together ABC Mouse. Support ALL devices.,
Awesome app for little ones. My 2 year old really enjoy's the interactive aspects as do I. However I am not too crazy about how it tends to lag a bit taking a while to load activities. Overall I would recommend ABC Mouse to anyone who not only wants thier child to enjoy learning but wants to ensure it keeps them challenged.,
"The worst. ABC mouse is a wonderful teaching aid. But, for the price, the apps should work and they very rarely do. They're also not functional across all platforms. It's just terrible...",
There are a few bug issues. Sometimes it freezes and kicks the kids out. But other than that the subscription was well worth my money. My kids are learning so much and ask to play it all the time! Warms my heart to see an education engine bring so much joy and wanting to learn to my home and family.,
ALWAYS LOADING! I downloaded the app when it suggested it on my tablet and as my child did the activities every time we would go beyond the little advertised activity the little displayed icon she gets never gets the question never gets the next question or something it's always loading because of some reason it's not the Wi-Fi it's not unstable it's not anything as far as the network it's the dang app! Children can't learn if they can't reach the activity!,
Worst website and app I have ever used. It does not work on a pc as it still uses Adobe Flash (which has been obsolete for 10 years). The app is just as bad working half the time. It frustrates my daughter because of the user experience. AbcYa is similar and the experience is 1000% better.,
"The app has a lot of great, educational activities for kids... HOWEVER, it runs sooo slow that it isn't worth the wait. More than half the time is just waiting for activities to load! Also, you have no control over the activities your kid chooses, so kids just go straight to the TV shows section of the app and avoid all the educational activities. That's a shame because you should be able to choose what activities your kids can do instead of having to monitor them the entire time.",
"My daughter actually likes using the app. But ABC mouse had smaller apps to work on specific things. Mastering Math with Shapey's was her favorite of them all. However the main app supposedly ""absorbed"" the smaller apps. However can't find it anywhere. If it is on the main app I wish I could get some guidance on how to find it! Send help!!",
"I signed up for ABCmouse for my 5 year old. He will be going into kindergarden this fall, and i wanted to find a fun program that could help him get ready. ABCmouse has more depth than i could have ever imagined, with countless games, stories, and activities. We have only been using it for a few weeks and his abitlity to identify and use letters and numbers correctly has improved tremendously. I will continue to use this program for him and i would highly recomend to anyone else.",
"The app cannot load anything for over a month now. It keeps on indicating that I'm offline despite having made the payment for a year and my kids having used it for a few months now. This is frustrating, especially to the little one who enjoys the app the post. We are a frustrated lot and I doubt I'll spend the cash on another subscription.",
"Can't get pass the login screen on the app, for my kid's tablet. Edit to add. I have reached out to costumer service. I didn't receive any information that was actually helpful. The response I got was in reference to schools closing and superintendents needed to approve free subscriptions. But I paid for our subscription, so that didn't apply to us.",
"I cancelled my free trial subscription within the time period and they processed an unauthorized charge to my PayPal anyway.It clearly stated that I wouldn't be charged if i cancelled within the given trial period time in both the welcome email and my subscription cancellation email.I never even used the app once during the entire trial time, and yet they're still trying to charge me for part of the service although I cancelled the entire service.What a rip off for a children's app! DO NOT USE!!",
My girls liked this app but sometimes it's very slow to load and they get over it. I've been trying to cancel for months! They keep charging me and will not cancel!!!! There's a bunch of other options out there that are not over priced!,
Terrible user interface. Even worse when editing account billing information and cancelation. This is an app/website made for the early 2000's. A 90's tamagotchi toy has a better user experience. My TI-89 calculator from highschool has better user controls. My grandfather's thermostat in his 1940's house is faster than this app/website. I can't remember the last time I waited this long for games to load. Oregon Trail is more responsive than playing any of this content.,
Horrible customer service. They all keep telling you to do the same thing. Yet no one wants to reply when you ask for your yearly subscription money back because you cant even use the app. With everything updated and tried on different devices it's still not working. Yet I keep seeing commercials and advertisements everywhere for it. Just makes me even more mad. I just want my money back.,
"I didnt receive any emails, but the 1st refund is processing now. I will suggest to everybody else to have your card completely cancelled through your bank after clearing your card and account information. Since this seems to be reoccurring issue. Keep your screenshots and emails. Depending on your bank you can also block withdraws.üôÖ Thank you for fixing half of the problem, hope that I won't have to deal with this again next year.",
"I have been trying to cancel my subscription for 3 months. I have called, attempted to download the app to cancel & more. I do not use it & neither does my daughter for my grands. You always have a high call volume so i am never able to speak with anyone & the app download remains stuck on 8% downloaded.",
"ABC Mouse is truly amazing. My son is learning quickly because all the lessons are made into different activities which keeps him interested. ABC Mouse is best teaching app for all ages, I was happy to see that they start at a toddler level and up because my son is 3yrs old and he is learning things quickly.",
"The app shrinks during the sign up process. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times, It still srinks to a quarter of the screen. We can't read, nor type on the tiny boxes avalible.",
My 2 year old has fun with the app but she loses interest really quick due to the super slow loading. The app also freezes constantly or wont load videos all together. I am hoping this issue will clear up otherwise I wont be continuing past the free trial.,
the app wouldn't load. I downloaded and deleted 4 times. then couldn't cancel. couldn't find a support contact. then when I got charged and tried that number that came with the notice. no one answers and got hung up on 2. dont do anything with this app. it's just a scam.,
I've been trying to cancel since I started because I dont like the app or any of the layout of it. I tried and tried to email customer service to take my paypal off and it wont let me! Ugh still charges my paypal every month I can't get rid of it. Please do no purchase app you WILL NOT GET AWAY FROM IT. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!,
This was great 2 years ago. My child lost interest and now wanted to try again. It's like they stopped caring about everything. Worst app and customer service I have experienced in 2022 by far. After signing up for trial $5 month I could not get the app to work on anything. Customer service said too bad. Then basically told me I was cheap for asking for a refund. What a joke they are.,
"I have no idea how, but I just found out yesterday they have been fraudulently charging my bank account for $25 the last two months. They wont stop or cancel the subscription, and the charges are not linked to my google acct that is the only place my card was ever used. I never signed up for this and they are unapologetically stealing from me to the point I had to cancel my current debit card for a new one. I would never trust a company this financially irresponsible.",
I started ABC Mouse with my two year old a week ago to work on his talking and I have already noticed a difference! My son is very independent and likes to do things when he pleases; talking is no exception to this rule. I wanted something that'd get him interested in communicating verbally that was more effective than me asking him if he can say this or say that. After just the first day using it he wanted to do it all the time and now even brings me the iPad. He's even begun talking more!,
I have used several different apps for my kids and ABC Mouse has definitely been the best so far. It holds their interest better than other apps and the content is perfect for the age / grade levels you choose.,
Got this for my son. He loves it. Payed monthly then decided to pay for a year but the app is not working for me anymore. There is nothing I can do about it I've tried to uninstall then reinstall but didn't help. I get stuck on a blue and yellow screen that flashes back and forth. Very disappointing. Now it's just a waste of money. Would give a 5 star if this can be fixed,
"Do not ever give ABC Mouse your credit card info. We canceled them 2 yrs ago after a couple of months, deleted the app. Then they started charging us about a yr later, which we went through a hellish process trying to cancel without having anymore log in info. NOW almost 2 years later they are charging us again! They kept on asking us to log in, but we no longer have the info. We have No numbers to call and the emails to them kept in getting sent back. They also blocked me on fb for commenting.",
Subscribed for a year and for a free month trial and my daughters wanted nothing to do with it thankfully they still refunded my money even though they don't usually do that for subscriptions like that. One of my daughters has autism and I thought this might help her learn but she's stubborn about what she gets on. And my other daughter is a sponge when it comes to learning but she didn't care much for this app either. This might be a great app for other kids though. Just be careful.,
I would like to give this a better rating because my daughter was enjoying playong and learning but again we are having trouble with popping the dang balloons. My daughter can't move forward on the learning path because she can't pop all the balloons. She had been at the same spot all week. If I would have known I would have this many problems I wouldn't have spent my money on this subscription.,
The content is great but the app is not functioning normally. My child got frustrated because the app stopped responding. Cannot click after the welcome screen. I closed and opened again many times but it didnot fix the problem. It works sometimes and sometimes doesn't. So I'm not sure why.,
"I bought the year subscription for my boys. They enjoy the lessons (and their goldfish, tickets earned etc.) however the app is horrble. It freezes it lags and can be difficult to navigate as if the developer was confused on his ideal path for this app. Luckily there are up and coming alternatives to abcmousefor us parents to further emerse our children in education beyond the classroom.",
Abc Mouse has helped my daughter academically in school and at home. She has difficulties reading and this app has done wonders for her. The only issue we have had is finding the shapes and the app doesn't recognize when we search for shapes under math. Please help if you can. Thank you. :),
"This is the best app available for the kids, I personally loved the content. Every game, book, activity is very well thought of. What botthers me is the glitchs and slowspeed of the app. I want my daughter to stick to this app because of its creative content. But due to the glitchs she switchs to other apps. I would suggest developers to work on glitchs and speed.",
"App freezes A LOT ! Or simply will not load . Should definitely make an update to it because it is VERY frustrating . Spent about $69 a year on this so my son could learn while I am working from home and he doesn't have access to my computer while I work so I figure this would be great for his tablet . It doesn't work on his tablet because it freezes or just simply won't load, so I put it on my phone and yup does the same thing . Looks like I am not the only one with this issue . Not happy.",
Good untill your kid outgrows this and you try to cancel. I have paid for this app for 7 years. The last year I was unaware I was being charged because the cancel process does not work unless you contact them to do it. So i paid 12.99 each months for a year and noticed on my paypal they kept charging me. I called in for help and was instructed to cancel with directions. I followed those and still was not cancelled and I'm not entirely should if they now canceled me or not but I blocked them.,
I started this app with my 2yr old and my 9m old. Now they are 5yrs and 3yrs. And I am absolutely amazing at how quickly they have learned. My 5 yr old reads at a 1st grade level before starting kindergarten. My 3yr old can recognize letter sounds and have started to sound out words! I would recommend Abc mouse to every parent I know. Our family loves it!,
"Such a GREAT educational app.. it eases the transition for little ones into PT or FT curriculum! Whether in person or at home & everything in between! The kids ALL LOVE IT once they try it out! On their own or with a parent even once, so they start navigating themselves through it! I highly reccomend! This is my second child to use it. Years ago this program gave my daughter the confidence & tools needed to become accepted into advance reading & to this day. Onto the 2nd kid! Thank you ABCMouse!",
I'm going to put this simply. My kids are not interested in this app. I've tried different activities with them to help prep them for school an early start. My daughter only listens to the videos and my son is not interested in anything except the pet hamsters and aquarium. The load times for this app is ridiculous slow.,
"Frustrating. Every time I start up the ap. It takes way too long to load up. I have to stare at the mouse logo for 10 minutes. If not longer. I always have to uninstall the app, and reinstall it to let my daughter use it. Getting ridiculous if you ask me.",
"I want to love it, but I can't It is often slow I need this to help me continue my child's schooling at home, but I can't put the code in anywhere. I can't remember my password and have requested it twice, but no email has been sent yet. I'm hoping to give it more stars later because at the core the learning aspects are really engaging. Also can't log in through clever on a tablet or smart phone.",
"Great App. My 6 year old daughter has been using ABC mouse for over a year now and she loves it. It is really educational and informative, with lots of variety and fun. The only request I would make is for more information on different contries - it is clearly American and very much focused on American information. My daughter knows a lot about Amerca even though she is British. That said, we find it great and will certainly continue using it. Thank you :).",
This is a nice app my son would use this all the time. However I was upset that he didn't receive his full time on the app I got an email that it would expire on sep 1 but it kicked him out a whole two months in half before tha expire date. Then today I get an email saying it expired. But you guys ended it way before that. I contacted customer service with no reply. Even tho he loves this app I may not do it again if were not going to get a full subscription as promised.,
"My 4yo's initial reaction to seeing the app was: ""this is so cool!"" which is the reaction that any parent would want to hear about an educational app. But in the HTC phone that we have (a spare) it took forever to load. do i installed it on my S8. it ran quicker but it would lock up. salt i don't think I'll be able to use the app and I'll just need to let her use it on my laptop or the computer at home though the web site. I'll check later to see if there's a Windows based apo and how it perform",
Use to be good but now the app login goes to a small box doesn't even flip the view to fit my screen so it's all zoomed in so it doesn't even let me click on anything so I can't even login! Been trying to cancel the subscription for the longest but it keeps telling me I have to do it through the app the app which doesn't log me in so I been getting charged every month on something we haven't been Nor can't use,
The app won't even work now. Every time I go to click on something the app just force closes. This has been an issue for the past 2 weeks. I've Uninstalled and re-installed 47 freaking times.,
My children have used this app since they were toddlers. They are now upper elementary students. ABC Mouse gave them a great foundation before they entered preschool AND we still use it today! My eldest child has moved on to Adventure Academy which is for older children and he loves it. The other children are excited to move up as well! I am a teacher by profession so I highly recommend this app to my students/parents. I wanted nothing but the best for my children and ABC Mouse is THE BEST!,
"I want to love it! Unfortunately we can't get the app to load on my child's tablet. I contacted support and received a canned, unhelpful response. I then contacted support again for a refund and was told to contact Google Play. Google Play's policy says to contact developer! It's now been months and I'm being charged for an educational app we cannot use.",
"This app will not load completely. I have tried on my IPad, and on my android phone. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times. You cannot access the website directly as the site automatically redirects you to their app download site.",
"After getting a yearly subscription I found that there are only three children per. I wanted this for my grand children so I need more than that, even just one more would have been helpful since two out of six are newborn and don't need it yet. The oldest four are 2 thru 8 UPDATE: Thank you so much for helping me with getting enough avatars for my grandchildren. Your response was quick and I appreciate that very much! :) I highly recommend this app to anyone with young children or grandchildren",
"We canceled this month's ago and just got charged again. Tried to go online and nooo you have to download the app to login... really?! So I do that, nope, not cancelled apparently... Just cancelled, again, hopefully. Tried to take a screenshot of my cancelation. Nope, can't do that either because of ""security policy"". What on earth is private about a confirmation with NO personal info on it. Goodnes gracious. Will not be back to this app even when we can afford it again.",
"This App was unusable for almost the entirety of over a year. It renewed, so I gave it another shot and it was a complete waste of money. Try a different learning app. I do not recommend ABC mouse. Issues on Android phone and Android tablet.",
"Do not download this app. I started using it for my little sister in 2017 and it was fine. Then in 2018 they took my money but she could access the app anymore. Now 2 years after that i have to keep my cc maxed out to avoid the $60 charge to my card. When i sign in to try to cancel it only allows me the option to pay them while saying ""welcome back!"" My card cant block them until they take my money and they have no phone support so canceling means changing your card number thats the only way.",
"Terrible, does not load...when this first came out and tried it it was terrible nothing was loading. Now I am trying again with my younger ones and its worst. Most of the time the content would not load. Little kids don't have patience to sit and wait 5 to 10 mins for something to load. I am cancelling the membership now. I even tried it on different devices. Not working...",
Just started using the app 2 weeks ago. While I do like parts of this app it is slow. I thought it was just my tablet but its slow on my phone also. You can see how this would be a problem with little ones who hit 3 buttons before the first one loads. I am going to give it a month.,
I wish i could rate it but i got as far as putting my credit card info and then it went to a slim screen where i cant do anything. It almost look like its designed for a phone. This is so frustrating!,
"The app is great if and when it works properly. For an app that you pay for, it should have the bugs worked out. The app freezes often. Then just stops working. Do we get a credit for the app not working correctly and becomes unusable?",
I accidently chose the wrong option and ended up getting charged for the app versus the free trial. I contacted the customer service team and they were fast to respond and helpful. Thanks so much.,
In the past the app has been great on mobile or laptop. However the last couple times my son has tried to use it he gets one thing done then it crashes or freezes. Last time we attempted to use it (couple days ago)my son played about five minutes then it went to a 504error screen and would not reload.,
"All three of my kids play -- though we recently upgraded my 6-yo to Adventure Academy. The 6-yo was getting a little bored with the content, but she still checks on her pets in ABCmouse occasionally. My 3.5 yo and almost 2yo love love love this app -- it's perfectly age appropriate for them. We have it on about 5 different devices (Samsung Galaxy Tab, Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPad, and Samsung Galaxy S9) -- it works well on every single device.",
"This app is not working properly. If you trust them and enter your credit card info, there is no way to cancel your subscription since app is not working and support team will never response to you. I ended up with changing my credit card completely to get rid of this scam",
"Frustrated because I was going to keep the app after my free trial, until every week I was being charged 75 cents. Now I've been trying to cancel and I was billed 9.95 on November 20th and December 2nd. The learning portion of this app is fine however its just the billing.",
"This has been so helpful during quarantine. My daughter is on track and even advanced in reading! While she did all of her distance learning work from school, we still had a lot of down time. She chooses ABCmouse over TV time and I love it!!",
My 3 and 4 year old loves the app. Their favorite is coloring amd the songs. I like the fact that anything and everything they do is educational and not just nonsense on a screen. Highly recommend!,
Trash!!! It lags terribly. You can't even get a human being on the phone to help with issues. I've been on three separate devices trying to cancel this and be fully refunded. I can't even get in touch with a human being. This is ridiculous!! I'd give it zero stars if I could.,
This app continues to frustrate me and my kids. We try to use it once a day. Every single time one of my children will get to an activity on the learning path that refuses to load. One of my children has been stuck on the same activity for two days now because it will not load. When this happens she can't continue on the learning path at all and her progress stops. ABC Mouse has had more than enough time to figure out the increase in users. It's awful that we are STILL dealing with this!,
"My kids have been using ABC mouse for several years now and we love ABC mouse. I've tried other educational apps and none of those were as good as ABC mouse. I've even recently downloaded the Adventure Academy for my 7 year old and he loves it! My two year old asks to play ABC mouse almost daily. It`s definitely worth the money if you're looking to find something to help your kids with their education. The math videos and games have really helped my son who struggles in math.Thanks,ABC Mouse",
"Abc mouse is awesome and helps my daughter learn to the best of her ability. My 3 yr old learned a-z, counting things to over 20, number sign recognition, shapes, memory match, and plenty more. If my hyperactive 3yr old daughter can learn this much from a single app so can yours. You will not regret it!",
"Best app for kids I'm never uninstalling from my phone or cancelling mem. My daughter teaches me things I didn't know, like the statue of liberty being painted in copper, I always thought they just painted it green, and her vocabulary she'll say stuff like visualize, effect, so many others she's only 5, and it's amazing.",
"Soo I started a new subscription months ago on my childs Samsung Galaxy tablet for my 3 & 5yr olds, BUT it stays on the yellow screen with the ABCmouse logo! Now its been a few months and it doesnt load to the classroom! I can't even cancel my subscription because I can't get into the app! This app would be great if it worked. Edit***Thank you! I did get too unsubscribe. I do think its a great leaning app when it would load! Gave another rating based on the app!",
Inoperable on my kindle fire and have uninstalled and reinstalled like suggested. When downloading the app on my phone it stays stuck at 70% and gives me trouble launching. This app needs a lot of improvements across many devices.,
I thought it was my phone. But after reading the other reviews I know it's the app.. might daughter hasn't even been able to start the lessons. It never loads. Ive restarted my device three times already. Please fix this. Free apps at least let her start the lessons.,
I downloaded this app because schools closed bc of COVID-19. This lockdown happened right after i was told my daughter had a extremely short attention span where she couldnt focus to do work. No matter how hard we tried to get her to blend her sounds she couldnt get the concept of blending letters to create words even though she could sound out all her letters. I downloaded this app so i could help her get ready for 1st gr. This app has helped her to read so many words now in less than two weeks,
"I love this app for my children but you think they would have fixed the issues regarding using a Samsung tablet... I'm Obviously going to have to cancel my plan, all it does is freeze, load, say incorrect password (for parent zone) because it will not let me type in the rest... or it just quits all together... Again love the app, Love the benefit for my kids but because of this one issue that they have had for years, they will be losing another client.",
Trying to download the app on multiple devices and gets to 70% then stops. I signed up online and put payment info for after the 30 day free trial and was directed to download the app. My daughter really would love to try this and can't and I don't want to be charged for something we can't use!,
"PROS: Lots of content; Engaging activities once started; Fairly useful assessments (cost extra) CONS: Recurring cost; Dashboard/menus - busy & distracting, hard to steer child to learning path or lessons; No offline play; Buggy - periodic freezes and crashes, frustrating; TV?! - now that TV is featured content my child ignores the rest, should NOT be in main app. OVERALL: Worth a trial, perhaps not a subscription. Consider (free) Khan Academy Kids instead.",
"It is too glitchy gets stuck and cant proceed on the path and i told them about this they gave me my money back hence the star but they just took 9.95 off my card and i cant get into the app to let them know,also customer service is not open,NOT Good. Wish it was different seemed like a good app,if people would do there job and when you give someone money back take off the automatic payments. Thanks",
I have not had ABC Mouse App on any of our devices in a number of years. I had cancelled our subscription a couple of years or so back. All of a sudden I noticed we were getting charged a monthly subscription for ABC mouse. I went back in our bank records and it shows they started drafting from our account back in June! I have asked for our money back starting from when it started to be drafter from our account without authorization! Getting a hold of anyone at this place is a joke!!!,
"I downloaded the app filled in all info put in my credit card detaills keeps saying declined . went to support with no Email to contact just frequent questions with answers which did not help as it's still not going through . Never had so much issues with a subcription, especially when I'm going to pay for one . it should be a easy process.",
The app freezes constantly. Have installed and reinstalled numerous times. Same issue. They still have not fixed the issue. I will cancel my subscription. It seems they dont care in fixing the issue.,
"I was seriously considering getting this app for my daughter but after reading all the technical and billing difficulties people are having, I'd rather not take the chance. I'm pretty dissapointed because it's a good program.",
"My son loves this app, but it stopped working months ago! I sent an email and was told it was a ""known problem"" and they were working on it. Our subscription has run out but I'm not going to renew until the app works. Right now we can't even type on the log-in screen. Very disappointing.",
Kids absolutely adore this app. Is a must have for young kids during Quarantine! Easy to navigate for even my 1yo. Really helps kids move ahead in the learning curve of things! Plus teaches them how to navigate a phone or computer. LOVE!,
It's a great app which inspires my child to learn. However some games should be longer. I also don't see where it's flexible to start at one point opposed to another.,
"I have been writing to them for days, they keep saying the same two things - send a message and we will look into it or the latest one is it's been fixed - IT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED!!!! This has been going on since I paid for a year subscription on March 23, 2020. I can't even get my money back, keep asking for a way to do that as well, but they don't give any response to that at all!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!",
"Takes your payment details quick and efficiently then the app does not load. Looking down through the other reviews it appears I am not the only one with this issue. Company seems to be blaming the users devices/android systems for the issue, however I have a new android device and 5G so my device is not the issue. I had no issue signing up and entering my payment details. ¬£0.85 has already been debited from my bank, I'm now concerned the subscription fee will be debited for nothing in return.",
Love the site but the app won't even load,
I wasn't sure if this was just hype on t.v. but so far my 3 year old has learned a lot and actually likes to play on this app. We do 3 activities and 3 videos before bed every night.. tonight we learned about gravity and magnets! I paid $60 for the year and I do NOT regret it. I recommend all parents of small children get this. It's worth the investment and it comes with offline apps too so you can learn with or without internet.,
this app has been an absolute life changer. its worth every penny spent!! i would definitely recommend getting this app if you have child that struggles in school or is unmotivated. this will change everything. great job devs!!! it is very engaging even enough to keep my 2 boys with ADHD engaged for and wanting to learn more.,
"I already rated this app 1 star. IDK why it's asking me to rate again. I absolutely hate this app. And BTW, they charge $14 per month, not the $9.95 they advertise. They don't have customer service, if you send an email, you will get automatic replies back which aren't helpful. I've contacted them to cancel my subscription, and all they suggest is going into the app to cancel. I can't get the stupid app to work on my phone or tablet, yet they keep snatching $14 out of my account.",
"App was great when we used it, but the kids lost interest very quickly. I forgot about it, and realized it was time for me to cancel the subscription. Tried to cancel using the browser and it's making me download the app again, which is a hassle on its own.",
"This app is a rip off!!! I paid for a whole year and Nothing! The app does not work. It shows up in a small screen in the on my computer and it dont even allow me to log in. In saying that i cant even get onto to cancel it. So ill have to contact my card holder and cancel it and than report this app as spam and the business to the (bbb). Saddly disappointed, this app is just a scam",
"says its a free app, but its only free for 30 days, then you have to""pay a monthly fee. NOT A FREE APP. update - I would delete the low rating if advertising were changed to indicate it is a free trial app, not a free app. Calling it a free app is misleading.",
"this is a very expensive program that my children do not like. It doesnt capture or hold their attention for more then a few minutes, there is no real progression to their learning and the app file is so large that it clogs up everything on my phone. I do not recommend this app if you have an even remotely intelligent child.",
"ABC mouse is a great app that truly does help kids learn. One major flaw though, it integrates english and spanish. There is an option for which language you want. But under english, there are courses for learning Spanish. My child is 4 and autistic. He already has a hard enough time, now he tries saying words in Spanish where his mother and I are unable to understand his needs. Please fix this ABC mouse. If I want another language to be taught to my child, i will decide that",
"For how expensive this is, the app really underwhelms. Been paying for this for about 2 years now and using it very sparingly. Basically throwing money away, so recently been trying to use this more with the kids. In the last 12 attempts to use this app, it has failed 12 times. Each one of these times the app completely stops and says we are offline. We are definitely not offline. I can guarantee its not my network. This app on android phones sucks. I'm using it(TRYING TO)on a Pixel 3 XL.",
"Quite upset at the moment. Don't get me wrong, the games itself are quite good. But the uploading between each section took too long. Which my daughter totally lost interest. But what has upset me now is that over a month ago I uninstalled it and I'm still getting charged for another month without having it installed. Please, I need to be reimbursed. Christmas is around the corner and I don't want to be charged anymore. Please stop",
"My son is starting to come back to us after his traumatic brain injury and abcmouse is very helpful in this journey. However, yesterday, my son saw 2 boys kissing on the lips on abcmouse. We do not accept this in my household and don't feel it is appropriate on an educational app focused on young children. Will not be continuing the subscription after this month. üíî",
"I would give this app 5 stars since my daughter loves it! Yet, the app itself freezes on my daughter's tablet (Amazon Fire Kindle) and the other apps that are free with our subscription that go with it are not compatible with her tablet but they can go on mine. The abc mouse app is not compatible with my tablet (precision elite) but compatible with hers. The only device we have where all apps are compatible and actually work is my phone.",
"INCREDIBLY DECEPTIVE!!! Wanted to get this for my kids, it offers a ""free"" one month trial. Like all ""free"" trials they want your credit card info upfront for their $9.95 a month program thats supposed to take effect after the first 30 days. After you enter all your payment info and select your program... if you look at the fine print at the bottom it says there actually just gonna charge you $55 upfront the first day. NO FREE TRIAL. And they arent even forthcoming with it. Total scam.",
"I bought the annual subscription for my 3 year old son, and now I can not even get past the login page. I have tried to troubleshoot it several times, updated my computer and phone, even reset all of the technology that will be used and nothing has worked. I feel as if I just wasted $60.",
"My wife and I both had to download this app for our 2 year old twice on each of our phones. There's a glitch where the app will repeat ""how many eggs do you see"" over and over again in a loop. It's a great learning app though.",
"The app and the web site have ALWAYS lagged, freeze up and crashed on EVERY device we have used it on the 3 years we've had the membership uninstall reinstall over and over bug NEVER FIX it's truly Disappointing!!! AND it's not just an app thing the website has always done it too.!",
"I just updated today, and now the app is not loading properly. It shows ABC Mouse logo and flips the screen a few times. Next, the screen turns yellow and stalls there. It does not continue to load. I",
"The app does what it says and is a great source of educational fun for children. I had it for my daughter a while back and downloaded it just for a couple days for a friend's kid to play with on a trip. is expensive but worth the money if you use it, and they don't steal it. after the second purchase I canceled almost 2 months ago now. I only intended to use it for a couple days, saw a charge pop up this morning 6/30/19 again on 5/30, again on 5/22. all at 4am. pretty sure it's illegal practice",
This is bs buyer beware. I tried to set up a free trial to start for my child and the site acted as if my card wasnt working. I couldn't get the site to work so come the 12 my card was magically charged for this and I cant use it. Saying that my email does not have an account. Mind you it's the same email and card that the money was taken from. Nobody can tell me anything like it's a total rip off. I will never try using this ever again,
"For a kids educational app, this game is way too slow. Downloads over 200mb and yet takes over 3 minutes to load any game or exercise. This the games and exercises are nice and intuitive, but ABC Mouse can do better in making the app faster and more responsive.",
"Update -- I just got the refund today. It took them about 20days to respond to me. It's not perfect, but better later than never. As for the app itself, I would say -- not good. Some ideas are wonderful and engaging, but the add is not sensitive enough that my son got frustrated (me also) all the time. I suggest that you take advantage of the 30 day free trail to see if it works for you. IT IS A SCAM!!! It took my money without any notice The first month should be free. I just installed this app and they asked for PayPal info. After 30 min of installed this app, I realized that PayPal has sent me a notice that thus company has taken my money, without my concent!!! Imagining if I used a credit card instead of PayPal, when will I get to figure out??? THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM!!!!",
"My son absolutely loves playing this game. This is the only learning app that holds his attention, but the learning path has frozen and he can no longer follow the path which is really starting to discourage him. He is getting more frustrated with the app. I hope it can be fixed soon.",
"This app is so ""addictive"" to my kid. He loved to play and watch the fun video for hours ywt without really learning. For example he is going through the game of 121+345 with White Glove's help yet could not figure 2+3. The language art also stuck after he is able to match all the sound and letters. And the Assessment is charged at arm and leg price. No matter how much I hope to maybe use this part of the app, I will not pay for that.",
"I bought this for my foster kids months ago and was going to keep paying for it for them even though they are no longer here, but in a permanent home elsewhere. Their new parents have yet to install it on their devices (2 months) but since I deleted my app on my device, I had to reinstall it to cancel it. I have tried unsuccessfully to reinstall it, so I cannot cancel membership",
I am being charge for a account that is suppose to be cancel! You guys keep charging me. I just got hit with another charge yet again. Please stop charging my damn card. Nobody is using this account. You make it impossible to get in contact with anyone concerning the account. I want my money back! I don't want to do a update of the app. I don't want any parts of ABC mouse! I clearly want my money back and to stop being charged!,
My son has a blast on here!!! I was never able to get him to slow down or b still until i put the tablet w the app on n i gave him a fat type of stylus n hes a whole different boy! Hes actually retaining what hes learning. He prefers music n painting. Numbers and colors have improved significantly!!! I really truly like this program im definately gonna keep paying it monthly! It is worth it,
"This is absolutely horrible. I just signed up and the app won't even get past the ""get started"" page. it gets to the optional survey on how you heard about abc mouse and continuously loads, I have uninstalled and reinstalled cleared the cache and data and still will not move past this page.",
"1st, my son didn't like this app and stopped using it. 2nd, ABC Mouse was able to charge my bank account even though my debit card was expired and I had not authorized any charges to my new debit card. When I tried to cancel the subscription after the new charges I had to download the app to my phone just to cancel then I uninstalled it. You cannot access that function through your online account in a web browser. Ridiculous.",
This app is extremely slow and to have paid so much money for it. What's the deal with the lagging and buffering if we have to pay for the app? My child has to wait several seconds for the app to load to a next activity. Yes ok let's sit and stare at the screen taking forever to load an activity. Nonsense! Refund please!,
"I bought a new Samsung tablet for my daughter...signed up for this service... but this app is super slow at loading... my child got bored of the waiting and eventually the program itself. Now on to the other more important aspect... when I thought I I stopped my subscription with a confirmation from their site..., one year later I got charged to my credit card for another year...I read about this happening to other persons and I actually thought they had sorted out this dishonest behaviour.",
Was still charged after a year without using it. I go to log back and and it won't take me anywhere on the page other than the sign up to a new subscription page which is pointless because how are we meant to delete or cancel (after knowing I did) if first of all we have to sign up to a new subscription that I'm already apparently getting charged on??????? Shifty!!!!,
"I paid $60 for a year of access and have not once been able to get past the stupid blue screen after logging in. I've deleted and reloaded the app, updated it. It just won't open. The app is literally unusable. I'm furious and I want my money back.",
My kids haven't even used it yet. It won't even download on my kids fire 8 tablets which it says the app is compatible.,
"Canceled the account, still got charged for another year, trying to log back in to cancel AGAIN, and the app does nothing but say something about talkback during play. I can't even enter anything on the log in page! I want this account canceled and my money returned immediately!!",
"Awful!!!! Always was slow or never ever worked. When it came time for them to take their money, they were right on it! When I cancelled my service they said I was refunded in full. No I wasn't! It's been 3 months and all they tell me is to contact my bank! My bank is a nation wide bank and has better things to do then to tell me the same exact thing I can see on my account! Still no refund !! I even e mailed them once a week to let them know and it's a stupid computer generated message.",
"Fraudulent! Signed up for the free trail was stupid and gave them my CC. Now months later after cancelling they still are trying to charge me, every month! App does not work properly total waste of time! Did cancel and deleted the app.",
It's been 9hrs since I purchased this program and the app still has not downloaded to my phone. It's not my phone because I've downloaded something just to be sure it wasn't a error on my part. I need a refund I guess. It's a shame because I was really excited to share this learning experience with my 2 toddler girls.,
"I would give a 5 but, it lags a lot to where some days my son is unable to do his work. Its also very repetitive, my son gets bored because he isn't being challenged enough. Needs improvement. Also there isn't any books that pertain to the real reason for Christmas. You can't find any religious books either completely band which is really silly.",
This is rated as #2 FREE game. It is NOT free. it's not even a one time purchase. After you download it the first thing it takes you to is subscription pricing. I love the abc mouse program at our public library but this is dishonest advertising and I refuse to support it. Also the fact that education for the young is being charged for is what's wrong with the world and I will not help a company take advantage of me wanting to give my kids a chance at a better life.,
"I never subscribe to this app or any of their services. I have found out about this app when my account was charger for paying a subscription. After I have downloaded the app and created an account so I can cancel ""my subscription"". The app is very""heavy"" and forced my phone to restart good 3 times. I have never use the service and I would like my money back. Cannot contact customer service as my phone is restarting.",
My 6 year old uses this app as part of his homeschool activies. i love how the app is so easy to use and the content just amazing i would highly recommend this app to start your kids out on their journey of learning. i know theres a lot of learning apps out there but i believe none come close to ABC MOUSE thanks to the developers of this app for the work they do to shape young minds.,
"I just purchase an annual subscription today and it won't work on any of our devices, android or apple. it only says 502 Bad Gateway every time I try to open the app. I'm hoping that my subscription can be extended to a year from when it actually starts working. When/if it starts working, I will gladly update my review.",
"I am not sure what's going on with this app. When I try to open it, it opens to a blank yellow screen. Even after a long wait, it doesn't open up. Very disappointed because I usually use this app with my twins when we have a long wait to keep them preoccupied. Please help correct this issue.",
"Seems very nice, but extremely disappointed that it's not in Spanish like it advertised to be only thing in Spanish is written instructions when it comes to account settings. No educational videos or games are in spanish everything is in English. Not what I expected I was really hoping for an actual COMPLETE Spanish version of this.",
"Excellent app for learning, both my kids love it! It's easy to understand yet very. challenging. I'd recommend this product to anyone with kids looking to help sharpen their child's acedemic abilities.",
I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the year's membership. From the other complaints ABC Mouse seems to have a problem. I haven't even been able to download the app. When I try to use the online version it won't let me move ahead. Am I able to get a refund for this because it makes no sense that I can't access it. Telling people to uninstall and reinstall does not help. It's the same problem.,
my kids loved this app. when are you gonna fix the landscape to portrait issue it is having with the constant rotating. can't even get past the load screen anymore on our mobile devices. i don't have a computer for them to use and I'm trying to get them prepared for school in August. very irritating.,
"Totally frozen, unusable app. tried from ipad and phone.managed to get through the signing up (over half an hour and after deleting and redownloading the app) so they now have my payment details. wonder if I will be able to cancel subscription in a month (if I find a time when it does not get frozen) shame, I had high hopes for the app.",
"My son is stuck at the Coral Reef Level 7 Lesson 45 at first grade level. It's been this way for a week and I have restarted his tablet and uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. For paying $60 altogether for this, I expected better. I also contacted your support and they were not apologetic or nice at all. Please fix this.",
"I love this app on the tablets. However, trying to use this on the computer is a little difficult for my daughter. I have a touch screen and she like to use the touch screen to draw her letters but it is not user friendly. I wish this app was offered through the Microsoft store.",
The first day I used this app really enjoyed all the options that was offered and my kids really enjoyed it but on the second day I tryed to use the app it was freezing a lot making it frustrating for me and my kids. Please work out the kinks and I would definitely be back!,
The log in button doesn't work. Tried for hours but online the sign up button works! Not worth time or money. Games and challenges aren't exactly quality learning for kids. My husband and I are teachers so we get ABC mouse for free but won't be encouraging our kids to use it.,
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APPLICATION! This is unbelievable. I just downloaded this application. Not even the free trial, I paid for it. I paid to stare at the ABC mouse screen. It freezes on my phone, it freezes on my computer, and it freezes on my son's tablet. I want a full refund. DO NOT DOWNLOAD DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APPLICATION!",
"It constantly freezes, just spent all that money for an app that doesn't work on any of our devices properly. The loading times are so long the kids lose interest, we were so excited for this!",
for one child I think and feel it's very good. for the other channel I believe it has too many games I need to get my child reading at a kindergarten level but he said he wants to do the Arts and games and you know stuff like that so that's the only part I Don't like!.,
I can't get the app to load on cellphone or tablet. It opens with logo and then goes blank. It's a great program but since we dont have a computer for the kids I will be canceling subscription if app doesn't get fix soon.,
"I am so grateful that my daughter is learning so much! learning is fun to my child and I am so grateful for these amazing tools like ABC mouse that make it possible to keep it fun and modern. well I love using tangible paper products that are very old school now I really appreciate that we can have a space for her to learn on the go, at home, or even on a long road trip. This is literally the type of app I have been hoping for",
"Terrible! This app never works, I haven't even been able to cancel my subscription because it won't ever function properly. The website brings you back to the faulty app, so I've been paying for a crappy app that doesn't work for the last 6 months!!!! Would love my money back, but Lord knows that isn't going to happen...",
"I can't change user. The name does not exist in the drop down. It also does not exist on the website. However, on the website, you can go to Classroom, and on the left menu, you can click change user. This app when going to classroom, does not have the left side menu. Waste of time trying to set this up.",
"Some games are making her get it wrong in order to go to the next level. Its really frustrating for me and her. How can she learn colors when she is always getting the answer wrong. Pop the yellow ballon, it says. But when she is popping yello it's not working till you go to the next balloon over.",
Terrible app! Do NOT download unless you want to pay a monthly subscription for an app that lags and does NOT work. and then almost impossible to unsubscribe too!! I have a samsung Galaxy Note 8 and it does NOT work on my phone !! shame that people have gone to the extremities to even use children apps for extortion !,
This would be great and my kid would love it. If it would load! have only ever been able to do one or two things before it basically won't respond at all. They never have problems taking my loading my subscription money though. Thoroughly unimpressed and will be cancelling,
"Awful app, every screen takes forever to load... Maybe if your kid is very patient but no way younger kids would wait that long. It takes well over a minute. Also, there is not an option to lock your kid in the app, so if they don't like it they can just click back and go to YouTube or whatever",
I paid for a subscription and have yet been able to do anything on the site. It just keep reloading on the log in page. I have uninstall and reinstall 3 times and still the same thing keep happening!,
"When it works, it's awesome. The app is constantly frozen or when I log in to the parents section, it gets stuck on the loading page. Going to the website doesn't help. It sends you to the app.",
"I cant even use the app! My 4yr old liked it for maybe 5 minutes (as most toddler attention spans allow for). My phone broke and I had to get a new one and decided to cancel abcmouse. After deleting apps I ACTUALLY use just to install the app to my new phone, IT LOADS TO 99% AND MAKES ME RESTART THE INSTALLATION PROCESS YET AGAIN. This has happened 4x already today and I am very disappointed. I am being charged for a service my kids couldnt even use if they wanted to. I had higher expectations.",
"I'm SO HAPPY with this app! Yes, I paid for the service & SERVICE IS EXCELLENT! I recently struggled with the unknowns concerning pandemic, work, bills; THE ONE THING I DID NOT WORRY ABOUT WAS MY 5 YEAR OLD'S SCHOOLING. Very affordable, with TEACHING TOOLS & MANY entertaining exercises & games. Probably the BEST $$$ I've spent on my son's budding education. I rated 4 stars tho I REALLY wanted to give it a 5, I was disappointed to learn ""The Assesment"" function cost extra another yearly fee.",
"My son loves this, however the app crashes now seconds after opening. I've checked for updates and uninstalled and reinstalled it with no improvement. I'm going to have to cancel my membership because we can't use it anymore",
"Horrible registration process, tons of ads, asks you to upgrade 5 times. No free option. Free trial @ $9.99 a month after that. Slow, freezing, force closing. But my kid has to have it, so they got you under their thumb.",
Don't download. NOT FREE!!! I spent 30 minutes downloading this and another 15 min installing only to come up to a main page where you go to put in credit card information and stuff but you can get one month free and then they will auto charge you $9.95 a month until you cancel. You you don't even get an option of having a dumbed down version of this app to see if we would even like it. I don't want to pay for something I have no idea if I'm going to like or my kids going to use!!,
This app does not work. I have tried to redownload it many times and I still have the same issue. It will not load past main screen and when it does it freezes. I will not be keeping my membership.,
I've been charged 2 months in a row for this useless app! I've been trying to cancel the free trial since Oct. Customer service is non existent. App freezes and I'm totally beyond frustrated. Cancel my free trial refund my money for November and December!!!!,
It either won't load up or it freezes as soon as it opens up,
My daughter loves ABC mouse when it works. The problem is it's always glitching and freezes up and stops working i have a year subscription if this problem isn't resolved I won't purchase another year. I only gave it a 4 star because my daughter said to.,
The app won't open and I keep getting an error message!,
"I want a refund, Ive never even logged in until this app sucked money from my account. Then on login they just keep trying to get you to sign up to charge you more money?!? Very unappealing!!Then the process just to cancel the subscription is just ridiculous. I only signed up to get gems for a different game, none of your services was given. Its name should be give me your money!?!?",
"OK so at first,my son who is 4 now loved this app,was into it because we both saw it on TV and since he is already advanced or should I say a little above his learning level,I decided to surprise him last year with this....now I'm regretting it...he lost interest after he discovered the HAMSTER game and didn't want to do anything else smdh...also as someone else mentioned, the games really aren't that interesting..I KNOW you can change the learning level but even then it's a no. Taking off!",
"It's not worth a penny completely a waste of money. It is loaded and installed once, and then it never loads anymore crashes every time it opens. Paid $45 a year subscription for it to crash, and my daughter learns nothing.",
"A very cohesive, well rounded preschool program. The only negative is that I cannot leave my child to listen to stories and know he will not navigate out of the app. If ABC Mouse required a password to close out of it, it would be absolutely perfect.",
"As far as learning apps go this is terrible, especially for the price of $13 a month. There are so many free apps that do the same thing better. With all the hype around this service I expected more. There is no way to curate to individual children's learning abilities, and what minimal parental controls there are don't work properly. For this to even remotely be worth the price the activities need to be assignable to a child's curriculum so they learn what they need with full report generation.",
"Mixed feelings here. My kids love this, but I have to restart the app at least four times an hour to keep it working. And the 'Professor Hester's Heart Facts' activity doesn't work at all, and there is no way to skip an activity on the learning path, so my son is stuck there, unable to do anything to move forward.",
I love this app so much!!it's fun and learning and good for little kids like me and I want to say this game should be 10 out of 10 this a really good app and it's so much fun it make me got to sleep I love this app so much!!‚ù§üíóü•≥üòÅ,
"My kids absolutely love abc mouse! Its so educational and super fun! There are so many exciting games, activities, videos and much more. I could read them a story from the library, or we can sing the nursery rhymes. My 4 year old can do it all by himself",
"Logout Issue When not in use or just suddenly overnight, the app logs us out of the account. I constantly have to log back in so my child can use it. Good app, but this part is frustrating. Please stop automatically logging out of app.",
"subscribed to this app three months ago, the app was not loading and was too slow for me, therefore I deleted it. To my greatest surprise, an unauthorized amount of money was deducted from my account to the tune of Six Thousand, Two Hundred, and Thirty-Five Naira, Twenty Kobo (6,235.20). It will be appreciated if the same was paid back into my account as soon as possible because it wasn't authorized by me. Thanks.",
"I install the apps for my grandson on a brand new amazon fire tablet, and all its does is freeze and collapse. No matter how many times I try to get it to open up it never does this app is no good I would like my money returned. I've been trying for over a 2 week to get into the app to cancel it. But it is not allowing me to cancel it. How do I get my refund and cancel it?",
It is a wonderful learning tool for my now 4 year old. We have been using ABC mouse for 2 years now and I can't say anything bad about it! I will continue getting ABC mouse for my son because it really does work!! Everyone who meet him tells us how intelligent he is! I credit some of that to ABC mouse! 5 stars from us!,
their payment system is extremely glitchy. I have tried to set up an account several times and it has never worked so I've never actually gotten to use the app. still haven't heard from customer service about that.,
"love ABC mouse but the app is super slow. I have a note 8 and 4g network. it lags and takes forever. sometimes the lessons wont open period. I loved it for my pc, but no longer have it. the app is lousy.",
"It took awhile to download and put the code in. Once I was able to Sign in, it would not let me go to the lessons. I pressed the Continue button and a little sign spun around but would not go any further. Like it was locked up. I had a Code to get it free. Is that the reason I can not get in to do any lessons? Please help or give me a Phone # so I can call and talk to someone, Please. Mary Perschbacher",
"App is great for the kids, very good learning games, very happy with that. Program interface not so great. Lots of lag time, changing profiles difficult and time limit management is ridiculously complicated. When time limit is up for one child, program freezes forcing the parent to extend time for one kid just to change profile. Plus if the time runs out and tablet is put away, PW still has to be entered next day to work again. Good for kids, a little frustrating for parents. Pleas fix these bug",
Have been charged following my free trial even though I thought I had cancelled it. Now I'm trying g to cancel again but have to download the app which is doesn't seem to be working. I can't afford for these payments to come out of my bank and am so annoyed at the difficulty I'm having trying to download the app just so I can cancel. Not impressed.,
"My 4 year old loves it! She's always excited to play and earn tickets to go shopping.great motivation.lots of activities. I can see her making progress in learning numbers and letters. Also lets me have a few minutes of quiet time without feeling guilty about her being on the phone/tablet. ""ABC mouse is soo cool and so fun""",
"This app is ridiculous. I signed up for it to increase my chances of winning something. And just like the site the contest was through , there is multiple screens that just run you in circles. I had a hell of a time fully unsubscribing. Don't let that happy little mouse fool you. He just wants your money.",
Removed the shapey friends math section that was included in the subscription and made it a whole other app not included in the monthly payments we already make. My daughter loves the shapeys and this broke her heart. I'm lucky she understands that momma isn't going to pay for something extra when we were getting it included before but other parents may not be so lucky. As soon as my year is up I will be cancelling my subscription to this greedy company. Completely disappointed.,
I bought the year subscription and my children cant even play it. It freezes and wont load. If they do get to do an activity it wont save and when contacting the company i received an email saying they were having a lot of issues they would be in touch with me soon. I really thought this would be great for my children and they were excited but it wont work.,
"The learning games are great but this app runs sooo slow that interferes with my child's learning. I ended up subscription dueto this because it's ridiculous how slow this app runs. My child loves ABC mouse but it's not worth paying my hard earned money for, if it was free I wouldn't complain but since it's not than I definitely want mymoney worth",
I will say that from my child's pov this app is great. However from my perspective this app is very money hungry. It is very difficult to cancel once you sign up. Especially if your child never really uses it. I would give more stars if this app were set up in such a way that the system recognized that you weren't using it and charge as such.,
"Such a scam. They removed the shapeys/math character games after having included them for several months, so that they can sell them in a separate APP. As an educator, it irks me that families cannot pay you ONE subscription fee to serve their family. You've already got a separate subscription for older kids. Now you've got a separate subscription for the math games. Absolute garbage on your part. üóëüóëüóë",
DO NOT DOWNLOAD! THIS IS A SCAM APP AND WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!!! My debit card has been charged twice 03/02/2020 and 03/30/2020 in the amount of 9.95$. I want this money refunded immediately! I did not authorize this transaction. I do not have an active account! This is a terrible thing to do during an active financial cisis! I will be reporting this to my bank and I will take the appropriate actions if the funds are not returned to my bank account.,
"This app has been horrible for the last 2 months. Even the website freezes. All pf our progress has been lost and we're being forced to start new learning plans, but when we try to start new plans it just loads.",
"i really appreciate for quick response and help from customer desk. my son enjoys a lot of stuff across this site and i can definetly see some change in him. but at times he nly sticks to what he likes rather then moving ahead on learning path, which is think there should b some parental control otherwise its really good home schooling.",
"Updated review; I have 2 daughters, one is 4 with 2nd stage autism, and her younger sister is 2 with adhd (my personal diagnosis) I allow them only about 2 hours of TV a day, but they get around a total of 3 hours screen time every day if you include ABC mouse. They absolutely love ABC mouse and everything my phone/tablet says ""welcome back"" they come running! I've had ABC mouse a little over a year now and I gotta say, it's amazing! They love it and learning quickly every day! 10/10",
"In general, the app is decent, however, the main problem I have is it is WAY OVER PRICED! When my kids do play it, I know they enjoy it, but, like Every child, they don't play on it consistently as there is MANY, MANY other apps just as entertaining, educational & CHEAPER!! Every single month when I see the charge for $12.99,I cringeüòñ.I suggest doing 30day free trial&IF ur kid(s) use it consistently & actually use everything the app offers, then it MIGHT be worth the $.Good Luck w/the decision!",
"Horrible - gave no password after signing up. Tried to reset password with their online tool, the link they sent in my email forwards me to a web page telling me to download the app. I already have the app and requested the password reset from it. Cannot access any features due to not being given a password. Have screenshot with username (like the website said to do on registration). Checked multiple times, no password. Terrible.",
My grandson loves to play a lot of different things but we only let him play for specific times.,
I just purchased a year subscription and the app won't load on my son's Samsung Galaxy Tab A. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling as well as clearing the play store cache and data. Still just has a spinning icon when I try to open the app. Please help or I will cancel.,
"App does not work and was the major reason we purchased the program. Help is not addressing the correct problem (only giving me information to fix in the browser, not on the app). Very disappointed as my son loves the program, but what's the point of having the program if the app doesn't work? We will stick to Khan Academy Kids....",
"I am unable to download the app to cancel my account. My phone can download anything else I've tried to use from the play store, but the download for this app gets stuck at 72% and stops working. Might be the worse scam I've seen.",
Major Issues. I understand the overload from all the schools closing. But my 2 boys have the exact same tablet and it will work perfectly on one but says may not be optimized on the other. They are exactly the same type model etc. Its aggravating when your trying to get them both to do their homework but they cant do it together.,
"This is my son's favorite app. Unfortunately, several months ago they updated it and it no longer works on his Samsung tablet. We have connected support multiple times. The most recent contact I was simply sent a list of system requirements (all of which we met) and the agent closed the ticket. I paid for a year of service that is not usable and the company clearly has no interest in serving their customers who are going children.",
"My daughter absolutely loves ABC MOUSE! She has learned so much from the videos and games. Her vocabulary is incredible, she knows fun facts about places and historical landmarks, and has already began to figure out simple math equations in the beginning of her kindergarten year!",
This app keeps freezing! Which is sad because my daughter loves it but gives up when the pages don't work. Wish they would fix that problem. Don't bother paying monthly for it. I got 2 months free from Groupon.,
"Downloaded the app on my phone and both my children's tablets app does not work this is why I canceled it last time cuz I could never get the app to work even though I was paying for a subscription. So I canceled my account and uninstalled it about a year later actually two weeks ago my daughter asked if we could try it again, I renewed my subscription and reinstalled it on my phone and both my daughters tablets and having the same problem but they had no problem taking my money but I can't use",
I love abc mouse! My daughter is a very interactive learner. I've tried just regular textbook learning with her and it did not work she would gett too distracted. ABC mouse give her the opportunity to work at her own pace learning what she wants to learn. Its definitely helped my daughter out,
"Won't allow me to click on anything when I'm taken to the log in page. I can't click on the boxes to enter my login info or on any of the links, ie: Terms of Service, Forgot Password, etc. When I went to exit and was asked to confirm if I wanted to leave the app I couldn't confirm or deny - so again couldn't click on anything. The home page worked fine but nothing outside of that seemed to.",
"So easy to pay for a subscription but when it comes to cancelling it all of sudden it stops working. Our cellphones, tablets, and laptop all froze when it got to the cancelling screen. By the way we had already cancelled but we're still getting bill which is why we're trying to access the account. We want our money back! And DONT TELL ME TO PLEASE CONTACT YOU GUYS ON THE APP FEED BACK BECAUSE IT DOESNT WORK!!! WE WANT TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE (NOT A ROBOT OR AUTOMATED EMAIL RESPONSE)",
"Level 1 lesson 12 on the learning path does not load.I believe it is the cows animations. My son is stuck on that one because the app will not let him continue. He loves this app, but this issue makes this app a 1 star app. If the issue is fixed I will change rating.",
"Lots of great free apps are included that work without wifi, adding even more skills and content to the original app which is already so good, reliable, educational. I only wish all the other apps were also available on Kindle.",
"Not worth it-wont load majority of time. It takes so long just to open the app then actually playing its constantly loading for minutes, sometimes the next activity won't even come up so you have to x out and start over. Had high hopes for this, try something else if your going to spend money.",
"Good content and my kid loves it, WHEN it works. Thats the main problem, it constantly freezes and bugs out on both my s10 and the galaxy tab. It's just a buggy app in general. Highly disappointed especially considering the subscription costs.",
The app keeps crashing and it won't let me log on onto the website on my phone. The website also takes a long time to load and keeps lagging. The idea is great but I can't stand paying for something that doesn't work. I will be canceling my subscription.,
"Wasted 2 free trial subscriptions to see if it was a good fit for my daughter or what! ATTENTION SAMSUNG GALAXY USERS, THIS PROB WONT WORK FOR YOU! Ive tried on two diff devices I understand why it wouldnt work on the cheap one, but the samsung?? If ABCMOUSE isn't going to let Galaxy users use it, then why charge its a big waste & why advertise that it will work, maybe they just dont care to fix it.. I really wanted my child to try this, shows a black screen every time, even after your update.",
"It just keeps saying ""change user"" for no reason. It's on my son's name. That's the user I want it on. There are no other users. Won't let us play under his name. Won't let me add a user. I have tap 3x to put in ANY letters for my password. This app is GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!! I want my $80 back.",
"So far my 4 yo grandson and I are loving this! He gets to go to school! We do it in the morning almost every day. I don't have to force him at all, and he is learning new things. My hope is to have him reading by kindergarten. I'm not a teacher, but I raised 5 kids of my own and this is easy for me. I do stay with him and read instructions for him and help him stay focused. He is already experienced at working kid apps on a tablet, which is helpful. He loves earning tickets to buy pets, etc.",
This is an amazing app and my kids love it. the problem i have is they need to upgrade their servers. the app is so slow on any device. it frustrates me because its so slow some days and my kids get even more frustrated. why are we paying for something that cant be played some days.,
"The app does not open, when it does the load times are very long, and the user interface is not great. Content seems good, but other issues make it not matter.",
"I am usually a huge advocate of this app and website as we USED it quite frequently in our homeschool curriculum. However I have been charged every month for the last 6 months and none of the apps on the 2 tablets, 3 phones, or 3 computers have worked. I am highly upset, because this is HUGE chunk of our learning program.",
"Great app and my kid loves it but... I hate that this is true but this app is so frustrating. Takes FOREVER to load. In the lessons, map, my stuff.. everything. Walked away for 10 minutes and still hadn't loaded. Will be canceling unless it gets better.",
Changing my rating from 1 to 3. The app never worked on my daughters (older) tablet. I paid for a one year subscription and we never got to use it. They charged me for a new subscription and I asked for a refund. They gave me a refund with no trouble.,
"This has been a very frustrating time, my son that has been trying to play for two days , everytime this app. doesn't work well. Has brought him too tears, everytime. It keeps loading but simply doesn't work, it starts off like it will, only to let him down, I'm on a Samsung tablet a, wish someone could help . Placed my payment information.",
Very slow loading and updating takes FOREVER! By time we get to the lessons my son is so discouraged because how long it takes to load and even then a lot of times it'll freeze and all his progress.... LOST!!! So frustrating!!!,
"I could not get this app to work on my phone at all. It constantly went blank screen. Have plenty of space. Works great on computer. If it did what it does on the computer on my Android 9, kernal 4.4 I would give 5+ stars.",
"Good if it works... I have had abc mouse for several years now, and this is the first time i have hit a snag. Some of the newer activities in the learning path refuse to load. Especially the bunny hop one, and my son cannot move forward past it.",
"Would be great as daughter loves it but now downloaded on 2 devices and it just crashes every 2 minutes. Frustrating. Thank god it's the free trial, was going to purchase but not with these issues !",
"My 2 year old twins will be 3 in September and they are not talking. I've heard a lot about this app, that it helps the most difficult of kids learn things. Well I wanted them to try it without giving my card info. I dont have the money to pay for an app that's not gonna work. I get that theres a 30 day free trial, but I'm not giving my card info for a free trial.",
My son loves the songs and he likes being able to change his avatar. I like how there is a daily class.I wish there was a way to hold him accountable. Like a notification or a message to mom through text or a reminder to watch his daily classroom also I wish there was a better way to track what he has done.I know it shows in total what he has done but I like to give him goals. I just see a lot of things that could be added. I'd rate it 5 but some days the class doesn't load until the afternoon.,
"We have had ABC mouse for 3 1/2 years now and I love seeing how my daughter has grown. She is now in kindergarten and I feel like she is light-years ahead of her peers. All of her teachers have been impressed with how advanced she is and it makes me feel good, like I've done something right. She is reading simple sentences and even doing basic addition when they haven't even started anything close to that in school. Thank you!",
"I paid for this app but could never get it to work properly, but my grandson could do some things so I was ok..I'll fix it later..forgot..then was charged again ,he hasn't been on the app,I thought I was supposed to be billed monthly and I canceled, but apparently not and we do not have the app,haven't even logged in in months,and now was charged again..downloaded again to cancel the subscription and see about a refund..and now I still can not get on there to do the parent's thing..refund!!!",
"it is is sooo perfect for kids to learn they can not only learn math science reading and more but they can take care of pets in the game they become creative of there character and have many options, if they have siblings and the siblings don't wanna play its perfect cause they kearn with games. it is very educational.",
"Great for my kids, but every so often we hit a snag and part of the app stops working for weeks or months. Like currently, even with several email attempts, my son`s pets cannot be completely happy because the activities attached to them will not complete and switch. But nonetheless, I am very happy with the app because its giving me a good homeschooling start for him and its allowing him to excel in some areas and get more practice with the subjects he has trouble with. It works at his speed. üòÅ",
"My now 5 year old daughter has been using this app for about 3 years now. It has been great, up until recently when I notice that my/her account doesn't seem to be working. I haven't gotten a notice about renewing the subscription and I'm usually goo about that. I'm wondering what the issue is?!... it's been at least a couple months now.",
"My son loves getting on ABCmouse everyday. I have to fight with him to get off. Its helping him learn in a way that's easy for him. I've seen so many improvements with his speech, and his milestones. He's a 3 year old autistic child and I HIGHLY recommend this app!!!",
"I really am frustrated because we've been trying to use the app for 3 months and it won't allow us in. Why has this not been fixed? I need a refund or something. NO ONE pays for a service that they CANNOT use, ugh. And, I have uninstalled & re-installed the app a plethora of times with no avail!",
Not impressed. Read through some reviews and see generic responses saying the problem is fixed but it isn't. I have only had the app a week and my kids have only gotten maybe 5 minutes of time on it. It freezes constantly. Cancelled my membership...let's see if I actually get my money refunded. Not happy at all.,
Can't even get app to load. Keeps kicking us out.,
"I have been using abcmouse since my oldest granddaughter was 2 now she's soon to be 8. She's going into 3rd grade this year but last year in grade 2 she was reading on a 4th grade reading level most of the year, and moved up in math to a 4 th grade level. Now my other two grand daughters are using it one 3 and the other is 2. Can't wait to see how fast they advance in school.",
"It wasn't needed after all, but to cancel and get a refund is nearly impossible! I normally don't like writing bad reviews, but they don't or won't give me my refund after paying a year upfront and in just the following day I tried by Email, an Calling and then referred to the Email and even that gave me a Migrain/Severe headache which made things worse for me. Because now I have nowhere you turn, and I know that they want $$, I will seek Legal advicement. I will inform you of the result later.",
They don't refund your money. I tried free trial period and within 24 hours I cancelled my subscription on the 24th. They immediately took $59.40 out of my account. I wrote them on the 24th on the app to find out when they will refund my money. I still haven't received a response or my money back. Do not use (trial period). It's a scam.,
My 5yo son has been using ABC Mouse for about a year now. He has improved soooooo much. My 2your also uses it. He is already able to read simple books. This program has exceeded our expectations. Definitely recommend to anyone with little ones!!,
"Can anyone help me? I recently downloaded the app and today when I tried to open it it said failed to extract resources needed by II2CPP. I don't know what that means or how to get help about it. In my play store it doesn't indicate that it needs an update so I'm honestly stuck. Thank you in advance, My family loves the app 11 years with 7 different childrenüí™üèæ",
"I've had this for awhile now. Haven't used in quite a few months (9 mo) . It automatically renewed which was no problem I just had to go on the site, sign in and cancel right? Well it wouldn't let me log in without putting my account information back in then had the nerve to charge me AGAIN!!! I've been trying for a week to get someone on the phone or email. With the state of the world today i can't afford to pay or lose $50.99 let alone $130 for a site I can't use for one child!!!",
What is going on with this app?! My daughters love this app but it doesn't work half thr time and thr other half it is forcing closed! Please update this and make it right! I will change my rating after that!,
I LOVE THIS APP. The only down side to this app is that it ends at 2nd grade. I have no problem getting my hyperactive 4 year old to do her lessons. She spends more than an hour everyday on this app. The best part is she thinks she is just playing a game. She went from knowing zero letters to knowing 5 letters in just 1 week. She has always struggled in school and now she is so happy to learn.,
"I think it sucks. I have downloaded this damn game to my phone my laptop, my other son's tablet and then my young son's tablet and every time I do I get to a blue screen and then it completely stops working it doesn't take me anywhere the one time I paid for it it refunded me my money and I have no idea why. I'm really starting to get angry with the game especially when you get the commercials saying ABCmouse works. Is there anything you guys can do to fix it my boys have been wanting to play.",
Submitted an email to support regarding a duplicate charge to my credit card on 03/24 because of a glitch in the application that I need refunded ASAP and have not heard from anyone at all. This is poor service during a trying time! My ticket is #4086078 and I would very much appreciate someone responding to assist me.,
"My 2.5 year old son loves this app when it will respond. We only use it on his Amazon Fire Tablet and I'm not sure if it would work better on a laptop or desktop. But there is no way I would let him touch my laptop at his age. It's really well developed and you can select it to your child's age. However, we spend a lot of time waiting for his selection to load and then he loses interest in using it. I've even set it aside for 10-15 minutes and it is still not working when we come back to it.",
My prek students and kindergartners love playing and learning,
Will not load & freezes if it does,
It's so disappointing for me and my child when we look forward to a new free educational game and it's not free! People cannot afford these monthly subscriptions! Working single parents have a next to impossible time getting kids to their local library or sitting down with each individual child to help with their education. It should NOT be listed under free. Such a waste of time and space.,
Love ABC Mouse! When we first got ABC mouse my kid's were 4 and 2. They are now 5 and 3 and really enjoy their time playing. For them to have tablet time they must play ABC mouse first for at least 30 min... which they do not at all mind... I know that they are getting fun activities that are teaching them thing's that their other apps do not. I know that when they play ABC mouse that I do not have to monitor them. It's a safe and 100% appropriate for my kid's to play. Thank you ABC mouse!,
"My kids don't use it and I cancelled it. Today I got an email that stated it has been place on pause until July 15,2022, I did not ask for it to be paused. I would like to change my rating. I reached out to Chat, and the representative was very helpful and assisted me with cancelling my account. It was quick and easy.",
"I have 3 different android devices and the app won't load on any of them. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. Rebooted the devices, still the same yellow patterned blank screen. I would like a refund for this scam of a product. Who do I contact to get it?",
I have been wanting to cancel my subscription and payments to ABC mouse for over 6 months now. You could see on your system I have not signed in for more than 6 months. I have never recieved a reply and ABC mouse are still taking money from my account after I have sent numerous emails. Within excess off $250.,
"If I could leave zero stars I would! I cancelled my subscription in July. I was not billed August or September, October they charged my account 1 cent, then November charged the full monthly fee! I daughter no longer uses this app which is why we cancelled in July. DO NOT get a subscription they continue to bill after you cancel!!!",
You can not pop all the balloons on those levels. If you have to pop the top of the balloon and only the bottom is showing my child cannot pass that level. I am off to finding a better app that actually works,
"App keeps crashing on my Galaxy S22 Ultra. It's not limited to just one activity. Almost completely unplayable. I just installed the app today for the first time. The kids usually play from my wife's phone. With it being a brand new install, I'm not sure what else to do to troubleshoot.",
This is not a free app you guys are conning me into getting this app. It says top free I downloaded and what do I see? the first thing I see is 30-day free trial. really? that's false advertisement. I loaded the app then quickly uninstalled. I really hope you guys did not start charging me because I did not even enter any of my information. if I am being charged I will report you!,
I tried the free trial and found it was not used enough by my grandson to continue the subscription. Now I cannot get on the site to cancel my subscription because it keeps saying I am using an invalid e-mail address. .I was billed last month and will probably be billed this month unless someone can help.,
I loved this app for my toddlers up until the point where it's been on the same lesson for the past 2 weeks and won't let him advance. I've tried logging out and then back in and nothing has worked. it's very frustrating,
"Unfortunate though not misleading. If you are unsure about this type of educational aid, read the user agreement carefully. Even if the prepaid yearly subscriptions are tempting, the result is not as advantageous if your pupil (in this case, my Grandkids) loses interest or generally becomes bored with it. If you buy the year and evaluation subscription, you are not refunded a pro-rated sum. Be sure before you invest. My advice: pay month to month until you have a clear idea of the benifits.",
"Too slow and freezes up. People please see this same honest frequent complaint in many of the reviews. The information of the app is great. However it is very,very slow and it freezes up. Im glad they offered this trial period. I dont think I am going to stick around and pay for this after my 30 days are up. My toddler will be sad that its gone. She really enjoys it when it works properly.",
"Update...Even after reinstall the app will not work on my Samsung device. So far I can't even sign in...once I open the app onlyhalf the screen shows. Going to try to Uninstall andtry again, because every other app works, so it's not my device.",
"Ok....so I just downloaded the app. And the app is stuck on the second page for me to put in my information as mother. I can not type anything, the screen is stuck. I have tried to get pass this second page for a long period of time and still nothing. I'm not convinced that this app is right for my daughter. There should not be any problems with this app from all the good reviews that I have read. With that being the influence of me downloading this app for her.",
"I just downloaded this and have not even been able to use it! I made an account, put in my card info and that was it. I cant do anything else. it pops up this box to put in nickname ect, but the screen it pops up is a quarter of the size of my screen, it wont let me enter any information, but when I click continue it tells my I have to fill out the info? I cant even get on enough to cancel my card? very irritating!!! will be figuring out how to cancel!!!!!",
I had a free 3-month membership and they charged me every single month I ended up having like six months worth of charges never even got on the site. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. I got the coupon from Groupon. A free 3 month subscription!,
the overall content is good. the system is very slow loading. I would like to see more consistency in learning and perfecting subject before move on. small test or quiz along the learning path can help with less coloring options.,
"we are having so many issues with the app. I have had the subscription for years with no problem, but lately my kids cannot even use it. It keeps freezing up and locking them out. This is happening across all our devices. For a service I am paying for, I am very disappointed.",
"I was in special Education all through school. I could not relax in school from bullying from classmates and kept recycle the negative in my head from home. I was able concentrate on the present to comprehend my school work. ABC Mouse helps me feel relaxed and for first time in my life learning is fun for me. This 39 years old is able look at learning as fun , instead fear and anxious when learning. I am learning faster. I still have go over information few times when not given in small pieces.",
"Right at the moment, we are facing a ton of trouble with moving forward in the learning path, which we use as a sort of homework for our daughter's homeschool. Long time user, so I really hope to stay with ABC mouse, but if this keeps up we will be forces to find a better option.",
Shame on you ABC mouse for portraying a 30 day free promotion instead I am out of $100 because the app is confusing you pay a $60 fee for the app then it takes you to another screen forcing you to pick another annual service fee $40. My child is not 2 yet and I was hoping to start her out with some learning tools before school as they advertised but not at an unnecessary expense it is the Pandemic and people don't have money to waste and let's not mention how bad customer support is. Don't buy!,
"I love this for my 2-year-old. However, half the time I can't even use it because it opens and then instantly closes. Very frustrating. I have had to uninstall and reinstall it 3 times now. Even more frustrating because I paid for it.",
"I have had this app for almost a year. It was great, but just recently it started kicking my son out of the welcome screen. He can't get into the app to play. I uninstalled and reinstalled and we're still having issues.",
My son didn't really enjoy abc mouse partially because it kept lagging while he played. I worked with him for a couple months on it before I paused my membership and he stopped using it. I wished after you paused your membership they would send you a email reminder that your membership is about to renew before they charge you again. I just paid for another month for an app my son can barely use. So I just officially cancelled my membership.,
"This is an amazing educational game. Very fun, Many activities. It makes learning fun! The learning path is very fun, You get presents of your choice a couple times in the location.It's 100 ‚Ä¢/‚Ä¢ kids safe, I totally recommend for kids like me! ( 2 years and over ) ( But I am 8, Hope that not confusing )",
"What a joke. Charged extra $4 for nothing I signed up for. Contacted them said to cancel whole thing. Oh, no. They keep on charging. If they really cared, wouldn't they contact me with concerns that my child has not logged on for 3 to 4 months? Nope. They didnt. But kept on charging $14 a month. RIP off!!! ABC Mouse? All 'Bout Cash Mouse.",
Super frustrated how they keep billing you after your membership period ends but dont notify you. I bought a year membership but my daughter was bored playing and only played it for a couple weeks. Now I've spent $140 on it after it billed me for a 2nd year. What a rip off.,
"Content is great. Customer service is not. When my debit card expired, and phone wouldn't let me update card, I was told there is no CSR to speak to about billing issues. Ok. Then the subscription will expire!",
"We used this program to get my oldest ready for Kindergarten, it has been such a blessing! Her little siblings even sit with her and play the games, read along (the best they can) and interact. My oldest loves the incentive of earning tickets to buy things in the ""shop"" for her pets. Its been a great way to get her interested in learning.",
It challenges the learner while making it appropriate for their age.,
They make it impossible to cancel. I followed the directions they themselves post and they still want me to download the app on my device just to cancel. It also uses flash which is barely used anywhere anymore so wouldn't work on my newest laptop üòí,
We love this app and is very helpful for our son. However recently we have been getting stuck on the main yellow opening screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still same issue. As a paid subscriber this is frustrating. Any help would be appreciated and I will change my 3 stars to 5 stars. Thanks,
The app will not open. I can not even log in to cancel it.. I have been trying to log in for two days. I have a screenshot of my password and email... So I'm not putting in the wrong one. This is junk üò°,
really thinking of cancelling our subscription. we have tried downloading the app on 3 devices and it wont work. it will work on our computer but our 4 yr old doesnt work the computer as well as a phone or tablet. PLEASE FIX!!!,
Love this! I wanted to edit my 5 star review because of some bad reviews. I pay for a few learning apps and this one is one of the best. The assessment testing feature has been an amazing tool for teaching my kids at home. Utilize the product and call customer service for help. We hope to graduate from this program to their newer program at the end of this school year. This comes with a lot of amazing tools.,
"My daughter is 2yrs. old and when we first downloaded ABC Mouse she already knew her abc's & 123's. The basic colors and shapes. So we wanted to expand her mind. She stays at home. No daycare so the classroom on ABC Mouse is great for her to explore. I love the solor system and her knowledge of the moon, the stars, the sky period. She wants to go out at night to show me the moon and the stars. We love ABC Mouse. Com.",
"I got chared after months of canceling my subscribtion, how is that even possible!!!! Please contact and refund me",
Well first off these people charge my credit card for something I don't even use.And they charge every month $9.99 + tax. Then they got there other App Adventure Academy charging my same card $9.99 + tax. Every month also. Then they have a number for you to call and Cancel. BUT? Guess what? They never Answer the Telephone. So to sum it up. There stealing my money and I can't cancel the subscription that I've been trying to do since this has happened.So I rate this(-10 stars) & Adv.Acd(-10 stars,
"My wife and I purchased the program for our son and he was very excited when we finally got logged in, but now I have been trying to login for over 2 hours and it just keeps me at the login screen. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it I tried restarting the device I've tried and tried but it will not load up, I really hope this isn't going to be common place but so far I'm unimpressed to say the least.",
Okay so we downloaded the app for our 4 year old daughter and it was going for the last 3 days but for the last 2 she has been stuck on the same learning path exercise and it will not go past it we have left the laptop open to let the timer go off but nothing and it is very frustrating as for my child wants to continue to learn and play but cant because the lesson plan wont keep going and trust me she has popped enough letter B's that it shouldve let her pass along time agooooo,
"dont do it! you'll end up paying a bunch of hidden fees. have a hard time cancelling, supports not helpful(all macro doesn't actually address you as individual) and they wont refund. app itself functions poorly with little options.",
"I had paid for this app when my daughter was two years old. She is now 11, and I have tried canceling since she was 6.no matter what I do they keep taking my money and will not cancel my service at my request. Just beware they like taking your money ask for a refund for the last how many years now and they keep taking it off my credit card anyway.",
"Absolutely appalling. Promise a free trial and then takes the money straight from your account. Tried getting it back as I think the app is terrible itself and cannot do so. So the ""FREE TRIAL"" is a complete scam!",
If I could give 0 stars I would. My daughter loves it has no problem it's helping her learn however the zero stars would be because they keep taking money out of my bank and have charged me almost $30 for this month. I have contacted customer support which is through email only they don't have a number to call and they aren't resolving anything.,
My daughters love ABC mouse so much. Ive seen a growth in their development in just one short month. They think they are just playing games but they are actually learning so much. They are now interested in reading books everyday.,
"It's a great app that offers a lot. The one thing I wished it did, was to group the activities together. As in, if your doing Math addition 1-10, that all games/activities involving 1-5 were together.",
Crazy I installed the update on both tablets and I still get your device is not optimized for this version. My son has used this for a long while and now I will have to cancel and find a new solution for him to excel further in his education. This makes me sad as we have loved using this app and it has helped my son a ton.,
"Like it, but does not respond well, frustrating kids. The animals screen does not respond to touch on tablets. Can not trace the letters either. Kids eventually get frustrates and give up, going to another app that responds just fine.",
My son has been on this app since school closures due to the virus. He loves school so with abc mouse he still gets to learn. But for the last two days we have not been able to use the app. I've uninstalled and installed it back still nothing. Can someone please help us with this.,
"I sent a message for assistance cancelling, I called a number that was on the site and it continues to say out of service. I just wanted a free trial because I saw it on Groupon. I didn't get around to setting up a profile due to life changes, but to continuously be charged after many cancellation inquiries and attempts üòëüôÑüò§....",
"The constant lags and freezes are annoying. Theres also, in my own opinion, way too much stuff to do outside of the actual ""lessons"". My 5 year old was way more interested in the cat, dog, hamster and fish than anything else.",
"My son absolutely loves this app, he asks me everyday if he can play ABCmouse! I can even actually see improvement in his learning, it's showing in school and at home! Definitely worth the monthly subscription! I highly recommend!!",
I just downloaded it since schools are out. I tried loading it on 4 different devices and after I signed up it locks up and won't work. How can an app that costs so much not work AT ALL??? don't waste your time or money!,
"Would have been a great app if everything didn't take a year to load. It frustrates my daughter to the point of her not wanting to use it which sucks. She uses a galaxy tab 3 with very good internet connection, I just cannot understand the slowness. Will probably move to the next best thing ;(",
"Not happy at all I paid the $29.95 for the subscription for how ever many month and pay the $3.95 monthly just to not be able to use it I cant get reply from them either but they sure did take my money. I signed up on May1,2020 and havent been able to use not once. Tiny screen shows up and has spot to enter what i think is parent info but its so small you cant see it ive uninstalled and installed it many times trying. ABCMOUSE PLEASE HELP OR REFUND MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
"This app is amazing!! It helped my 36 year old son, Nathaniel, learn to read and do math! At first he would only watch porn and never focus on trying to lean anything. I believe his app truley helped him learn to be a real adult and to thrive in the real world that he's surrounded in. The only downside is he doesn't have a credit card so I had to help him. It also helped my 87 year old dad, Jameson, learn to read and how to also do math. He learned so much and he is very proud of himself.",
My daughter loves this app and has learned so much from it being a homeschool and a working mom this has helped me big time with my daughter learning and needing where she needs to be in her curriculum. Don't question the $12.99 a month because it is so worth it! They also have deals where they can give a month or 2 for free! I personally got the 2 month one. Either way all together an amazing app and 100% recommend this to anyone not even just homeschooling parents.,
"The app did not work well on my cell phone and without a mouse for laptop. My 3y/o granddaughter was very frustrated and after a few attempts, she refused to do anything with this program. I requested a refund of my initial payment , but NO response! Not acceptable customer service!",
It is a nice app the kids enjoy and learn but i rate it a 3 because i tried cancelling my subscription 3 times i had to have the app download it to my phone and i did not have enough space to download it had to delete many of my important apps. Since we are already a low income family i hate to let it go but it charged us 12.99 when it said 10.99 a month. Good app just not the best costumer service üôÑ,
"Been subscribing for years, key in the reading success of my oldest two children. Using it now with my 2 1/2 yr old and he's already recognizing several numbers and letters. He has mastered colors and basic shapes. Loves to play the ""pop the bubble"" games.",
"Educationally great. But, slow as molasses on an Acer Iconia running Android 7.0. No other apps open, with free RAM and lots of storage, so tablet is not overloaded at the time. Please help.",
"My son learned his alphabet in 3 weeks and learned how to navigate my phone and tablet. The games for reading are very well thought out and keep his attention even though he is NOT a fan of ""that school stuff."" I've been a teacher for 3 years and would use this in my classroom if I worked with younger children.",
Not compatible with my phone Samsung Fold 3. Can't get a refund and what a loss. Wish they had a trial period for compatibility at the very least. Buyer Beware.,
We got to be apart of this wonderful app with the help of my lo's teacher amidst the covid 19 frantic 1st response. We have thoroughly enjoyed it BUT if I were paying I may have left off a star or two only in that the navigation is a bit tricky and a few other minor things. U guys r doing great!,
"There's so much included that I deleted some of the free apps. But my 3 year old bypassed me by clicking on links in the main app. So it's like Youtube luring you in to endless possibilities. That said, she keeps going back to 'the alphabet game' and has basically taught herself the alphabet during the free trial. She has also vastly improved her writing. The app is free hand unlike others. I don't agree that letter names should come first but since she knows the basic phonics I didn't delete.",
I am not having the best experience with abcmouse. I signed up supposedly paying $9 a month and end up having them withdraw more than that from my bank account.. withdrawing multiple transactions with different amounts... trying to call customers service is even a worse experience because I dont ever get to have my call go through because their call volume is high.. as they say,
"Terrible! I downloaded it and signed up for the 30 days free just to see if my son would like it before purchasing it for the year, the immediately charged me! I have tried numerous times to get ahold of customer service, and got a response about promo codes. I want my money back! Terrible customer service!",
"The app it's self is actually solid. It works well and would use it again. However, the reason I have not renewed after a year is because the app is useless if you do not have internet access. There should be a plethora of games available for such high fees.",
"Idea is good but the app works terribly. I've tried it on my phone, a tablet, and a computer but it constantly freezes or takes forever to load between games. Definitely not going to purchase",
My son has been doing Abc mouse for one year and overall we like it but we have noticed that sometimes the puzzles and games have faulting programming and so sometimes things don't work properly. But overall experience has been good.,
"Works fine, but my kid doesn't like it as much as Khan academy, which is free and just as good. Also abc is trying to keep charging me until the end of the year even after I cancelled. I never signed up for a yearly subscription. Word of advice: ignore this app and get Khan academy kids instead",
"Excellent lessons, most of which my child enjoys. They challenge him, they are fun and interesting, and, with the exception of some confusion by the authors about the difference between fruits and vegetables, they are accurate and complete.",
"Got my 6 year old off youtube! She loves that you earn tickets to 'buy' stuff for your pet in game. She loves the games mostly but also songs and it really seems to solidify her school learning at home. Only drawback for us is that a few things aren't relevant to a uk user, so games involving money, or some of the american spellings. Would be good if the content was altered for a uk audience as well.",
My children love it. My oldest favorite is learning to read with nano. Its making his learning to read journey more fun. Great program it can run slow during certain times of the day but we have had a pretty positive experience.,
"Did not fulfill my expectations. I was highly disappointed the only access to this app for my 3 year old was using my phone. It would NOT work on our chromebook nor our Amazon fire tablet. Also, when I went to cancel my subscription, I had to download the app AGAIN on my phone. Just to cancel. Horrible platform. Will never use again or recommend to others.",
"This app is ridiculous. My account has been over charged 3 times a month for every month I've had it, and you cannot get in touch with an actual person to discuss the issue. Very very unhappy mom here. Thought this would be good learning tool for my daughter, but instead your taking advantage and taking my money!!",
"The technical help was horrible, I couldn't contact & speak with any real person about the technical issue with this program. I want cancel the subscription but it wouldn't let me without downloading the app. I won't recommend this service.",
"Well is not free at all like it said. And i did the research before since May 1, 2020 it was suppose to be free? The best i got was a 59.99 for a year 50% of offer. Plus 3.95 the other section. Good for 2 years olds? Where i need to go at so my 2 years old do studf that she knows hot to deal with? Looks more an app for 4+ Look more like a click bait then.",
I just paid for a 1 year subscription to ABC mouse and paid for a 1 year subscription for the assessment portion. This app won't do anything at all. I don't know think anyone expected this much issue with the schools being out but a warning about outages before people pay a lot of money during a time we should be very careful about spending money would have been great.... now I've paid for something my children can't use.,
"Just purchased membership and hopefully my son can enjoy! By the reviews I can tell you guys it's your phones this programming was originally for computers and all that data coming in at once on a phone is what's causing it to crash. So try a tablet, lap top, or desktop! Hope that helps so your children can enjoy too! It's a great educational system... I will update my review",
"Hasn't stopped loading. It went so smoothly through the registration. Once that was done, nonstop loading. My child still hasn't used the app hours after installing. Cancelling my subscription.",
"I subscribed to it and after all is said and done my son cant even do anything nor can i set up our profile. It literally comes up as a tiny, half screen at the bottom of my computer. Should really work on making the app accessible full page only, especially if youre gonna charge to use it.",
I was a loyal user of this app. My son was starting to show progress. However the app is no longer working. It crashes and freezes up after onlh a few minutes of usage.,
This app installed itself on my phone. I never gave permission to do this. I find this highly suspicious ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Response - Well that's nice it still installed on it's on along with a couple other apps. All apps are now uninstalled. But I wonder who let it happen hmm,
"i have tried to unistall then reinstall but i keep coming to a blank screan, realy wish i coyldvget my month back for this has happened thoughout the month. it has worked up to this month so i dont know whats wrong with it, my daughter loves this app, but sence it stop working we have to look for other apps she wants to play and that keeps her in the game insted of jumping from game to game",
I love ABC mouse but its supposed to be 9.99 a month and for the last year I have charged 9.99 and 3.99 on my credit card and can't get them to respond by email or phone so I have been paying 14 a month. customer service is aweful. not to mention it has not been loading on my daughter's tablet for the last month.,
"Just purchased this program and it keeps crashing on my phone. Having to constantly restart, uninstall and install. Works great on laptop though. LG k92 5G is the type of phone the app is installed on. Update: this app will not open on my phone anymore. Primary reason I purchased was to use it on the phone as it is easier than in front of a computer. Please help or if unable to I would like a refund.",
Downloaded the app on my kids tablet. When the app starts i get the abc mouse logo but then after that i just get a blue screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it a few times but its just the same thing. I can not get past the blue screen.,
"Freezes all the time!!!!! Used to be a great app for my son, now it freezes so much we can't even use it!!!!! I have tried ALL if the troubleshooting tips with no success. would give negative stars if I could!!!!! This is A SCAM!!!!! YOU TAKE PEOPLES money and then don't provide three service promised.",
"I can't even install it I barely have any games but it keep saying I have too much storage I'm giving just one star like the others because there's too much problems I'm so stressed out, because of this I've been hearing some stuff that it takes very hard to load and I can't even install it to see for myself. people say that's very hard to load. I've been hearing stuff that they charge you much. it is even more difficult to install it.",
My daughter would love this app if it didn't freeze every other activity. Paid for the membership only to have Uninstall and reinstall over and over again. She cannot get the full experience if it's consistently freezing.,
"My daughter asked me to get this app again after we canceled it because she became disinterested. In any case, we loved the app previously but now it won't load. We've tried both her kindle and my Galaxy A20. It just hangs on the loading screen. I just paid $10 for a broken app, I guess.",
This app is amazing when it works... for something you pay for I do expect the app to not crash constantly. We're now having an issue where it dosen't want to let me log in even though my password and email is correct. Im about to cancel.,
It's exactly what I need to help me teach my son things.,
My little boy plays this everyday 5 out of 5,
Couldnt get to load the setup process when i subscribed. Just got to work...a month later...not trying to cancel subscription and it wont do anything when i go to my account. So ive been charged and my son hasnt been able to use it once.,
"Way better than the lackluster apps that public school tried using. Plus, my son can use the buttons without my help. He ASKS if we can play and then we race...him on his tablet and me on my phone. Public schools better catch up or they'll be replaced.",
"For the learning part, this app is good. My 1yo loves to learn and she likes the learning pattern. The 3 stars are for the loading time and crashing of games. With an eager child it's difficult to control the situation. Please fix.",
Love this learning tool. My daughter is learning so much. She has vision problems but this is easy for her to navigate and use and i love that she is more advanced than other kids her age. Well worth the money spent,
This app never works on any of my devices and they constantly try and draft the subscription fee numerous times a day. I've been trying to unsubscribe but they app won't even load the home page. Abc mouse on a browser is much better but the app is trash.,
Best learning app ever. I got this for my daughter and she LOVES it. She has learned so much yes some of it is stuff she knows already but with her going in to kindergarten in the fall i want her to learn as much as she can and not forget what she has learned. Also its fun for her to when she gets the tickets for getting thinga right it makes her keep wanting to learn. Thank you abc Mouse for making learning fun.,
"I am very disappointed, I paid for a subscription today and my app isn't working at all, then i tried to install it on another device and it's still not working! But the abc mouse app had no problem with taking my money, only after i paid the app wouldn't work! Please help",
"SO AGGRAVATING!!!! Have to select, then double tap EVER letter every time to type!!! Can't navigate in home screen, select anything or scroll. Damn narrating of everything touched is so irritating! Seriously unusable!!!!!!!!",
We tried it with a month free trial and I ended up paying for a whole year! I am not one to spend money especially on an app. That should tell you something. I absolutely love this app and all that it teaches thank you so much to the developers!,
"Won't let me log in. It's like it's doing system TalkBack, but the feature is not activated. I already uninstalled and reinstalled. What the heck is going on. This app had been on existence way too long to have these issues.",
This looks a SCAM It took MONEY FROM MY CARD and Never answer when you try Cancel. I never used the Services i never saw the classes or how to stsrt perhaps was difficult to find it. But to Pay its So easy and fast. To Cancel they Make you tired trying and failing.,
We subscribed maybe 5 days ago. My daughter has played each day while waiting to pick up her brother. Now today the app stops working. I've restarted my phone but nothing works. This is why we stored using it the first time and I had hoped the issue was resolved.,
"What is wrong with this app?! I literally JUST downloaded it, put in my credit card info just fine and it keeps taking me to a screen to create a profile, but it's not letting me type anything or click anything past that point. I can barely see the screen! Most of the screen is black!",
App just flashes won't even open. Guess I'm paying for nothing! Can't even get in to cancel üò°,
"First time user and the app wont load past the login screen no matter what I try. Cant really rate the app itself since I cant get into it... seems like I'm not the only one having this issue either so maybe the developers need to find out the problem and put out an update to fix whatevers wrong, so that our children can actually use it..",
My experience is with subscribing to the app. I was charged twice. One for the free 30days trial which is $0.01 and also for $19.75 that is for 4months installments. I wasn't aware that the $19.75 would be taken out from my account immediately. People just be careful when subscribing to the app. ABCMouse is Very dodgy app.,
"Waste of time! It showed me offline so I download a US VPN (followed past comments) to address that. But when I can access it, the app loading time is horrendous to as much as 10min even. This is not an issue with our net as we can stream youtube easily with no buffering. UNINSTALLED!",
"My son has complety lost interest. Both the app and the website are so slow, take for ever to load and constantly crash. Every time I say let's play on ABC mouse, he gets upset and doesn't want to use it.",
"It glitches constantly and randomly won't let you continue to the next activity when you push the continue button . It will freeze, or the little loading shapes will get stuck and continue to try and load but won't",
I downloaded the app for my son using his account and immediatly got disappointed. The app won't let me do anything. Once I open the app it takes me to a blue screen and doesn't do anything. I've tried opening the app again and it does the same exact thing. So frustrating.,
"Total scam. Downloaded years ago. YEARS. Cancelled subscription last year but randomly gad a $90 payment come out of my account today. Haven't used the app in well over a year. And again I cancelled my membership. No informed on how to contact people in charge. You charged my card without permission. Have reported you to my card company for fraud. Update: company responded to my public comment, but not my actual email reaching out.",
"I got the free trial for my 21mnth old. Every page loaded quick, even the video loaded within seconds while I was signing up but as soon as I finished my sign up with my card,I went to sign in that all changed. I cant evem get it to load pass the entry of my username and password how am I supposed to cancel. For as much as you spend on advertising your think this app would work great on any device. Don't tell me I need a 4.4 OS. I have the the several OS higher. Ur a scam Fix it right! Then 5‚òÜ",
My 3 year old loves ABC Mouse and has learned so much! I love that it's something we can work on together but she can also learn on her own. The games and activities keep her interested learning and challenge her.,
it use to be okay. now it freezes every 5 min of use and has to.be reset. I know several coworkers that use it and have been having the same issue. I have heard the more you pay the better it will run for you. then they want you to pay extra to see your child's progress.,
"The app is fine, my rating is the fact that I canceled before the trial was over. My 4yo did not show too much interest and stopped playing it. That's why I decided to canceled but for some reason I got charged for this month and it's wasted money since my son won't use it. Unfortunately u don't get an email of cancelation for proof, I went ahead and canceled again. üò§",
"Constantly freezes, getting 504 Gateway error, refreshes itself in the middle of playing the Learning Path...my daughter is level 7, and it keeps putting her back to level 3...uninstalled and reinstalled app, and restarted the device does not help.",
"UPDATED: This app was no longer responding but the problem was fixed within a day without me even having to chat with customer service. I am so grateful, because I have loved this app for years for my kids ages 2-8. I did ABC Mouse instead of preschool for my son and he was at perfect level to start Kindergarten.",
I have seen a huge increase in my daughter's learning and understanding. She will spit off random facts that she's learned and has even be excelling in school. She is 6 and in first grade working on 2nd grade material. Definitely recommend!,
I really like that especially in Dallas Texas last week the winter storm had all the kids out of school. It is like School except much more fun for my daughter. The only thing is when it came time to change the grade level it was hard to get help outside of business hours.,
"My daughter liked it. I didnt like the hidden fees. For instance, I was given a free trial. I was charged $3.95 for using the parent accessments tool. No warning. Why is the tool there with other free tools, and not separate for upgrade items? So you know why or what your getting charged for?",
"Customer service sucks! You don't have control of what your child learns unless you get the ""teacher account,"" which is double the cost of a regular account. The learning is good, but no control over what they learn is unacceptable. There's also no volume control, and the volume is not consistent throughout the app.",
"Our kids, 5 and 4 are really enjoying all the aspects of ABC Mouse during Covid. We use this app daily to continue our skills. Best part my kids don't realize they're learning! Very user friendly, love the colors, sounds, etc.",
"So I just discovered that abc mouse has been charging me for years for a product that my kid hasn't used since she was 8, she's 13 now. I feel stupid for just now finding out but I also feel as though a robbery has occurred. They have algorithms for everything except noticing that your not using their product. No notifications, I would like to think I canceled this 5 years ago but after going through their convoluted process to cancel the subscription, I'm not sure. BEWARE, make sure you CANCEL",
"App doesn't work on Samsung Kids Tablet. My son got a kids tablet for his birthday a few days ago. I wanted to install a learning program on it. I downloaded it initially on my phone for quick set up, but it appears that I cant install it on his tablet which is supposed to be the primary location. I'm doing the annual account, it's a lot of money to not be able to install it for my child. Is there a fix for this? or will I have to cancel the subscription?",
My sons temporarily out if school have a log in and everything but can't use the website. It keeps trying to make me download the app and everytime i try to download it it stops at 70% and cancels its self. He's supposed to be using this for school. My phone has a bunch if room on it and it's not an old phone. Any ideas?,
"Parents. I have been watching abc mouse commercials for years and only just this month bought it. Safe yourself the trouble of regret, buy it today. It has everything your little one will be needing for school presented in an engaging format, easy to navigate webpage! My 4 year old daughter can't wait to take care of her pets. Perfect for home learning during covid, and everyday.",
My daughter loves it. She loves the tickets. Shell im out of tickets got to go play something to win more. It has so many books and games. There a parent feature that you can see how the child is doing. You definitely can't beat it for the price,
"At first it was ok, they ran a promotion saying it's free for the first month but I actually got charged . I let that go,and when my kid got bored I was going to cancel but got a notification that said I wouldn't be charged till july so I figured I'd keep it till July, maybe she will want to pick it up again . But I just got charged today . So,overall I wouldn't get ABC mouse...",
There is no LOGIN tab at the top of the homepage. I can't login to get started using this app. There is an advertising page telling me how to reactivate an account. I have reinstalled and visited the web site still no avail,
If you get locked out of your account they will not help you! this is the absolute worst customer service you'll get in my entire life and I've been customer service for 10 years. They refused to send me a password reset I've contacted them by email and all they give me is a cancellation form. what you have to sign into your account anyway and I told them I can't sign into my account. I'm taking all their emails and what they sent me and putting it on Reddit to show how bad/stupid they are.,
"This app is so horrible! Please before you spend money reconsider, I can't get my $70 payment back and the app takes up tons of space. Then the app has the nerve to never load correctly and have many errors! Horrible horrible! Plus they don't care to fix it. It's about the money and the fact that my daughter really wanted to use this pathetic app",
It won't even let me open the app! I want a refund and my subscription canceled! I contacted support via email and had little to no help. I can't cancel my payments online when it won't even let me open the app and when you use web it only tells you to download the app.,
"Used to work. After renewing membership the app will not work. I have deleted it, loaded again, updated - but it still doesn't work. I have contacted customer support with no response.",
"I love it be because you can do sorts of things and let children more than what they do in school you can write,play learning games,go on the learning path and do art and so much more! It deserves 5 stars!",
My kids love it. Their learning as they explore on it and play games. Its a fun way for them to learn. My oldest graduated from it and is now passed on to his three younger brothers. I defintley recommend ABC Mouse to parents for their child.,
"This app has almost never worked on any device I've used in the past two years, even in my new Samsung S20 5G. I've updated it, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, and it's either does not load it all or takes forever to do so.",
The app is wonderful my toddler loves it but the only issue i have is that i have to keep closing it because it crashes and it won't load. It would be wonderful if it could get fixed.,
"This is the worst app I've ever used, even after reinstall and updates. The developer needs to remove talk back from this app because it suspends other necessary processes. You cannot use the touchscreen whatsoever and it is incredibly difficult to even log in. If it's not user friendly for adults, it certainly is not for kids. Do not recommend",
My kids love this and it keeps them entertained forever and they really enjoy what there doing,
"Just started experiencing crashes, app will open and close.",
Great experience for the kids to learn quickly while having fun.,
App doesn't even open properly so can't log in to even cancel,
App is working again. The kids enjoy playing while learning.,
2.5 years old granddaughter is learning so much from ABCmouse. 100% recommend.,
App no longer works on my Samsung tablet pro after latest update. Just get a blue screen every time opening the app. On another tablet i constantly get the offline screen. Works fine when i log on the desktop though.,
stuck on loading screen when you first open app. haven't been able to use this AT ALL not even once. have Uninstalled and reinstalled. does not work. cannot find an answer anywhere as to how to solve this issue. useless.,
Constant error message when trying to open app,
"Bought it to use on our kindle and its unusable, and when we try to use it on my phone, it isnt much better. Its very glitchy and freezes all the time. I did already send an email, and am currently waiting for a response.",
This is crazy..i cant unsubscribe the app.. i thought it was just so easy to unsubscribe as they say..but its not..i cant cancel it through playstore.. when i check on the parents resources it requires a password when i dont have a password to start with for this app.. this is so ridiculous im always billed without using it..üò° the app is working poorly..,
Downloaded the program and the first thing I saw was a monthly subscription. Nice way to turn people away from the app. Can't be having my 2 year old clicking around on my phone with those types of links available.,
Upgraded app and nothing loads. It's frustrating that I cannot cancel the subscription unless on the app. This may be intentional so ABC mouse can keep charging for services no longer used.,
the app is broken . it minimizes to half the screen but of course it doesnt freeze when it ask you to subscribe . this is terrible my daughter was so excited about it and now she cant even play i want my money back all of the reviews say the same thing & all they tell you is uninstall and redownload thats bs because i have done it 6 times . DO NOT PAY FOR ABC MOUSE THE APP DOES NOT WORK BUT THEY STILL TAKE THE MONEY,
sometimes slow or buggy. i also don't like that they raised the price of the assessment test from $2.99 to $9.99 a Month! that's 3 times more for something i use 1 or 2 time month im already paying $10 month for the subscription now i have to pay $10 more to use the assessment test! also i dont like that you can't customize your child's level he's on level 7 but in math his more advanced since level 7 math is too easy for him. PLEASE GO BACK TO $3 BECAUSE AN ADDITIONAL$10 IS WAY TOO MUCH,
"I can't imagine anyone not loving this app. My daughter has learned how to speak using it! I'm very proud of her and I will gladly sign up for this app if I can afford it. I love the reward system and she loves to pick things out for her animals, avatar, and room. There's so much here it's wonderful. She's 2!",
Downloaded and was able to watch the ad for the free trial with no problems so I signed up but now it won't work. When signing up it asked for a credit card and said to cancel within the first month and I wouldn't be charged. Since I can't get it to work now I can't get in to cancel. Help?,
"Love this app absolutely love ABCmouse but my only problem with it is that it takes too long to load up especially when it comes to the kids lesson, as we all know kiss don't have patience. So if ABC mouse to fix this problem that would be great. Kids pay more attention to the lesson when they don't have to wait too long.",
This is a great app for kids. I got it for my son during this pandemic because his preschool was closed. He has really gotten into it lately. He loves earning tickets to buy more hamsters and pieces for their cage. He is learning a lot along the way. The price isn't bad for what you are getting as long as your kids play it. There are so many games and activities! My only complaint is I wish some of the content was available offline for when we are out of area.,
What a waste of $10... Every video is messed up and glitching. You cant understand anything its glitchy gibberish the first half and the seconds half has no sound at all. Ive uninstalled/reinstalled and nothing fixes it.,
"This app is not good some of the videos don't play you have to watch to many videos to learn about one thing.. I recommend watching dave & ava on YouTube it's very musical, catchy, and you can learn multiple things in one video.. my sister told me about it your welcome... P.s. I would like to cancel my subscription",
"Hasn't been working properly. The learning path doesn't load. And the games don't work either. They need to get it fixed. It's been like this for weeks. I have already tried reinstalling it, it didn'tdo anything. Trying other applications. Do not recommend this one.",
"It's been great for my older three kids, especially through this pandemic. However I also have a preschooler who is eager to learn. Your app only allows for three files so I'm giving only 4 stars because I feel the app needs to be more inclusive of people with large families, especially being a tool for homeschooling.",
"Been cancelling since march. Still charge us monthly. Forces you to download the app to cancel but they keep charging you anyways. I want a refund but we will probably never see the money. Will change my review if refunded. Stay away from this company at all costs, there are far better more customer friendly alternatives.",
Ive spent a nice chunk of money so my son can receive what seemed to be a wonderful way for him to learn how to read write and count. Sadly we cant get past the first screen without the app crashing every single time. Got it for christmas havent been able to use it not once.,
Content is great but let down by buggy app and poor software design. Can't bypass the buggy pages and the kids are forced to start the lesson again from the start. Very frustrating. Better on iPads.,
This is the best app I've found that my granddaughter loves it and she has learned a lot and loves to learn and do the actives and have what we call free time after she does her lessons! I've gotten this when she was 2 years old and now she's 5 and still enjoys it!,
I'm changing my 1 star to a 4. We had a lot of issues right away. Adter putaing around with it started working and we havent had any issues with loading or craahing. The boys love it!,
"The app is great! I love that it incorporates learning into every aspect of it, even the games. There are so many different activities to do and my toddler really enjoys it. Their customer service is also excellent!",
My son loves playing this. He has learned so much in the last few months.,
"Started out great, until they started taking money whenever as much ad they want! They took there monthly fee then 3 days later took 150 more and overdrafts my credit card, can't get ahold of anyone to fix it if you downloaded this app Uninstall it's terrible",
Was working for great but now it doesn't,
"In the beginning this app worked fine on my smartphone. They ""abcmouse company"" sent an email saying they're now available for cellphone use blah say blah. I paid for the year plan in the first two weeks it worked fine all out the blue this app freezes up right in the middle of a lesson it's skipping lessons Will pause for a very very long time. I uninstalled the app then installed it back thinking it'll do justice but NOPE! I'm an unhappy customer. He want's to be on abcmouse learning but can't",
I'm on toddler mode with my 2 year old and there are several suggestions I'd like to recommend from uppercase to lower case letter learning to how the operation system works on coloring. Plus a few more. There should be a suggestions link with correspondence like many online games I play. Ive had my ideas used in several of those.,
"This app now forced it's woke agenda on children under the guise of ""cultural awareness month""...it's gone political! My 3yr old doesn't need to know about anything other than academics, abcs, numbers, letters and colors. She doesn't need to hear about culturally sensitive info.üôÑ I purchased this app for my children thinking it was strictly academic as it professes to be, wrong! Canceling unless they will remove this unnecessary feature.",
"The user interface is awful for the ""Reading"" part. Trying to pause or repeat a paragraph either skips back pages or skips forward the entire book. Absolutely terrible üëé",
"I recently purchased this app while the kids are out of school, I really like that there are alot of things for them to do, however I'm experiencing to many problems with the app freezing. Other then that I'm really enjoying the app.",
Hello I downloaded the app and paid for the hole year and the assessment as well it cost $120. this is a good leaning platform but my child sits there waiting for the it load for so long that she looses interest. It's like every time you change activities it take 1 to 3 minutes to load. The app defenetly needs some work.. If it was faster and dint waste half the time loading it would be great..,
"I got charged twice for a ""free trial"" when signing up then it wouldn't even let me sign in, asked for my payment info again. then I emailed ABC mouse and they told me I have to take it up with my credit card company because they didn't take my money.. well who did?",
can't do anything. just signed up and when i go to get started ( on a laptop ) the screen shrinks to smaller then a phone. yes i have uninstalled and reinstalled still not working. would like help as to why and if cant be helped then please don't charge me anything and cancel my subscription.,
"Paid for a whole year, maybe should have just did a trial and canceled. No customer service when you need them. App gets stuck on certain level and children lose interest. Bubble (1) simply will not pop, should be a parental override to skip to next lesson on learning path.",
My google remembered my login and a message keeps popping up that my email isn't associated with any account. Now I can't login and they keep trying to charge my card every 4 days. I deactivated my card because I can't login. I reactivate it when I need it for something else but that's inconvenient. They have been harassing me since 01/29 and it's now 2/14. Did I miss fine print that it was okay to keep trying to charge my card? My daughter likes this app but it didn't really help her.,
"Activities are neat, but whenever my 4 year old gets to an activity with a video, the video player is unable to play video properly. The video is choppy amd impossible to follow.",
A great learning app; however experiencing technical issues such as app freezing up. I think the app would benefit from limiting the amount of activities as there is an overwhelming amount of activities and can be overstimulating.,
"So far is great, it only needs Spanish education. My daughter's school is dual language so she is learning Spanish and English at the same time. I believe the not loading and Ad problem was before because my daughter was able to do a lot today.",
"PLEASE FIX!! It's getting way too frustrating, and I'm getting ready to ask for my money back. A subscription platform that makes parents and guardians PAY have no real excuse for the awful quality. Its been weeks now, and no real progress with the app constantly crashing and being incompatible with multiple devices. DO NOT PAY FOR OR DOWNLOAD THIS APP NOW. No preparations were made in advance to handle this foreseeable outcome, so now we're all suffering for it.",
"Great content, but is way too slow! The little one loses interest when they have to wait between activities, or wait for things to happen. I am on a 100mbps connection and it is just unbearably slow to load stuff.",
Attempting to download ABCmouse when the installation gets to 100% and says that unable to install ABCmouse here's a list of possible problems and then send feedback it appears that it's a bug could you guys possibly refresh the system or refresh the Mainframe and clear out the bug or clear out the cache a please,
The app would be great if it wasn't constantly crashing. I bought a brand new tablet and this app crashes at least 3 or 4 times an hour. It's obnoxious.,
"I canceled 2 months ago, had email confirmation that said my account was canceled, yet I was charged $9.95 by ABCmouse yesterday. What's the deal?? And no way to talk to anyone with my ""support ticket""/email that I sent to their customer service department being completely ignored. Stupid!!",
This app started playing ads in the MIDDLE of my child's lesson 3 weeks into having a subscription. Why am I paying for a membership if my child has to be interrupted with ads during every lesson? I was very happy with the app the first few weeks but completely disappointed now that ads are playing every few minutes.,
I purchased on my phone and can't download the app. The app on my daughter's phone doesn't work. I'd like to cancel this and can't seem to get the information to do that from the website either. Very frustrated and feel totally ripped off.,
"I've used ABC mouse for all five of my children. They love the games, the songs, and the books. Even my two year old can navigate the app, and I love to use it to supplement my kindergartener and first grader.",
STILL NOT FIXED FOR ANDROID. The issue isn't fixed yet. The app screen is freaking out and I cant do anything. You open it up and some sort of talk back voice says something and it's like the read screen is on on my phone but it's not. And I can't click anything.,
its great when it works. the cerser disappears and sometimes the activities wont load. i gave it 5 stars because my daughter loves it and its a great learning tool especially in this time of quarentine. but please work on getting the bugs out.,
"The kids love abc mouse first off. We like it because the content is fun, engaging, and obviously educational. Yes, you pay for ad free content but when you are talking about subtle information that a child can get into the price is not a question in the matter. Nice job and thank you",
I love the app content but there's definitely a bug as it routinely freezes when trying to move to the next activity in the Learning Path. Super frustrating considering we're paying to use it!,
i deleted and so i thought unsubscribed from this app. Ive been charged now 3 times. Ive looked over my 2 accounts. the app isnt present on either. No subscription link nothing. I've now have had to lock my card. My daughter enjoyed the app for the short months time but no one beats the jungle gym. However Can someone explain this New math to me? Because this mom is going to flunk this assignment.. respectfully. update. im still being charged every month. I will be opting to get all my money,
"Very very slow, crashes way too often.",
"I've had nothing but issues since the sep 15 update. App constantly crashes, freezes, doesn't load task etc. I've had many issues over the last year and very much considering not re subscribing",
This app keeps turning on my screen to talk function that audibly describes everything on the screen. None of my other apps do this. This glitch prevents me from logging on.. any one else have this issue @abcmouse-. Please upgrade your sw or tech support with our hard earned money that we are paying you!,
I've emailed asking for cancelation of my subscription AND refund from the last few months because my child hasnt used it due to not having a device anymore. and here I am 2 months later being charged again. PLEASE CANCEL MY ACCOUNT !!! IM HOMELESS AND CANNOT AFFORD ANYMORE!!,
"It was working fine for my 8yr old, but now it keeps crashing no matter how many times I uninstall it and re-install it. I'm canceling my account. Ridiculous.",
"I've been chared 3 times, and I dont even have the app on any devices. I emailed and canceled subscriptions, and I was still charged. üòï please send back my money!",
I've been trying g to cancel my subscription for months and I can't! I've even undownloaded the app wrote customer service. My doesn't even play anymore. Frustrating.,
I got the download for PC and everything is going fine but it won't let me continue on the path it will not let me play any of the bunny hops games anytime I click on it it just sits on a blank screen it doesn't even load,
My kids love abc mouse. In a world where everything is going to computers it is good for kid to know how to operate the most basic technology we have as well as the other subjects in this app. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that everything has room for improvement.,
This is an amzing app. Extremlt educational for all ages. My 4 year old daughter really enjoys this app. I love seeing her having fun and kearnjng at the same time . it is amazing for children ! I most definetly recomend it. However I do have some issues with the app freezing with my andriod.,
"Some issues, hoping to have them fixed soon so my child can go further. Been stuck on level 3 beach at 82%. The Ostrich section will NOT load. Updated, uninstalled and reinstalled and still stuck. Please fix soon as my child is eager to finish this level!",
"My son has been using this app since he was 2 and its the best learning app out there, because of abc mouse he has always been one step ahead of his class and has had a very extensive vocabulary since a young age. I do and would reccomend this to all parents !!!",
"I really wanted to like this learning app for children, But as stated in MANY other reviews (which begs the question, why hasn't the developers tried to fix this issue with so many of the same complaints, I mean consumers are PAYING for this app) This app LAGS, it is so slow. I have tried it on 4 different platforms including a gaming computer and it still just lags. There are some days (2/7) where it'll load with no lag. Could be a great app for kids. COULD BE.",
"We just started our daughter on ABCmouse this past weekend, she is 18 months and LOVES the pet section and puzzles! We haven't done much more than that, but I can already tell this will help her tremendously! Her sweet face lights up when she the mouse come across the screen!",
"I want to cancel my account with you! I have been paying every month for an app that I haven't been able to use since I registered!!! I reported that the app was messed up and won't stop rotating. I should be getting a refund but, if you will cancel my subscription I won't push this any further!",
"Not Worth It! I signed up for this after it being advertised on my kid's Fire tablets but when I go to the actual play store to download it, it says currently unavailable. So I basically paid 12.99 for something I can't even use. The money isn't the issue, it's the fact that my daughter wanted it and she can't play it. Pathetic!",
DOES NOT WORK ON CHROMEBOOK. So ticked off I just signed up for this app with my payment information and everything and all it does is show a tiny frickin box on my daughters brand new Chromebook! Can't even get the stupid thing to start. What a waste of time!!!!!,
"I used it previously a year ago, but it did not challenge my daughter enough. Somehow, it has mysteriously tried to charge me for a full year now! I'm a single mom so, not that much money in the bank. Congrats for bouncing an e-check and making my bank charge me for insufficient funds!!",
My son is 9 years old and he is in the 3rd grade. His teacher said that he is way behind the reading level thar he is suppost to be on. So the question that i want to know is will it help him to be able to help him read and get up the age level that he needs to be on. Also i wanted to know how much it costs? We live on a fixed income and really dont have that much money but i want to help him out since he has ADHD/ Anxiety/ Depression.,
Very disappointed! I forgot my password and have been trying to get into the parent account and I enter my email to so that I can get the link to reset my password and still have not received the email.I'm still in my trial period which leads me to believe that this is what they do to stop any cancellation before charging an account.,
Horrible experience. I have attempted to cancel the subscription 3 times but they still charge me. I have to cancel my card and report fraud. Not worth it unless you plan on paying forever.,
I have tried many times to update app with no succes. I have also uninstalled it and try to reinstall with no success. I will be canceling this since I just paid for it yesterday. It worked great all last year until recently.,
We were doing level 1 . Farm animation: c . It hung up some many times and wouldn't work. Deleting app or deleting profile did not help. Waste of time. They have resolve glitches like this.,
This app doesn't work... Not on my tablet. Not on my phone. Not on any of my three computers.... It's stupid and really frustrating for my kids. It used to work really well... Now I'm canceling my subscription due to the frustration.,
This app is very slow! I've tried to use this on several devices and different locations still the same. My son has lost interest. I've paid 120 for this so far. My opinion it's trash!,
Mobile app loses connection often and won't work offline. Aggravating that I paid subscription and can't use on the tablet. I have no problem streaming videos or other games on the tablet so it is not the internet connection,
Fun easy to apply. The app has many subjects. Fun puzzles on many levels. Math fun and entertaining coins earned fun shopping spree. Earning the coins add up as you apply or use. So much packed into this teaching tool.,
"I played this game when I was like 3. I worked for months to advance to the ocean area, and do you know what I got for my hard work? Nothing. A new background with the same problems. I would personally punch every single person who designed this game. I go into a blind fury whenever I hear it spoken, and please don't use this app",
"Hi, Had issue in reset the password, had subscribe yesterday and parent control time setting issue in reset the password. Uninstalled 2 time and reinstalled, but then as also the same issue!! I don't no in future how many times have to face the issue, but I liked the kids program have more activities.",
"I'm sorry to say, I have not yet signed up for this app due to SOOOO many bad reviews! I was so close to ordering, especially due to my grandchild not having classroom time right now,but definitely scared off by the number of reviews complaining about technical problems and lack of customer service response. I just don't have the patience for that. Too bad for everyone who feels ripped off. Thank you for saving me the trouble and frustration. Have to rate to post,so 1 star as opposed to none..",
"I swear I purchased a years subscription but it's only been 8 months and we are locked out without notice. I contacted customer service who refused to give me my purchase info unless I renewed the account. I said that had unethical implications and they offered to give me info if I give them the card I used 8 months ago. That was 8 months ago, I don't know which card it was. What kind of company hides what you purchased? Terrible company and customer serv. I will never purchase again.",
"Waste of time and money, this app is slow, it crashes consistently, and loses connection every 3 minutes I spend more time trying to fix the app then my daughter does actually using it.",
I paid almost 60 dollars for this program. Download it it to my androi and my pc and it usually never doesn't opens. When it does open it crashes with in 10 minutues. I'm very annoyed.,
"A ton of good activities, but no way to prevent kids from leaving the app or restrict/limit which activities your kids can do (for example, my son would skip learning activities and goes for the videos, or could spend a full hour playing with his pet cat in the app), meaning I have to activitely monitor them and make sure they stick to the learning path. Also, that NO activities are available offline makes this USELESS on an airplane, for something that already takes ages to load every activity",
It is a good application but it freezes alot and takes so much time to move from one thing to another...too much time to load anything and even longer to respond to our action!!,
the only thing that would make the app better is easier personalization. I wish I could keep my child on the learning path for a period of time before he is allowed to start playing games or watching music videos.,
Never loads!! Freezes all the time!! Good concept.. will not pay for this when you cant get on it ever. Not even when you try to log in online can we get in.. the things in the app and games were great the 1 time we could get on. But for the price this app neefs to be fixed.,
"I paid for the full year and cant even get into the app to log in , tried on several device and nothing . We've been with you guys for a while and never had such problems before . I tried to message the feedback center but they just told me to uninstall and try again . Very disappointing .",
Absolute awful app! I couldn't log in back in September after I purchased the app. I can understand do to the novel virus outbreak. Two to three days later same deal so I canceled. Or so I thought. It charged me the next month and now the following. I've paid 30 dollars for nothing but a head ache. Abc mouse is a racket,
"My daughter loves ABC mouse, we both have fun playing the songs and games. It's very impressive how she's learned things far beyond majority of children her age. Love this (creative, and fun for a reasonable priceüëèüíï) learning app!",
Love it! My 3 year old and my 7 year old use it and learn so much!,
App continuously crashes on my phone anytime it's opened. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and made sure the app was up to date. Not working.,
"(Edit, the app is working again, thanks!!) The app worked wonderfully, until it started crashing constantly. Now it can't even be opened, and my paid subscription is going to waste.",
"$10 usd a month just to use which ok given amount of content which u can adjust difficulty on the fly which is nice. Problem 1 $100 for assessment to see childs progress a main feature that caught my eye this looks automated so why so much? Problem 2 there is no ability to prevent child from going to store and making small purchases charged to credit card, u can auto prevent spending tickets but not cc purchases why? Seems money hungry. Also improve buffering icon visibility plz",
"I unsubscribed and even deleted the app and it still charges me! I've read about this problem before, but thought they have already fixed it, but no! I guess, that's how they make money. So how do I stop the payments, when it's not even in my subscriptions? I hate spending my time on things like that!",
I would love to give it five stars but it continues to either be super slow and/or it crashes. It is a great app and ny 2 years old loves it but the issues are making hard to enjoy it especially with an inpatient toddler,
"Can no longer log in to the app, when greeted with the login page nothing works, it won't let me enter my credentials or press any of the page buttons. Everything seems to work fine on the sign up section just not the sign in.",
This app is great! I have it on my iPad. Its great if you sit down with your kid everyday as well as leave him do it on his own. If you are lazy or busy and leave your kid on his own it won't work out as good for you unless your kid is a little bit older.,
"Amazing app... My 7yr old is autistic, and loves being able to learn at her own pace. May not mean much to some, but it's so amazing to see her talk with the games, and actually knows 2 colors now and 2 numbers and 3 shapes... She has a really hard time remembering things and this app truly helps her with that. üíï",
Too Slow ands lags on all devices I attempt to use it on. I will be demanding a refund of my money if this is not fixed. You keep responding to other similar concerns that you will look into their accounts when it is a tech issue on your part. Fix this or give me a refund!,
"This is an easy app. My 2 yeast old, who was never allowed to play with electronics before ABCmouse, quickly and easily picked up how to navigate the app. Amazing program!",
"Love it. I have had the app for a year now and love it. My 4, 2 and 18 month old all love the app. They are learning while playing. From a kids perspective it does hurt one of my daughters that her name is not said at the welcoming of the app. My other 2 kids have their name said. So for them that is a no no.",
"If it would work right I would like it but all we do is wait for things to load. The songs don't play, and everything takes so long my kids are over it!:( I've tried to cancel and was told Google play had to do it they wouldn't don't cancel it for you. Don't download it it's not worth it",
"I contacted ABC mouse in March because my daughter lost her phone and couldn't remember her log in. I have sent them every bit of information they asked for over the last 3 months. Today March 23rd I received emails from 3 different people. Miraculously after I told them I would contact my bank, 30 minutes later I receive an email stating they found her log in information and that they have cancelled the account and sent a 2 month refund. I never asked to cancel my account or receive a refund!",
My 4 year old was so excited to learn and play the games on this app.unfortunately it took forever to load and he really didn't get a chance to use it very much.it was very disappointing for me to see him anxiously wait just looking at the little symbols just going in circles.what a waste of time and money.Hopefully they get the situation fixed quickly for it seems like a really good app!,
I downloaded this app on a brand new tablet so I know it isn't the device. It constantly freezes and requires to be restarted. Very frustrating and a waste of money.,
"My little girl loved this app. However, even though I am still being charged monthly for this app, it has failed to work at all for months. The app loads to a white screen and nothing ever happens after this point. Have tried everything. Want a refund at this point.",
"The app, itself is really slow and freezes a lot. The page would randomly turn off or go back to the main page. I would not recommend.",
Very Very helpful 4 my child,
Everything is fine its just that the learning path freezes the game so you have to restart it everytime! Other than that there seem to be no bugs.,
We are stuck in an infinite loop of being charged $10 and $3 every month with no way of stopping it. We've canceled subscription we got new cards and still being charged. Don't do it.,
"Don't even want to give this a star but have to im unable to use the app wont work for me on my phone and online all am getting is a subscription message when I registered for a free trail i haven't bn on the app once to see how it is and I have had money taken for the use of this app ive emailed them about the problems in having and I've had no response so I called the number provided it isn't even their no, they cant even email me back probably isn't their email.",
"I don't recommend that anyone waste their money on this. It's almost impossible to use the app, I liked to try and see what my girls was doing, and even using the website on my browser was no better. My girls did use it, they complained always about how they would try to open the app on their tablets and would not be able. They would only be able to do anything when using the school issued Chromebooks. I am going to cancel this immediately after writing this. What a waste of my money...",
"I loved it for my son. Everything was working fine when I was paying monthly. A couple of weeks after I got a yearly subscription it started acting up, now it won't even load up. Now it keeps saying error failed to extract resources needed by ll2CPP. Not happy I'm paying for something he can't use",
cannot log in. there is a voice over talking about something disabled and using talk back in web view. paying for an app that haven't been able to use in months. I've tried everything to try and get it to work and nothing.,
This app is very slow at responding. It constantly freezes up and take forever to load. It will say choose next activity before the activity page even pops up. I would like a refund.,
"I bought ABCmouse for my 5 and 7 year old daughters, it's okay but a little to repetitive. The app keeps pausing/getting stuck on the same spot this has happened multiple times I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app or getting on the computer to fix it.",
Was going really well until I was hovering above my child one day and seen that it still gives credit for wrong answers. So really what's the point? The art and reading stuff though is pretty cool. Not 10$ a month cool but to each their own.,
"I paid for the app. Then soon after it lags when loading up. It doesn't keep me logged in, and it doesn't work even after restarting my phone. I've uninstalled and installed the app. I would like a refund. I feel like I was scammed.",
Terrible app. My son didn't really care for it so I deleted the app and I am still getting charged and tried to cancel my subscription and even went through another app to cancel my subscription and even they couldn't do it. I hate that they are taking $13 from my account every month for something I don't use,
Can't even open the app. I wrote an email asking them to delete my account.. and credit information. I'm waiting to hear back . My son was so disappointed. My phone computer and tablet couldn't open it ... I couldn't even get on the cancel subscription,
My kids love ABC mouse and loves learning even more. Although when were on the go or somewhere that doesnt have wifi my son absolutely loves playing the offline videos provided. I was wondering if its possible for new or more videos? Or even some offline activities? Overall a great app though. Thanks ABC mouse!,
"Most of the time, this app is awesome. But, since updating, it won't open. It tries to open, and when it gets to the loading screen, it goes back to the home screen on my phone.",
"Super disappointed. I can log in but then nothing will load, it doesn't matter what device I'm on. My daughter has been asking all day to get on ABCMouse and I have to keep letting her down. I'll change my review if we can actually use this app soon. If not, I'll be cancelling my subscription.",
"Don't waste you money. As others stated...constantly freezes, can't log in consistently, times out. Uninstall and reinstall sometimes helps, sometimes. Absolute junk",
I have a paid subscription and have been unable to log in for months. I haven't been able to contact customer support and I'm hoping they'll send a link after this review. UPDATE Quick customer service. And my issue is resolved. Thank you so much!,
"Nothing about this app works. Very disappointed. Error messages, pages stuck, sound doesn't work. It's more of a constant headache then enjoyable.",
This is what is wrong with the world today. Uninstalled as soon as i seen the price. Intelligence or learning comes with a price tag. Was just trying to help my 2 year old get ahead a little but will look elsewhere. Im sure there are plenty that cost nothing or next to nothing. If people were less greedy and shared more like we all were taught growing up then the world would be a better place.,
"We love the ABC Mouse website & activities. The app takes up a lot of space, and doesn't respond very quickly. Often my son will lose patience with the constant ""Loading"" symbol on the app & start doing something else while he's waiting. I wouldn't mind the space if the app responded as fast as the website. I still have 17 GB avail. We use the website version when possible. * I HAVE tried ininstalling and reinstalling the app. * Even tried app and website on same Chromebook. Website IS better.",
This app has a lot of potential. It works so well for a few steps on the learning path then freezes or the screen goes blank. I'm not happy and neither is my 4 year old son,
"Beyond annoyed with this app. With kids out of school right now, I decided to give this a try to keep my kid busy while learning. But the app freezes and I can't get into it. So it's basically useless. A total waste!!!!!",
The only thing I can't stand is to get out of any area you have to press back through every previous area. It is very hard for a toddler to navigate it.,
I've had this app for less than a month. When it doesn't freeze we like it. But my sun can't even do the lessons. Something is wrong with the app and it constantly freezes.,
My preschooler loves this app. Getting his avatar dressed. Doing the activities and everything. Just realized though that I can make a shortcut to my home screen from the web. Oops. That's didn't work still live it though. 2player games are the best. I get to interact with him while he learns. He's in 1st grade now and still loves it. And it was a plus during schooling at home for a boost. Worth it.,
"I used to love this app, but when you stop using it, it just makes you log in again. and if the password or email does not work then you will have to do the free trial and then pay the app again if you can change this please do it. thank you.",
"This app is extreamly buggy & crashes. We thought maybe it was our sons Amazon Fire Tablet until we replicated the same issues repeatedly on a new Galaxy tablet. Additionally the app spams to use the abcmouse app, while playing it. As well constantly requests we review it, a child uses this app, why spam your review requests to a child.",
"somtimes it freezes for an entire day so that is very annoying, but for the most part this App has helped my daughter out with her learning abuilitys. the only other thing i can say is that i believe that when a child completes his or hers learning path that they should automatically graduate to the next grade, i say this because my daughter whime is in 1st grade, flew threw the kidergarten one after this summer and then wasnt sure wat else to do, until i went online and figured it out, thanks",
"Great app. Great activities to do, when it works! It has so much potential and it can be so educational and useful, but its always freezing/not loading /glitching/lagging.",
I just paid for the app and its freezing before we can even get started. OmG I dont like to waiste money and i should have read the reviews before paying for the yearly subscription. I didnt read the reviews because ABCmouse is great!!!..... I'm only hoping things get better so my 6yr old can begin to have fun learning on this app,
It makes NO SENSE that I HAVE to download the app when I go to the site from my cell! There should be an option for the full website available to mobole users!! Not everyone wants to download new apps to their device THUMBS DOWN for making EVERYONE download your app to increase the number of downloads.,
DO NOT GET THIS APP ITS A SCAM!!!!! I got this cause it was one of the offers I had to do in order to get a $100 gift card well when I realized that I'm not getting a gift card I tried to cancel it told me that I have to download the app if I want to cancel so I tried to download the app and it won't download it will get too about 73% then crash I have plenty of space I did what it said if you guys at ABC mouse are reading PLEASE CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION and stop trying to get money off my card,
How do I cancel this subscription I've been trying for a few days just found out it renewed without my knowledge and since my son hasn't played with is in Over a year I would like my money refunded for it happened a few days ago I've been going through the steps but it won't cancel great app but my son isn't interested in it at all right now someone if you can please help or direct me into someone who could would be greatly appreciated thank you in advance,
"Abc mouse make's it impossible to cancel your subscription with them!! People please please make sure that your checking your bank statements after canceling with them as I was still being fully charged for close to 7 1/2 months after canceling my subscription with this company!! BE AWARE, BE AWARE, BE AWARE.... It is illegal for Companies to make it difficult for customers to cancel their subscription it is illegal for them to make customers go through hoops",
Just signed up on the computer for my 3 yr old. I then tried to put the app on my phone cause she doesn't know how to use a mouse yet and it won't bring up the keyboard to sign in. This is a new phone that I got yesterday and none of the other apps had any problems signing back in.,
Super helpful in learning and growing!,
The app is really slow or heavy to load. Every screen or mini game takes at least 10 seconds to load and that for my 2 year old is too much. I paid 1 year subscription but now I regret it with many other great free games out there,
"It's a great learning game experience for young children to learn how to read, write, spell, count, and learn colors. I most definitely will recommend this learning App to any of my friends and family with young children.",
This app would be wonderful if it actually ever worked. It constantly freezes and crashes to the point where both my child and I gave up on it entirely. :(,
just downloaded the app and enter all the info they ask for as well as my credit card info and once it was time to go to the learning apps the screen was all mess up I tried refreshing it but didnt work therefore I'm just going to cancel the whole thing.,
"For some reason the app isn't loading on my daughter's tablet. When we first signed up and downloaded, it worked fine. Now not even close. We've updated the app with no success.",
"Warning, warning, and warning. I need my money back ASAP. I downloaded this app in January for my toddler, and i tried it for about 4 days. My daughter didn't like that much. I decided to cancel the subscription and deleted the app, but it still charges me.üò† üò° I need all my money back.",
I have been unable to open and use this app consistently for at least 6 mo. I try periodically on multiple devices and it doesn't work. I can't even log in.,
The app is terrible. We've only had our tablet a year or so and it lags horribly and often won't load. So disappointing to pay the subscription and hardly get to use it!,
It's the best game I love it so much I'm super easy and my favorite part is the little trail thing we had to go and to move up you have to learn something and it makes all the games movies and books fun and they teach you,
"I can't even complete the setup without being bombarded with offers to upgrade. The app also keeps freezing......I wish I read previous reviews before I subscribed to this, really regretting it!",
"My 17 year old daughter started with ABC mouse. She suggested it to everyone. We're still using it my 2 youngest. One who hates school, but loves ABC mouse.",
Took forever for me to figure out how to cancel my subscription. Had it for quite sometime and contacted the support email and never heard back. So I am out several months of subscription fees.,
i downloaded the app for my children due to the virus and schools being canceled. but they cant even use it it freezes up on the home page. i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still does the same thing.,
it makes learning so fun for Mason. He loves to learn and play on the app. its helped him so much with Learning his colors (which he struggled with alot) and recognizing Letters and Numbers is what we are working on right now. And writing letters. it's an amazing tool aid and absolutely worth the money.,
"My daughter loves it, she is just about to start preschool so we have been using ABC mouse to prepare, it's working wonders and my little girl is so smart!!!!!! Love watching her learn and grows, we do it in the mornings with our breakfast üòä",
"Why am I naming hampster? I gave 2 stars based on OUR experience. Ex. I was not able to slide screen so I could select proper learning level for each of my chidren. Program/App might be great for young children (like 6 or younger) Our son is 10 (4th Grade) and our daughter 12 (6th grade), attending an academy - so the ""child like"" or ""baby talk"" on most of the videos was not something they said they could sit through.",
This app is one of the best apps out there for teaching children and allowing development as they reach goals. The only down fall is it is very exspensive for most parents of preschool age.,
"Extremely frustrated. I got this app for the kids to use during Covid-19, and there is no school. I cannot get it to work. We just got brand new chromebooks. All I can get is a tiny little screen that will not let me click on anything. What am I doing wrong, if anything? I believe I paid for a whole year, so if this doesn't work, I would like my money back.",
"I can't download any of the apps on my phone for learning on the go but I was able to log in on our home computer and set up a profile for all of my kids. I am satisfied now, however if you could create the app to be able to function on all android apps you would get more satisfied customers.",
"Very very slow. I'm so frustrated with this app. It loads up so slow and it takes so much time in between activities. My granddaughter would much rather play the free apps I downloaded. I keep trying to steer her to this app but even I get inpatient with how slow it is. Worst of all, I feel like I wasted money because she doesn't like the app.",
"Stopped working. The third activity on the learning track will not work ... There doesn't seem to be a way to bypass it to get to the next activity, and the customer support doesn't work. We can still do random activities, but my child was very excited to work on the track and earn prizes which, at the moment, don't seem to be available.",
I just paid for this subscription then downloaded the app. It takes me to where i can log in but I can't type in my email or password!!! Why?? It shouldn't be that difficult since it's an app for kids. The app literally won't allow me to type anything so i can get logged in... very frustrating!,
I just signed up and downloaded the app and after downloading its not letting open a full screen its asking me questions to fill out my info but its not letting me input anything and after reading some of the other reviews I see why if you know your app has problems fix them before you try to get customers to keep signing up and charging money for an app that they can't even use I would like to use the app but if the problem is not fixed you can cancle my order your app is not working at all,
Why am I paying for something... That my kids cant enjoy? Each step takes forever to upload. And now I have been loading a page thats been 3 minutes now!!!! Really upset about paying for something that can help educate my children YET THE APP DOESNT LOAD!!!!.... ANYWAY TO FIXTHISPROBLEM? ...... Oh and dont blame the freezes on high useage of ppl on the app... Thats BS... I downloaded in January.... Before the outbreak of COVID-19.... It was still slow... In frozed every 3 minutes...,
The programs seem great but it runs so slow and freezes constantly! My son isnt even Interested because of the slowness. Glad I have a free trial. Try scholastic books they have 20 days free of activities and books due to COVID-19,
"Really bad service. They automatically Bill my account even though I have set to not auto renew. Not a trust worthy entity, bad form. Learning content are from the 90s. Not much value for my kids learning 90s content and UX/UI",
Won't open properly on brand new chromebook. Screen shifts to some small corner and you are unable to resize or do anything. Also can't access any help (because it is cut off on the screen).,
"My daughter and I love this app, she loves playing the games and I love that she is learning and they it shows me everything I need to know about her Progress and her way of learning. I'm homeschooling so this definitely helps on days when I'm struggling with patience. I like that I can hand her the ""game"" and know she's progressing. It also helps her in areas where I struggle teaching. This app is amazing.",
Plenty of free apps that are much better than this. I saw lots of ads for this apps and eventually gave it a try. Complete waste of money. It's kind of boring and lame. Doesn't challenge in a fun and creative way. Don't waste your money.,
Its too slow to be of any use and I'd like to cancel my subscriptions. There is no way a 3 year old can be expected to wait so long for the app to load. I found it extremely frustrating. Worst user experience.,
Games turned into learning. It helps with critical thinking and understanding letters colors and numbers better. Great app for little ones who haven't been in school yet.,
"My son really enjoys the app, although I think the predicted level by age might be a bit lower than the Irish education standard. The app can be slow to load but it doesn't bother me too much... I guess it helps with learning patience",
The app will have so much more potential if they will fix the bug for every hour spent on abc mouse your child will only get about a good 15 minutes because the game freezes and then won't load so you spend majority of the time rebooting the app I have reached out to them and no response so if I was you I would save my money. I bought a whole year subscription and still get no customer service so I'm upset feel like I should be refunded,
"I downloaded it for my 5 year old on my tablet, ABC mouse had a special of a month free so I thought, why not, but since I've downloaded it, it won't get anywhere past the yellow ABC mouse screen! Is that because I wanted the free month, that's what happens I guess. They hope you'll give them your CC info for the free month and forget about it cuz it dosent work...that's not okay",
I am a long time user and homeschool family. I started ABC mouse with my oldest at 2 and now 9. It help him get the head start he needed. I now use it with my 3 & 4 year old who beg to use it everyday. They love to learn and how they can work independently to a point. We love ABC mouse.,
Abcmouse is HORRIBLE!  I've tried to cancel my acount several times and all it does is shift me back n' forth from abc mouse website and then open in the Google play app......I can't even log into the thing without it directing me open the app somewhere different......HORRIBLE !!!!! Stop charging me......!!!!!!,
"When the app or site works it has great content. But, both the website and apps constantly lag or just crash. It makes not patient children not want to use the product.",
"My daughter loves abcmouse! She was prepared for kindergarten and now beginning to see what 2nd grade stuff is like. She's challenged and always interested in the new levels, not to mention has a ton of fun with her avatar and animals!",
I absolutely love ABC Mouse and so does my little guy. He loves playing all the games and i adore that he is learning through the play. We were playing Uno and he saw my cards and identified the numbers. Such a fun surprise. I am more than happy ro let him play and learn!,
"Nearly impossible to cancel. Got this program for my son. You must have the app downloaded in order to cancel, which is not compatible with my phone. My childs tablet, where the app had been downloaded is lost. So I need to buy a whole new device and continue getting charged for an app my son can't use. There's only one reason a developer would not allow for browser friendly account maintenence...... How can you cancel without access?",
"My son is 4 and loves this program. We are Canadian users and have had no issues at all using the app. The only wish I had was that you could access the ""how my child is doing"" information without having to pay another $99 USD a year on top of the subscription fee.",
"I subscribe to ABCmouse and up until now we have no access, we tried using the tablet, phone, laptop etc. But yet still it comes on very well on my desk top computer at work. I am in Jamaica by the way. We getting really frustrated. We downloaded the App and it keeps giving us the 'you are offline message'. Please guide us into what to do etc.",
"I like the learning activities and being able to set up multiple profiles for all my kids. It is a great app for learning and fun. But, it does lock up almost every time we use it.",
I can't even get the app to open! Not to mention when you sign up they have so many extra buy pop ups that I got charged almost 60.00 instead of 9.95 for something that I can't even use!!,
"The app does not work. Freezes and boots you right back out. For paying so much money, the app should work. I may cancel my subscription just because the app is not working. There's no point in paying if we can't use it.",
"Very disappointed. It turns out that this app is only free for the first month. After that, you have to try to cancel your subscription. And from the sounds of it, that isn't easy to do. So instead of trying this app, I chose to delete it without trying the free trial. This shouldn't be listed as ""free"" in any way.",
Application kept freezing my device. had to keep literally shutting down and restarting my whole computer. Waste of time. please fix this issue or I will have to end my subscription.,
It's got to much going on. Nothing is really categorized as described. After I finally find something for my son to play he quickly gets bored and I have to sift through the endless of random games and uninteresting songs.,
I read that it had content in Spanish and that is the sole reason why I subscribed. Turns out the display can be turned to Spanish but the content is mostly in english so I personally do not find use on it.,
I had already deleted this app and it hadn't taken out anything in months now it takes out 10$ without permission and my card had 6$ on it so that put me in the red. My card does not have overdraft! Yet u were still able to take my money and when I said something about it all u guys did was cancel my membership u can't even give me my money back,
"App is slow, frustrating, and crashes. Just use the laptop or desktop because no child is going to sit waiting for an exercise to load for five minutes just to freeze upon completion over and over",
I gave app three stars because when I went to go cancel my subscription it took me to a cancellation page but then it had another offer for you to put in your password but I made the mistake of thinking that you had to put in your password to cancel the subscription I put it in and accidentally purchased another subscription that I did not need nor want I did not need nor want this app and I would love it if you guys please get back to me and I'd love this transaction to be reversed immediately,
I loved this game at first but now the learnings path is stuck on level 5 the 14 lesson it will not load on any phone we have and it won't load from where my daughter feeds her pets. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It's kinda crappy that I paid for the whole year now it will not work.,
ABC mouse is great and fun for my children. The app is just like the computer version only you can use your finger to trace and draw instead of the mouse. I am very pleased!,
just paidfor the app won't even download on my phone. you need to work on updating your app to work better. if fortnite updates all the time. I'm sure you can put some work in to it. it has 10 mill plus downloads. and seems you haven't worked on your app or piece!! shame on you!!,
"I'm not a happy camper! I just bought my granddaughter a Nabi Big Tab Android tablet. Bought ABC Mouse service for a year, installed it on the tablet and discovered that the login screen goes blank every time I try to log in. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program several times, to no avail. I'm not happy right now and neither is my granddaughter! The tablet runs Android 4.4.2",
Complete waste of money couldnt even get to play with all the upsell content and did 20 recaptcha verifications to no avail. There are so many better apps free that dont want all you family history and life information... if the app was that good they wouldnt need to lock you in to a lifetime subscription before you even tried it! IF my son loved it i would happily pay for it but i dont trust them when you cant even try without signing your life away,
"I don't like how it says in app purchases, so I thought there would be something that I could do to try, I don't know if my child is quite ready for this yet, but I can't do anything without a credit card üòî maybe give a free sample without the need for a credit card or make people sign up before downloading ,because now I have to uninstall, my time is valuable",
"This app worked great for over a month, but now we constantly get an offline error even though we are on WiFi and all other apps work. Reinstalling is only a momentary fix. Now I'm stuck paying for something we can't even use.",
This is the only way my son will engage in anything educational. ABC Mouse designers definitely know their stuff! Definitely worth the cost and then some- Highly recommend at least trying it out and then purchasing the yearly as it saves you money and so worth it!,
natalee who 2 years old has used abc mouse for about 6 weeks now because she was almost non conversive with actual words. natalee would point to what she wanted and was referred to an outside agency by our pediatrician. that is why i putchased abc mouse. to our pleasant surprise she was formally released from the cerebral palsy's early intervention program last week. the cp people came to her daycare twice a month and we were told that she would be in this program for at least 12 months! thanks!,
I'm pretty disappointed. This app was at the top of my daughter's Christmas list and she isn't even playing it because it doesn't work. It freezes constantly and some of the videos wont even play.,
"My son loves ABC mouse. I love different activities, though I think that the lessons on his lesson path are repetitive. The designers could bring a bit more excitement to the activities, he gets bored and tries to click on other activies, he loves the movies too. He is 2yrs old now, I will watch to see how much he sticks to it.",
Absolutely horrible freezes constantly my son was able to make in app purchases without knowledge should be safe for kids. It also makes it very hard for your phone to leave the app. Weird . Don't recommend,
Has a really hard time loading. Sometimes I have to completely shut down the app and reopen it because its frozen or wont load an activity. By the time I get it up and running again my toddler is wanting to do something else,
"What a rip off Same complaint as every one else, paying customer, unable to login on my phone. You charge way too much for this app to be this bad at fixing your app. Won't be renewing my payment and will not recommend. Get it together.",
"We are stuck! We like the app a lot, my 4 years old is learning and enjoying. But, we suddenly got stuck at pre-k level 4, an activity called abc blocks upper case, this activity opens a blank page, no activity so we can't pass it! My son started at level 3 when we first subscribed he passed it and started level 4 and was excited but now he is stuck, please help?",
"My child has learned so much with abcmouse, the only problem I have is not being able to pull it up good on her tablet good. So I've been paying a monthly fee and less use. It's hard to cancel online but if you call them they are ready to help in any kind of way to make sure the customer is satisfied.",
"Almost impossible to cancel. The content is alright but why not let it speak for itself(rather than using entrapment)? Out of general principle, I will never use this app again. There's already enough stress in all of our lives... nothing is worth voluntarily adding more. FOR SHAME ABCmouse!",
"I had this app before for pre-k prep, now we are kindergarten. Now I am back to re-activate due to school closing due to corona and it keeps freezing and crashing. I guess I am off to find a different solution to education for my child, thought this would be a quick nice solution.",
Not working at all,
"My daughter loves this app! But at every log in(on my tablet), it changes my ""1"" to an ""l"" which makes my log-in incorrect. I know my username and password, but when I hit the Submit, it changes my email address and I am unable to sign in correctly. Please correct this issue. Thank you!‚ò∫",
"I love this site for my child. She learns so much and has since she was 2. She didn't go on it very much when she was younger, but she is about to be in kindergarten and she has been more than prepared for over 2 years thanks to ABCMOUSE! :)",
"Love this ABCmouse app..I've used it for my son whom is 8 , since he was born. Now my 4 year old daughter since last year ,and they absolutely enjoy it.It helps me have to teach less and actually be able to do my work..yay!! lol I've been recommending this app to lots of parent for a long time and will continue. Five thumbs up ABCmouse!",
"Granddaughter was in middle of kindergarten when covid 19 closed her school. Don't want her to forget what she already learned. She loved playing games on our phones and tablet, so this is a perfert way for her to maintain and even advance her pogress. She loves it!",
"Works as expected and a bit easier for kids who are use to tablets vs computers. I especially love how it says the child's name when they log in. Like I actually says "" welcome back Liam!"" Audibly. My daughter was having issues remembering what letters were what and now she can recognize them easily. She's also learned to pronounce a few words properly",
"I Have been using this app for my boys for how many years now (5 or 6 years). They worked great on all our gadgets. My boys are happy that ABCmouse added Disney and Pixar books recently. This app does not deserve one star, that is very unfair for such a useful apps. I just wish that more game would be available offline.",
"Pretty upset with this app so far. We've been wanting so sign up for a long time. Finally did it and of course you can easily sign up on the app but It won't allow me to LOG IN to the app the use it. So, I can't even cancel it!!!!!!!!!!!! Unless I figure it out today, I'll be telling everyone I know to stay away from this app.",
"I used to love this app but I think it's time to cancel my subscription.. my kid gets so frustrated not being able to use certain features or play certain games.. she just told me her tears are raining on her because she loves this app so much but the app ""doesn't want her to play anymore."" What's going on!?",
So far I can get in touch with them. Through their fake phone number or by chat so if you are asking for a refund it appears they ignore you.tge app doesn't engage well and it's constantly claiming that I have the wrong password. I'm on the verge of cancelling the entire thing and going elsewhere,
I'm totally blown away by how much my son is into it!He missed Pre-K because of covid and he has a language delay so it not only helps with his speech but I feel like he's obtaining Pre-K Education. I strongly support any parent to get this app and it's definitely worth the $12.99 a month or the $60 a year! It does crash on his Fire HD but no issues on my Samsung Tablet or his phone and that's why the 4 ‚≠ê rating.,
You should really stop showing your ads all of your ads are fake. The kids on the ads dont even look interested at all. if I had kids I wouldn't even show abc mouse to them and adventure academy i remember when i was younger i used abcmouse and it did not help with my education at all.,
Pissed off Says my log in and password aren't existant when they are and I've got the emails and the same password for this app yet I can't access the app I've been charged already to use this app I know I've put the correct info in your app is bugging out and saying my email doesn't exist when it does and I have the password reset emails to and here's the kicker I clicked the link I wasn't given the option to UPDATE the password even though I know for a fact I put it in right. Disappointed!,
Terrible! This app was used as part of a scam by so called NCC to get information from me. I was supposed to win $1000 . Installing this app was required to win. Now I have all kinds of spam/advertisements and questionnaires beeping my phone constantly and didn't get my gift card! Awful!!!,
From experience I can say the best way to deal with this company is to file a fraud complaint with your bank. There's a reason you pay monthly charges on your credit card. It is to deal with scammers like this. Edit: their level of customer support is evident in their ability to only ever reply with canned responses.,
"Waste of money.Stopped working after few days of use. It just keeps repeating voice message""stop talkback during play"" although accessibility settings are off. Very disappointed.",
Good idea. Terrible execution. So buggy and slow. My toddler was into it until he got so frustrated with it that he gave up on it. Stuck on level 4 lesson 2. Now stuck on Learning Path 4 - Letter G on the fence. This app is terrible.,
"Signed up for free 30 days on the website after my daughter saw her friend playing it and just had to have it. After trying several times to download it on 2 different devices, closing the play store and opening it back up, and power cycling, the app just will not download past 70%. I was really looking forward to liking this app and possibly having a little bit of quiet time....not today. Any suggestions? If anything changes I will definitely update my review.",
This app is NOT working. Took my $$ no problem though. As soon as it tells you to go to the white board it closes down. I've Uninstalld and re installed..same glitch. If your going to charge for a educational game- someone needs to learn how to fix the issue,
Not only does my kiddo love the app and truthfully does learn a lot but they are great about the trial and an easy cancellation if you decide it's not for you I cancelled and then changed my mind and decided to pay for the subscription it's definitely been worth it to see her grow.,
"I was looking forward to this app for my kids, but it's almost impossible to use, it's suuuper slow and it gets frozen all the time, very dissapointed, will keep using hoping for that issue to be solved.",
"I love this and my son, 6, my daughter, 2, also love this but my daughter notices every time she plays it that it doesn't say her name like it says her brother's name. My daughter is now 4 and the problem still hasn't been fixed. I have reached out to customer support twice and submitted a name greeting request both times.",
"Waste of money. It is always frozen and saying that it is offline, which I am not. I am now trying to cancel it and they don't make it easy to do so... may have to report fraud on my credit card to get it to stop. So disappointing amd frustrated.",
I think it's a good app for kids nice üëç,
"The service / program is 5 stars The APP is 1 star or 0 stars because I have to ALWAYS uninstall then reinstall in order to use it. Once installed, if I don't login for a few days, I get the yellow screen of doom and the login never appears and the app never displays properly.",
We love this app but since the latest update we're not able use it. When we try to open it we're stuck looking at the yellow intro screen and it never loads. The kids are very disappointed.,
"Hello, My grandson has learned more than ever in a public school. He's homeschooling for over a year and tried every homeschool. But ABC mouse helped him know all his A B C's saying as well sight. Sight words he couldnt have learned without ABC mouse, numbers he now regonizes but didn't before. Adding and subtracting that public schools could not get him to learn. Tell time and know all colors (BASIC AND MORE.) Thank you very much!",
I wish never downloaded this. It's full of problems after problem Apps keep stopping and not functioning right. I'm trying to cancel my membership after 10 minutes from Joined but this garbage keep stopping not letting me cancel it.,
Im trying to log in after finding thr teeny tiny log in in the top right corner because i dont want charged twice for starting the stupid acct & I keep clicking on the white space to put in my email & its not working. Fix this? Or just cancel mybsubscription.,
I downloaded this game a few years ago and paid the year subscription which was $40. I had the game a few months then realized it was also charging me monthly. I deleted it. My son was 7 at the time and didn't really have interest in playing it. But I wasnt happy about the double charging,
"I Signed up and it wont even let me download the app to even cancel it, not happy not only that for your free trial just noticed they charged 79p, erm thought the first month was meant to be free! Just hurry up and fix the app so i can cancel it before more money is taken that i havent consented too!!!",
It's awesome for learning. But the constantly freezing is extremely annoying. My kids can barely get things done on it. It's a waste of money.,
wondering what's next. there are so many things to do and so much information that you child can learn from ABC to the solar system. I have a 6 and 8 year old who love it. they have only had it for 2 weeks so I will repost what is next and how they like it later. that's why it's not five stars and only 4. we just started the 4 weeks for only $19.98. WOW WOW WOW. SAVE. That's all.,
"Absolutely the best learning app ever, so thankful and so greatful for ABCmouse. Every child needs ABCmouse to prepare them for kindergarten and what a fun learning experience.",
Horrible app. It only works on desktops and laptops. It does not work on cell phones or tablets for kids on the go. Update your app ABCMouse it's 2019!,
This is sad. And disappointing. It doesn't load and app will not open on anything I've downloaded on. No matter what I've done I can't get it to load. Even on different internet connections. Will be cancelling this is a rip off for me.,
We haven't even gotten to use this yet. Will not load. We created a character and that took so much time of reloading the page. Thank you for giving us the opportunity. I don't think your system can take all the extra stuff. When it's able to support so many users we'll be more then happy to try again.,
"I ended my subscription way before the free trial date and they still charged my acount. Theres no account settings for parents to see when I started or have been charged. This company is still doing business like it's in the 90s. Grow up, every other company has.",
I am reactivated my account that I had for my 10 year old so my 5 year old could start to learn more but I'm unable to get into anything it keeps telling me my password is I correct I've reset it 6 times and still unable to gain access to add my 5 year old or update my card Information! It's really disappointing we stopped using it about 4 years ago because it froze so bad he could never play and learn but we thought with years going by it would be better we are very disappointed,
"My main ABCMouse ELA app not being able to tap / click. Here is the fix. In Android settings, go to Accessibility, then disable everything at first. By process of elimination, i have determined that the app Assistive Touch, when enabled in Android settings Accessibility, is interacting with the main ABCMouse ELA app, which should not be the case, since all other apps of ABCMouse do not exhibit this strange behavior, e.g., Math, Language, ReadingIQ, Music Videos, Science, etc., Kindly fix thanks",
My kids love ABC mouse. I would give it 5 stars but occasionally the app gets stuck and doesnt work. An email to customer service always reaolve the issue though. Would recommend. I especially love King Grammar his lessons are really funny and engaging.,
"Extremely slow. Everything loads at snail speed. AND I mean everything. A lot of the games don't properly function either. Why am I paying money for this, only for my kid to get so frustrated with nothing working that he gives up. You got money for those commercials, you got money to work on your operating system.",
First my child was put into a way advanced group that killed her motivation and made her feel stupid. Then we got locked out and paid for months of not using. The parent access is not easy. When calling to cancel they refunded one month and said it was the fact that my tablet was not updated why their site didn't work properly. Not great customer service,
"We found that half of this does not work, our kids were not happy. We cancelled the membership only to find two years later they charged our credit card for the membership that we cancelled. Even better that our mastercard put it through with a different number! Now they will not refund!",
One of the best supplemental education sources out there!,
"Couldn't even get past the first page of 2 questions to continue... I paid for a year at 50% off. My money sure came out of my account fast! I still can't get into the app. And yes, I downloaded it....",
Does not download onto Samsung Galaxy 8 +. Maybe you all should inform folks which devices are compatible with your software instead of trying to take in every dollar you can.,
"Cant set up curriculum on the app or site on Galaxy S10. Not all of us use desktops so it would be nice if that could get fixed. Buttons dont work, or files are empty.",
"BEST APP EVER! I purchased this app in 2019 (& many others before I found ABCMouse) and the progess tracker and use it for homeschooling my 4 year old. My 1, 2 and 4 year olds all love this app bundle (eight more apps included with this purchase.) With this app my 4 year old has learned how to read!! There are non learning activities on the app also like taking care of a pet unicorn and also print offs. üôåüòç",
"ABC mouse was recommended by my pediatrician for my 3year old and I regret nothing. He loves everything. Within weeks singing songs, saying first part of ABC's and recognizing numbers. Things we have been trying for months to do with him. Amazing! Worth every penny.",
"I am using g the desktop and mobile app version. Both are freezing and stalling in between moves. My kids love the content and it's fun when it's working, however, what good is the content if you're not able to use it?",
I'm giving it three stars because it was amazing until a few months ago. Kids loved it and everything was educational. Now it won't even open- it just gives us a yellow screen. That's on my phone and the Kindle.,
I downloaded this because the school said to since the corona virus shut schools down. they gave us codes to enter for a free subscription and couldnt enter that anywhere during the sign up process. then after giving all my info the stupid app wont even open!!!!!! i cant even finish setting it up for my daughter to even try it. this is the second time this app has done me in. so angry there arent even words.,
i signed up for free trial and quickly deleted it as i didnt like the interface. Still being charged without having any subscription. Such an annoying system.,
"After I signed up and paid for a subscription, I cannot get the app to work on any of my devices. I can't even seem to get to my account to cancel my subscription. Very frustrating!!!",
So somehow this stupid app has installed itself or someone has hacked my account which I've not just had to reset and it's taken money out of my bank and I didn't purchase or install this! I would like my money to be returned as I've uninstalled it as soon as I've seen the app appear on my phone! I do not want this app!,
"The app loads slowly, pages load slowly, we get errors often. We have the app on mom and dad's Samsung phones and our tablet, it works the same on all devices.",
I canceled my subscription shortly after purchasing the 1 year for my daughter. Well they charged my card anyways for a second year. Waiting to hear back from them to see if they will refund my charges. This has been happening to many of their customers.,
I just paid for a full subscription of this app to help my students and I am unable to even download the app! This is insane! If this is not rectified I will be out of so much money and stuck with a subscription that I can't even get access to to cancel.....,
This system is beyond a dream come true! This is absolutely perfect for my home school. Please make one for higher grades. My kids are in kindergarten and first grade and they love this system too. Going to be sad when 3erd grade starts and we can't use ABC mouse anymore :( we need a 3erd and 4th grade one too lol. For real tho if you home school get this with the progress tracker. You will not regret it!!!,
Mostly fantastic. The touch screen for a couple games needs to be calibrated. I also wish there was a timer so it would turn off on its own.,
I paid a whole year and for some I haven't been able to get it to work for 5 and 6 year old. That's hard earned money yall took to help my kids. That's not fair. I've restarted my phone and update your app. Nothing has helped. Please fix this or give money back.,
"BIG MISTAKE to do abc mouce. I cancel my membership due to financial difficultie and they still keep taking and stealing money off my bank account. I called the abc mouce 5 times and cancel it 5 times and they still are taking money off my bank account and the amount they take keep changing every month, it keeps getting higher. I have no ideal what else to do but to warning people about my bad experience and hopefully prevent anyone to experience myexperiencesand save anyone from getting Rob.",
"**UPDATE** working on phone now!! Not working. I can log in initially when I download it and then it goes to white screen and wont do anything else. I can access it on my laptop, but white screen on 2 phones and a tablet.... have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. This is an account for epic homeschool. Thanks.",
i change my review from 1 to 5 at first i did not figure it out how to off the talkback because it is already off but i am using accessibility menu which is also not allowed in this app so i manage to off everything by the way i am using Samsung. here my son like one of this game which is peek and pop i hope this game that every pop on a letter will have a sound of a letter so he could learn the phonics sounds. And for me as a parent this app is a good start.,
DO NOT SIGN UP TO THIS AP. I just signed up up for the free first month and tried to cancel it so I can try it before any money is taken and it's a scam. They immediately took money from my account. If I'm not refunded immediately I'll be taking this further.,
"ABC mouse is awesome !I have used the mouse as teaching tool for two generations .Two grandsons one who is 29 years old and the other one is 28 years old. Now i am using it for their children. MY 10 year old great granddaughter loved ABC mouse, she a honor roll student in the fourth grade. My 6 year old great granddaughter , new her ABC and could could to 50 when she was enrolled in a Christian day care. With the help of ABC mouse she was counting to 100. With no in school learning I purchased ABC mouse once again for. Too me it is worth the because it really helps her. Now she wants to come to my house every weekend what a great reward. Why do require 100 words I can think of about 10 one word to describe ABC mouse .Wonderful, great, fantastic, cool, neat, marvelous, tremendous, stupendous , and excellent. Thank You ABC mouse",
"temporarily worked on 3 devices, required uninstalling and reinstalling every 2-3 days because of error messages. It's a shame because I was trying to help my son and I only ended up frustrating him, and myself, even more.",
"No matter what it says, you cannot adjust the settings on this program. Whether I use the app or I use the computer, I try to limit my son from spending his tickets. All he wants to do is spend tickets and play with his hamster. No matter what, he was allowed ro spend his tickets EVEN WITH IT SHUT OFF. Not worth $10 a month",
I was very exicted about getting this app and stupidly paid the extra $30 to get 6 months. It won't even allow me to log in!!! After it they already took $40 off my credit card. I'm beyond upset. A complete ripoff!!,
Have been using it for my son since kinder years. Nice activities and loads of books on almost every topic. Content is nearly organized subject wise and also has a self-paced learning option.,
This app sucks so bad! I should not have to install the app to cancel my subscription! As everyone else mentioned it is so slow you can't even navigate it easily. It won't even load on my son's tablet at all. Do not waste your money!!,
"keep hearing great things about this app but it wont even let me sign up, I'm in Canada and it has a section when first signing up, putting in all the credit card information and it says zip or postal code but does not allow you to put letters in... which is important in a postal code. will change the review if they ever fix the app so you can actual get in and sign up",
Too many non learning distractions. Racist in that it only offers to teach one second language and they chose that language for you. Puzzles complete themselves. My child isn't showing signs of having learned anything.,
Can not even get this to download to stop my subscription before they charge me. This seems like a scam!!!! I had ABC mouse years ago and it wasn't like this. Probably going to have to change my bank info before charged!!! What a hassel!!! This is ridiculous!!!,
"My Daughter loves this app. But the money you pay for it, you shouldn't have to worry about it freezing often. It hasn't worked in a month because it keeps telling me to suspend talkback which isn't even on. More bugs need to be fixed please",
Horrible app. Freezes only works on my iPhone not available on my daughter's tablet for kids. Have nothing but trouble. It frustrates my 3 year old to no end. I would rather sit down with preschool work books and do things the old school way,
the worst app and need to contact someone about canceling the payments because i unsubscribed and still getting money taken out. seriously this is ridiculous and needs to be taken down a rip off and just love taking peoples money. if no one contacts me im going to contact my bank.,
"This app has been around for a long time and has continually has updated as time passed. Keep up the good work. ""Iron sharpens Iron for those gradually learning & teaching‚úçüòÄüó£Hoping everyone of all ages remains teachable.",
I am a paying customer and when all the kids were taken out of school and given free accounts I can't get the app to update or let me log in. My year that I paid for before all this happened is wasting away. So beyond frustrated. Would not recommend.,
Absolute nonsense to cancel the subscription. The app is way too slow. My child didn't enjoy the content. Also it kept freezing. I have unsubscribed but am billed anyway. Why!!!!!,
"Excellent interactive learning experience for young learners. All three of my daughters have used this app and are doing well academically and with age-appropriate tasks (ages 2, 7, and 11).",
it is not working. the app won't work and when I go to click classroom button the screen goes to the size of the computer and you cannot click on anything. my son uses this as part of his homework for school and we can't use it. the update made it computer format not app format,
My kids LOVE ABC Mouse and I love that they are learning so much! Great app with lots of tools for learning. The activities are stimulating and the ability to win tickets and shop for the avatar makes it exciting for the kids!,
"I purchased tge membership in my cellphone. Then I logged out because it was blocking it completely and installed in a tabled. Then tried to login from tablet and never loads completely. Then tried to login through my cellphone again and doesn't load neither. I tried to request support an the link to do that, doesn't work.",
"I just wanted to cancel my subscription that I hadn't used in 4 months. I should be able to do so from a website, it made me download the app and go through a stupid process just to cancel. Absolutely ridiculous",
"I started my free trial then I decided to cancel it two days later.Then after months,I discovered that the subscription was not canceled and the company was charging my credit card without even notifying me by email.When I told them that I canceled the free trial they said did you get a confirmation email?If not,that means your account still active.When I canceled the subscription again,I noticed that I did not receive a confirmation email until I contacted them to send me one.I don't recommend.",
"Seriously??? It's a paid app, get it together. I'm constantly deleting and reinstalling because the app just stops working. If we didn't need this during the pandemic I would be out. So disappointed and unimpressed.",
"Constantly crashes.. mobile app version, desktop version, cannot even to get it to open on the tablet... The only version that works is the website itself.",
This is a great app for the kids to play with over other things. The only issue I do not like is how much this app lags. I just updated it so I'm hoping that improves our experience. If it didn't lag I would give it five stars.,
"Really great program. Absolutely one of the best we've found. Only issue, the apps have a difficult time loading sometimes.",
"The classrooms are by far the best thing ever! I would pay more just for that feature. Great way to help your child, sometimes they need to not hear your voice only when teachingüôÇ .",
It had help me learn!,
I think I would have learned to adore this app however it's skipping terribly on my device and my four-year-old just is not interested. maybe there's some simpler apps that I would need to spend so much money on to be disappointed.,
I used this app for about an hour. It was laggy and too difficult to use for my five year old. It appears that they give you a thirty day free trial but due to some sneaky fine print they charge your card and won't refund if you are dissatisfied.,
"We love this app, it really engages our 5 year old. The only thing I wish I could request is an option for Canadian information. Or if there was a Canadian version for money, the country, our history vs USA.",
My grandchildren love this. It's very engaging and buying things witg the tickets encourages them to keep playing. It also teaches patience and saving so they can buy the things they want there are so many great things about this program try it out!!!,
We started our daughter that is 5 now on ABC Mouse when she was 2. It was the best thing we did. I am homeschooling her in PreK but she is actually doing a lot of kindergarten work and even some 1st grade. She would be very bored in public school due to how much she has learned with ABC Mouse. It i an awesome program and very affordable. Thank you ABC Mouse for how much you have helped our daughter over the years and still do!! The Thomas Family,
Great for kids to learn but the app it self is horrible. Very slow buffering even with high speed internet. Constant freezing. App definitely needs work done,
Error message app won't open at all,
"Forces you to download the app just to cancel your account. None of the website links work, chat is always ""unavailable"", and the button to submit a ticket for support is non functioning. Also way too easy for the kid and not at all worth the money",
"I cannot say enough good things about this app! My girls love it and so do I! They each have it on their tablets with a linked account on my Gmail so my second grader can visit her PreK sisters ""classroom"" and vice versa! Each of their ""learning paths"" have games, videos, and activities geared to their ages and interests! Each completed ""task"" earns them tickets they can cash in to spend on their class pets or their avatars! It's also Ad free and SOO worth the subscription!",
I signed in for the first time and finished my initial setup. After that i clicked Continue and the app doesn't open. I see a blank screen with the wait thing turning.. how do I cancel my registration.,
"I don't understand why on this app when I click on login, and prompt me for the login details, when I click on the username the keyboard never opens up. You can see like a quick blur as if it attempts to open the keyboard for input but it does not.",
"App is running so slow, how will I be able to unsubscribe before I get charged for another month. I am on the free trial but haven't been able to use it because it keeps freezing up.",
"Was working great, and still.doea for my daughter's but my son journey it won't load up the next activity so he can move forward. I emailed support bit haven't heard. Getting frustrated. Please get my son's journey going again. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling.. Thanks",
Does not work.. stuck . Is not loading the activities.. the trial session failed ! No subscription from our side! By the way tried already deinstalling and installing 3 times. It was working for one day only...,
It made me download the app in order to attempt canceling my membership. I got to the log in page. It froze. I uninstalled at reinstalled. The same thing. I can't get in to cancel my membership.,
"I decided to install this app to help my child improve her reading. The second day of using this app, my bank contacted me informing me that a transaction was denied and whether I was aware of the attempted purchase. ABC initially told me that 1 month free would be honoured BEFORE 29.99 would be deducted. What and why are they charging on the second day after installation. I don't trust these types of applications. Do not recommend!",
it graphics or whatever is to large for my phone (Samsung s9 plus) I only see half the classroom or less. and it keeps freezing and not loading the activities. The activities are only a quarter visible also..,
"My son is not able to work the app. It just says it's loading. Even tried with a wifi connection. My son gets frustrated when it won't load and have to restart. The only time it worked was when w initially installed it. We even tried on the lap top, phone and tablet. Not working.",
"App takes forever to load, freezes up and there are not clear instructions. Waste of our time & money. I cancelled it a year ago & it auto renewed again this year. I'm beyond upset & disappointed.",
Works for 2 minutes then crashes. Very frustrating. Contacted customer service and got a stock email. Wish I would not have paid for this. Sooooo disappointed.,
"Having trouble contacting support about level 3 lesson 41 not loading, even after reinstalling the app. Can't continue learning path due to glitches like these and there should be a skip function to at least continue to a different lesson.",
"Fun and educational. Easy to use, my three year old feels like a big boy doing his school work like his siblings and earning rewards along the way <3 I have each of my littles has their own account and love to hear the mouse say their name. This is a great supplement.",
"When I cancelled my account with abcmouse I put my password in to finalize the cancellation , so I thought. I was charged and then this is what was sent to me in a email from a abcmouse customer service representative ""After you signed up for a monthly subscription plan you received a separate offer to upgrade to an annual plan, during the cancellation path, which provides a significant discount over your original monthly"" THAT MAKES NO SENSE I HIT THE CANCEL LINK MY ONLY INTENTION!!!",
I cant even figure out how to create an account there's no otopions on there website or app I wasted a good 30 minutes and hey I'm no tech savvy 16yr old but I'm only 25 I know how to work a phone. How do you not have somewhere to create an account. Also incase you weren't sure you pay for it. It says free all over the app info but it's simply free to download the app. Everything inside cost moniesss,
This app has too many glitches and sometimes doesn't load at all. Only being able to use the app and not the web version Aten this happens is a bummer,
"Too much to type but I paid for a yearly subscription and I don't think we're staying... it freezes, the work for my 5 yr old, my 2 yr old do them so my 5 and 7 year old gets bored with the work that's on there for their ages....",
Not as great as they make it seem on the ads. Obviously the ads are supposed to make it seem amazing but my kids have not wanted anything to do with it. Waste of money,
"Our kids are 3 and 5 and are using the app for a few years. They can count, read, and calculate. Wonderful tool I used for homeschooling along other apps!",
"Good app but shouldnt get involved in politics, oddly enough at this time everytime you click on the people at work: police officers, nothing shows up, so courses can not be completed. This happens on all devices we have not just 1, so please fix so my son can continue learning",
Love this app the kids have so many different exercises that shows them about animals numbers letters colors there's such an abundance of knowledge it's beautiful not to mention that they also have little books that you can read along with your child or they can narrate for your child to be honest working with my granddaughter through this process I have learned things about animals I didn't know it's so cool.,
"Whoever created abc mouse is completely stupid why isnt abc mouse app working oh i figured it out. Whats wrong with you people. I create a account on abc mouse cant figure out why i cant sign in come to find out I log in with the noggin app not the one i actually created an account with, like what non sense is that and if i wasnt smart enough to figure that out u guys would keep charging me i call that problematic and a scam",
"I got ABC Mouse for my youngest of 3 boys. He has been the only one of the 3 who has not only NOT required assistance in reading and math, but excels in all subjects. I would recommend this program for every child!!",
It's been an amazing help with my son who struggles with reading.my daughter is 2 and already can count knows her ABC and can recognize her name now. I recommend it to any parent with young children. I started my daughter at 1 and she has grown so much.,
"Normally I would say. I love this app. But lately Everytime I try to log in the app glitches..rotating the screen non stop on its own with a loading symbol...after a while it freezes my tablet...please fix this..I paid for the app and I cannot access it..ive messaged customer service a few days ago .No response.my tablet is up to date,so it's not on our end.my son enjoys this app when working correctly.",
I literally just downloaded the app no more than 15 minutes ago and it doesn't work. Pretty disappointed since my 3 year old was excited to try the app since he doesn't know how to use a mouse on the computer (very limited screen time).,
"It freezes up all the time, and lags a lot. No preschooler has patience for it to unfreeze every time they want to do the next lesson. 2 days and canceled membership. Horrible app!",
Should have listened to my gut feeling when reading the other bad reviews..... I can't log in on my phone. When i try it just tries to load constantly. My other apps and net open so it's not a connection issue. I need to know how to be refunded immediately. Not happy. Paid for the year and first day i couldn't get it to load..... I expect a response as to whom to call. Thank you,
"do not get this app it is a con job . we use it for a couple of months and then we decided that the program that my child's school provides for us is better so I unsubscribed. even though I unsubscribed from this app from this app , it keeps on charging me every month.",
They hide the cancelation options and try to make it frustrating experience. Another app that loves the 'free' subscription that is pulling teeth to get out of.,
My kid enjoyed the app. Everything was working fine until today. It just froze after logged in. Both app and the website stop working.,
My 6 year old really likes this game until today. She cannot get past the yellow greeting screen. There is a arrow that points backwards and nothing happens. She is worried about her pet hamster and her cat that she needs to feed. Is this a bug that can be fixed?,
"Besides the glitching part my two year old daughter seems to get distracted a lot using this app , she throws the phone at me , messes up the room and the kitchen, she failed to graduate out of the academy, so unfortunately I uninstalled the app then reinstall when she got suspended from school ‚ù§Ô∏èso she can still learn during her punishment. She finally completed a few levels now she goes to clubs , drinks uncontrollably, bashes the kim Kardashians online and it's really starting to get to me",
Has helped my learning delayed child substantially. He really enjoys learning using ABC mouse and it is easy for him to use and navigate on his own. There are hours of safe educational content.,
I have canceled my subscription and I keep getting charged for several months now and they keep saying it's canceled but am still being charged.,
We have had ABC mouse for a few years and it has not worked properly most of the time. Have installed it on a few devices and still gets stuck or crashes.,
"We have been using the app on our tablet and have been stuck on the same type of game for awhile, I have done it to see if we move on in our learning path but we are stuck. I hope we can move on,this is a good program for kids to learn to get ready for school.",
"My 5 year old says, ""I love it and I want to keep it!"" Very well-designed app with many different learning modules and games. Great for extracurricular learning!",
"Just got this app a few days ago, so far so good, my 3 year old is enjoying it and learning responsibility as he has to care for his pets and keep them happy. The only issue I would have is the app taking a minute to load each time you click on something but it's not too big of a hassle.",
Allows me to log into my account on the website but the app keeps saying incorrect password. I reset it several times. Still not working. Takes the login screen way to long to work. Very glitchy,
i downloaded it to help my 5 yr old with sight words.. this app sucks when it was done downloading it went black and then bits of light came on my computer then when it finally was done doing that it was really blurry i couldnt see what we was doing i resized it then it went black again i put it back to were i had it then it shut off after it finally went back to the page it was blurry still im not sure if its cause i have a chromebook or what but after having it for 3 hrs i decided to delete it,
I have a five year old and a four year old and they love doing ABC mouse. We have it on our phone and the tablet and their learning so much from using ABC mouse. We love it!! It is preparing them for school!!,
"I would have given a 5 star rating except for one issue. You can't use the app on a smart tv. Yes you can use your tablet and show it on the tv, but you can't install/use it with a wireless keyboard/mouse. Besides that I have no issues with the app. Its a great learning tool.",
"Very disappointed, I payed the 6 month price and can't get it to work on my phone. I have deleted and reinstalled and it's still getting stuck on the main screen.",
"This app is very buggy. My son loves it, however it constantly freezes and lags badly. May not renew my subscription. This app needs updates & more frequent ones.",
Needs to be more customizable. Another user was added by mistake and it will not allow me to delete it. I pay for this monthly service. My son was very upset to find Halloween decorations and he could not remove them neither could I. And even past Halloween the ugly decor was still there. He was very very upset and saying mommy it won't go away. We should be able to turn it off concidering I am Paying for this service. And That Halloween stuff definetly shouldn't be there come November. Aweful.,
I don't know what happened but now I can't sign in and it won't let me change the password. The reset link keeps taking me to and update page. I'm not going to keep paying for this if it isn't going to work.,
"I like the app, but the parent settings can be confusing. They make it look like you have a fourth profile for you to use, but you don't. I would have liked to have a fourth profile for me and the baby.",
"Excellent learning tool!! With consistency, I've seen much improvement in my child and the activities are fun for him. I definitely recommend abc mouse.",
"I created an account and it won't let me log in. I'll get one step closer and it will stop on a loading screen until I restart my phone. My kids were excited for this app. I've heard good things about it, just can't use it",
I'm payed for a whole year. it runs too slow for my toddler to keep her attention. And before anyone says its probably the internet I have free apps without ads that run just fine. I just dont see paying for a whole year if it cant keep her attention.,
In what world does it make any sense to be forced to download the app to access the billing information and cancel a subscription? Intentionally designing something to be difficult to cancel is just a lack of confidence in your product.,
Had to delete because it was not loading up or doing anything. Try to reinstall it but it keeps freezing on 72% and now my daughter can't use the app even though I've paid for it.,
Hey there ms. I watched a ad that this abc mouse it was great üëç and super duper good so I downloaded it it wasn't good when I was playing there is too much lag and everything I press I need to wait for a sec but this game has full of lies and the ads may be fake I deleted it and never downloaded it again pls take the lag so then I will give a good rating,
"This app will keep taking your money years after you unsubscribe, mail or even call them to stop. My child does not need to use this app ,yet it keeps debiting my account every year. Do not give your bank details to this app.",
I used to love this app about 3 to 4 years ago when my other daughter used it. Now it is HORRIBLE!!!! I paid for a year knowing it was good and it is so slow and stops and is just not the app it was before. I will be canceling my subscription.,
Tried to change the profile to fit my 2 year old and it only updates on my chromebook. Downloaded the app to my phone & her tablet and it changes nothing to the profile or level. So annoyed.,
"As a paid app there are a lot of glitches and studders that make my 3yr old not able to play without her sisters or I to help either restart the app or complete the task, because of something missing. On one game s-z the z isn't available to click on and doesn't allow the game to progress.",
I have seen the app and was exciiting for my 4 littles to try this while in the car. After very little use and after I paid for the year I only have issues. It also isn't an app you can use without internet. #wasteofmoney,
"Amazing!!!!!!! my 3 year old loves this app. Its getting her ready for preschool. She tells me she loves this everyday. ""she's doing school already."" I definitely couldn't be happier with this app",
Can't open app at all. Downloaded 4 times.,
I signed up for the 30 day trial and didnt like it what so ever and now it wouldnt let me download the app so i can cancel my subscription been trying to download it since January...and yes i have enough storage on my phone.....it keep taking 10$ out of my account every week with out my permisson...do not i repeat DO NOT use this app...it suck and i do not recommend this app at all...,
Having difficulty clicking play on a game in the learning path. Really frustrating when my child can't continue on the learning path because it's not working.,
"This has been so worth the money! My 3&1\2 year old loves it! Not only has it been teaching him a lot about following directions, and focusing more, but we've also learned they he was already capable of so much more than we originally knew.",
The app won't allow me to login and customer service had no solution but to add 2 free months. I can't even use the app on my android device. I'll give 2 stars because it may be a good app once the technical issue is fixed....,
The app runs really slow it takes the activity forever to load. By the time it loads my 2 year old isn't interested in playing anymore. I uninstalled the app after 10 minutes of downloading it.,
"Stuck on level 7 due to extreme boredom with no way to advance past the letter songs. Dreadful. If you want kids to use it, give more than listening to 26 songs in a row.",
"Every attempt to open ABC MOUSE'S app failed. Tried ""STOP"", ""Unsubscribe"", ""Cancel "", etc., relating through ""Reply""; but, never got any response. Therefore, I have removed ABCmouse from my apps. Hopefully ABC- mouse will refund & not try to charge me any more without further action.",
"Its ok, its really slow it used to be ok untill net neutrality ended now is super slow very frustrating, my child just keeps nagging me about it, our internet is super fast but the app is still slow. I will not be buying more months after my time is up.",
"Glitchy, freezes constantly, and says ""offline"" when every other device in my house is working just fine on our wifi. My 5 year old is super disappointed. Will give more stars if uninstalled/reinstall works.",
Very engaging for both parents and kids. I really enjoy they are even able to personalize the greeting. My 3 year old daughter loves this app. Her confidence and her feeling of self accomplishment brings a smile to mine and her faces.,
"I AM SUPER PISSED! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All of their subscriptions advertise one free month. Trial period before they actually start charging you. They had like 3 or 4 different subscriptions but like I said they all offer that free month, HOWEVER THEY CHARGED ME $54.40 IMEDIATLEY AFTER PUTTING IN MY PAYMENT INFORMATION. THEN THEY ARE TELLING ME I NEED AN APPLE ID TO REQUEST A REFUND. I DON'T HAVE AN APPLE ID CAUSE I DONT USE APPLE!! UGH THEY BETTER GIVE ME THAT REFUND",
"To use the app, you must fill out personal information about both your relationship to the child, and the child's gender, none of which is any of ABC Mouse's business, nor necessary to use a learning app or any app at all. I have uninstalled the app and will not be continuing beyond their 30 day free trial.",
This app is not working correctly won't allow us to sign in no spot to sign in only picture of abc mouse no button to log in this is unreal for 12.99 looks like I'll be canceling my subscription,
"ABC mouse is the best investment we've made so far. My daughter is 3 months shy of being 3 and has been using ABC mouse for 10 months. She already knew some things before we started, but now she knows how to spell her name, our names and our dog's name. She counts to 20 and then backwards. She's learned more shapes like octagon, hexagon, she even knows what you do at stop signs and stop lights. Her ability to count backwards from 20 alone is mind blowing to my husband and I. Thank you ABC mouse!",
"Before you decide,be aware ! They will charge the 9.99 PLUS whatever ""promotion"" they're telling you they have at the moment once you pay for it ! I did the 29.99 but still was charged 9.99 it mentioned it for the yearly one NOT for the 6 month one.",
"I paid for this app and it doesn't work on my phone at all. It won't even open to a sign in page. It gets stuck on a spinning triangle, circle and square w/ yellow background. Glad I paid for a useless app.",
FIX THE TABLET VERSION OF THIS APP: 1. TURN OFF YOUR VOICE NARRATION IT SHOULD NOT BE ON BY DEFAULT!!! 2. ALLOW THE ANDROID KEYBOARD!!!! 3. OPTIMIZE THE APP FOR THE NEWER ANDROID VERSION NOTE: I WAS UNABLE TO SELECT THE PERIOD KEY AFTER BEING VERY PAITIENT WHILE USING THE APP KEYBOARD. SO I WAS UNABLE TO LOGIN. YOUR CUSTOMERS PAY GOOD MONEY FOR YOUR PROGRAM SO QC AND APP AVAILABILITY IS THE BEST WAY TO KEEP LONG TERM CUSTOMERS AND YOU'RE FAILING TO MEET STANDARDS Samsung Tablet Galaxy A7 Lite,
There really needs to be an update to the balloon pop game as it's off and doesn't pop a balloon where you press it and is super hard for my child to do. It is like the this on 3 different devices 2 galaxies and a Kindle,
"my son love abc mouse. My daughter used to use it and she loved it also. This learning service has helped my child out with so many different things, including helping him to learn how to use his chrom book. thank you abc mouse for your services for children.",
"I don't get the hype of this app. This app is more for kids who doesn't know anything, then the app would be good for them or fun. My 5 year old got bored with the app since it's not challenging for him. The kindergarten section wasn't helpful he knows that stuff but the games were just boring.",
"Was all good for a while, my 5 yr old was interested until certain applications like the learning path would freeze up, tried it on different devices and also my lab top, same exact issue. Will give 5 stars when fixed",
Wonderful! I have used this with 3 kids and they each have their favorite activities and songs but there's a plethora of others that I feel like we find something new every day...and we have been using this app for probably 5 years!!!,
**edited to include they refunded the funds as i did not ask for new subscription.** I did one time membership and it was over and now they charge me annually when I never subscribed for renewal. It's a scheme don't fall for it. The app itself my daughter used couple of time and got bored.,
"If you have Samsung tablet or cellphone don't waiste your time and money downloading this app. Since Oct 2022 I reported I can only see a yellow screen we are Feb 2023 and they still haven't fixed yet. Is not the first time, is like third time reporting the same thing and takes them too much time to fix. They want money but they don't do their job.",
I downloaded the app for my girls that are out of school due to covid-19 and the school has given parents a code to redeem... I created an account but the app never loads... I've been trying for over 3 hours... Not very satisfied... It's very frustrating not being able to let my kids continue learning through this difficult time...,
"Unfortunately, I have to update this review. Bummer, my kids like abc mouse, too. I tried adding the app to a new phone and it hasn't opened since. I actually want a refund. That's my next step. The app just blinks now. ***Fixed within 24hrs. Thank youüôÇ",
The app is not working on my mobile devices. It no longer displays my daughters avatar and the classroom comes up in portrait mode instead of landscape......please fix these issues and the app would be 5 stars,
"I bought my son a new tablet and bought his a 1 year membership for ABC mouse , but i havent been able to use it because whenever i load the app it gets stuck on the loading screen i have waiting over 30 min. for it to load and still not budging! PLEASEEEE FIX SO MY SON CAN LEARN.",
This site I don't like it I'm trying to get into my account to cancel my subscription but it keeps kicking me out when I do the question to continue how am I supposed to cancel if I can't get into my account this is making me mad üò°.,
"Downloaded the app, put in my card details for the free 30 day subscription, and as soon as my details were put in, the app never opened never got my free 30 days and I'm assuming they will try to take my money. Not happy or impressed. Do not waste your time",
Great! But today I open it and after the splash screen nothing happens. We love ABC Mouse and I hope this is a singular issue,
The app won't let you sign into your account. Total waste of time and money. Same thing happened with Adventure Academy. I prepaid for both apps for a year and got no money back when I canceled.,

"We love ABC Mouse! My 4yo has learned so many amazing things already. I was convinced when she started naming facts about fossils and dire wolves, the golden gate bridge, the galapagos islands, etc, out of the blue and with no prior exposure. I now use it to supplement homeschooling, and feel no guilt allowing ""tablet time"".",
My 5yr old loves this and its helped a lot with supporting me during her homeschooling this year. The reason im only giving 4 stars is because my daugter can fast forward through the reading books section and there shouldn't be a fast forward button as kids will just fast forward to earn points!,
I truly love this app I can practice alot with my children at home my kids really love they can do different learning activities. I love when you accomplish something activities on here you earn tokens to purchase items for thee beautiful hamster. which by the way you can name your hamster which my kids in find very awesome.And moms in dads your able to save there progress. This really is a good app for kids.,
4 stars. Because it doesn't work on computers (it makes the screen SUPER small and cut off) but works really well on my phone. My 4 year old LOVES the learning path and the fact he can own hamsters and earn tickets to upgrade his items.,
"I LOVE ABC MOUSE. My nephew Kayden has made awesome progress and he loves all the great games, the different features and I like and appreciate the feedback and progress notes to me on my phone to show his progress or to make me aware of his difficulties if any I Thank You So Much JOLANDA, Kayden and Family",
Lots of games and a lot of wasted time playing with classroom pets. There is just enough to help with remembering things they have already learned. So it's okay for a supplement for school,
"I got a discount for three months + one free month to try this garbage and I didn't signe for a monthly fees, after the first month they took money again from my bank account without my agreement. And the app is garbage it freezes all the time",
"Can't even get it to work. Has me log in, then loads me right back to the main screen. Then it just cycles from there... Would love to actually play it since my son has a sudden interest in it once again. Google Pixel 6Pro - fully updated.",
Was in the middle of paying $45 for the year and the screen went black while I was getting out my wallet... now its 59.95 what the hell? Decided to pay for it anyway and the loading screen goes to a blank yellow page. Dont waste you money.,
This app has charged my card $40 multiple times without my even after speaking with my bank and pointing out the blatant recurring charges that I was not having anything to do with spending on my card. I've actually never even been on the website or opened up the app.,
"‚Ä¢Too slow and lag (im using latest device) ‚Ä¢It's not user friendly just made it simple this is why apps slow loading most of the time game freeze ‚Ä¢Some of the activities button r too small ‚Ä¢Annoying password need to be reenter again for settings, question with answer is enough ‚Ä¢Not worth this apps will waste your money for unlimited loading & game freeze",
"I think that this app is a scam, my child wanted it because of commercials we joined, she hated it, I even tried to use it with her, anyway don't subscribe, maybe it is a thing that works for some, just not for me. But I have not been able to cancel my membership, I've tried everything, like I even got confirmation from the company that I will not be charged again. I have never received any legitimate service from this company and they cloak the scam as something good for kids. Stay away.",
"Horrible app. While the core content seems useful, the app is a disapointment. Tons of ads selling things. Buttons are done wrong so you can't see the words. Flaky. Poor rendering. Very angry the ads are so prominent even though you have to pay for a subscription. Selling children character junk without a way to turn it off is shameful.",
"since update, app has caused my tablet to restart every time I try to select anything outside of the main up. works find on my iPhone , but only this problem on android tablet. can't use it all since Dec 18 update",
This has been great since my children were 2. They loved getting on and following the path...earning tickets and buying prizes. They are 11 and 7 now and over it but for many years it was well worth the small costs! Recommend!,
"Sad. This app asked for my credit card before we even able to played a single game. In fact we were unable to play any games at all. The first page is nothing but a massive advertisement, and I was not able to get past this point. I had it for about 5 minutes before I uninstalled it. I did not see it perform, so I do not recommend.",
Absolutely love it! And so does my 5 year old. No ads or anything like that so I dont worry about her on there like I do with other learning apps. This is definitely something we will keep.fornas long as she can use it.,
"Highly disappointed! Downloaded the app and every time I try to open the app it goes blank before it can even fully load. My little one was so excited to use it and now she isn't even able to try it, she is so sad.",
I just downloaded and signed up for this this app. As soon as it got my payment information it stopped working. I can NOT sign in. I get an error message saying to retry. Each time I retry I get that same message over and over. What a disappointment. How do I cancel?,
The app constantly freezes or loads really slow on multiple devices. Then they try to make it really difficult for you to cancel your membership.,
Just got the app for my children but am having issues even opening up the app on my phone. Won't load all the way and just boots me off back to my phones home page.,
Trying to use it in my phone and it won't let me click anything so I can't get into settings or do anything in the app that's horrible I've also turned off talkback which is only the app not my phone and it still talks back to me it's a horrible app for my phone,
They better not be taking my money! I just subscribed and they say my account doesn't exist! The app takes FOREVER to get started. I am beyond furious. I will be checking my bank account everyday to see what they do and will be calling furiously!,
kept freezing on the same activity. isn't compatible with most devices. No customer support available. very disappointing.,
Downloaded the app and redownloaded and it still wont load,
Crashes immediately after logging in. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra,
"It only allows you to have a 30 day of experiencing the app, then, It says you have to pay to play the app!!! I know you need money, but Its Outrageous!!! Please Update This app!!!!!!!!!",
How is this possible? Horrendous app! Looks like it was built in 98. Functions like it's from 98. So many screens. Slow. Totally a rip off,
This app is crashing and I can't access it at all,
Can't open the app.,
Force close error,
ummm I'm a kid so I like it yayüòÅ,
JUST PAID FOR THE YEARLY AND THE APp WONT EVEN OPEN,
Garbage! Worked the first couple days and now cant get the app or website to work! I would request a refund but cant even get to the customer support page!,
"Really could have been an awesomely fun and educational app, but the experience is terribly deteriorated by the bugs throughout.",
I would rate 5 stars but I was unable to switch users on the app both on my child's tablet as well as my phone. If this problem could be fixed I'd definitely rate 5 stars till then....,
The app freezes when my child is in the middle of a lesson. This happens multiple times in one setting and we usually just cut it off so we won't have to deal with her being upset that she can't finish her activity.,
I like this a lot for my 4 yr old grandson... I do think need some instructions on how to use the app better... Other than that it's a great app... A lot to do for the child.. I think it is one of the best apps... I love how they can grow and it's not just for pre k or just preschoolers...,
I had connectivity issues the day I start to use it. ABC mouse answered quickly and now those seems to be gone. I will keep monitoring this and give more stars based on my kids feedback after a couple of weeks.,
I've been using it for years. My boys don't mind sitting with it for a while and learning while having fun! I love the many math games. I also love the traceable app that comes with it.,
My child learned a lot she 5 at 1st grade level. Only thing I don't like it's to many coloring and puzzles... app works good all my family kids use this app. The should add different languages too.,
"App doesn't work on my phone, can't log in, won't even allow me to click on log in, have tried many times uninstalling and installing. Still doesn't work",
I have canceled my account yet they have charged my account for the past 2 months. And when I asked them to check on it they say I no longer have an account with them but yet Google Play is still steadily charging my card for services that I am not getting nor that I desire. Perhaps it's not just a ABC mouse issue perhaps it's a Google Play issue but we all know how hard they are to get a hold of.,
"I love this app, so does my 2 year old daughter but the server is so SLOW and we both get frustrated with it. I love that this app is teaching my daughter when I cant but I cant stand how slow it goes.",
It said one month free trial and when I put my card in and it authorized it the next step was to pay for 1 year. It did not give me an option to use my 1 wants free trial. This thing is a scam. Don't download it. I need a block it from my pay pal,
I have not been able to download your app. I have put in my subscription details pending when your 'free month' will expire (which i never used) so i hope you wont deduct any payment since i cant use your app and there is no way to cancel my subscription,
"Freezes alot and is super slow, I'm still p the 30 day trial and I definitely dont want to continue using this app. My kids spend more time waiting and uninstalling, restarting device, receting wifi... just not worth it.",
"Im only giving 2 stars because my kids did actually pick up a couple things. Freezes, or forces closes alot. I've had to cancel my subscription 3 times now because it just magically keeps reinstating.",
"i just downloaded this app onto my chromebook today, and for the last hour i have made an account, paid for 6 months, logged in, and after i log in, once it gets to the get started page to set things up, its so small on my screen and i cant make it full screen no matter how many times i reopen the app. i cant seem to do anything on it or even use it for my daughter. im not sure if this is a bug issue or what, but please please fix it! i dont appreciate paying money for something that i cant use.",
I cancelled my subscription & I keep getting charged 1-2 random fees & on different days. I am not pleased with this app because of this frustrating situation. It's not as hype as everyone makes it out to be honestly...,
"There actually is a section under Basics that let's the parent choose which letters, numbers, etc. their child needs to focus on and provides games and activities and videos that work on one concept at a time. Exactly what is needed to line up with the focus letters they work on at school.",
ABCmouse is amazing! My 4 year old son absolutely loves it! We have it on my phone his tablet and our desk top computer. Super easy to use and works wonders!,
Very happy with this app and feel that it is worth the amount I paid for it. I love the fact that it can be set up with profiles for multiple children and individualized for each one. I would definitely recommend for anyone with small kids.,
"Takes too long to load, crashes, too cluttered for children to use. My daughter hated it. Definitely don't recommend. Get Khan Academy Kids, Starfall. They're both free to use.",
Abc mouse does not work on a s22 ultra. Right when you get to the main screen the game just crashes.,
It's a great learning app when it's working properly but now everything is freezing on it. My kids can't even do their learning path anymore.,
We don't have the best tablet but this app lags like crazy and no other apps do that on this device. Still enjoy abc mouse overall and the fact that it's available as an app.,
It's great. But it freezes on my iPad sometimes. Not sure if it's the app or because my iPad is old but that can be frustrating.,
It's a great app. If only the May '21 update wouldn't have broken the app. It only works for a minute before every activity freezes.,
I really like this learning app for my 2 year old. It's comparable to Khan Academy kids. But I don't like that on the videos it just shows a video instead of asking questions about the video.,
His favorite game will freeze up. He able to access the hard games he isnt ready for and gets very mad. It takes forever to load for him. I like it but i think they can improve it,
"I feel totally taken advantage of I am almost POSITIVE that once i realized my son had 0 interest in using the app. I ended my subscription. Over a year and a half ago. I GUESS not! I appreciate personal responsibility for not checking. But for over 18 months they have been collecting $15 off of me. After reading reviews of the customer service. I am not holding my breath for a positive resolution. My advice. Invest in 1 time purchase, education apps. Save yourself the shock.",
(tech support) The 'Log In' page from the app is broken for both my wife and my devices. The page won't load properly or activate keyboards. We're trying to log in for the 70% off coupon.,
Load times are longer then kids have patience. Crashes constantly. Just a pain to use. Being on a call and trying to fix this is infuriating.,
When It Works Its Great...But It Doesn't Always Work. The app lags a lot and often times out. It isn't consistent and that makes me not want to recommend ABCMouse.,
My son learns from the app when it runs well but it constantly crashes. I wouldn't be as upset if I wasn't paying for the service. You would think as a paid app it would run as its suppose to.,
"This is a great way to help build you child's mind. lots of fun brain games, reading and cool coloring pages for the kids. My nieces are hooked on it, I don't regret signing up.",
uninstalled. one month free trial which is fine but wanted credit card details to be able to play and would automatically charge after the month free trial.,
"I love the concepts, but hardly ever use app and my paid membership due to how hard it is to get the app to open! Both on my phone and on our tablet. I wish it was more user friendly for my 5 year old. I just got a membership increase today, and I believe I'm going to cancel.",
"App never works, crashes all the time. Cant even cancel sub because the app crashes. A good idea and when it did work the kids loved it.",
Best app ever. My daughter love it so much. She learned a lot from this and she just turned 4y.o . I even add my goddaughter which is same age as my daughter and she start learning a lot.,
"Support page is a joke, contact us button redirects to FAQ and the FAQ page is just completely blank. Its almost like they're trying to make it as difficult as possible for people to cancel their subscriptions.",
"Cannot login, I paid about $100 and it doesn't work. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app it doesn't work. I also tried to just use a browser but it direct me to download the app and use it instead. So far I'm not impressed.",
Slow load times and sound wouldn't work last time I installed it. Kids wanted to play but couldn't hear instructions paid for a uears subscription but can't even use the app. Please send refund.,
Very helpful for your preschoolers!,
"This App keeps freezing up!!! I have a BRAND NEW CHROMEBOOK, and your app isn't working!! To delete it would require my son to start all over again, and THAT is UNACCEPTABLE!!!",
"Doesn't work, always freezing, always buffering. Idea was nice but if it never works what is the point. Prepaid for a year and have to request a refund.",
"Not what I expected, always crashing and it was super frustrating. My kids like Reading Eggs better so we're going back to Reading eggs",
It's a good concept but some of the games move so slow that they're not even worth playing. Ex: the anteater game and the one where a girl is spinning a wheel.,
"It refuses to open on my phone. The screen rotates by itself and then unrotates until it's frozen horizontally with half the screen missing on my vertical phone. On top of this, the buttons are sideways as if the phone were still horizontal",
I deleted this app last year and I am still being charged...The app was very useful but presently I can no longer allow to keep it or pay for it during this economic downturn....every penny and dollar is important and right now this is a want nor a need....please stop charging me for a deleted app plz...I can't afford it anymore,
"It's been two years that we have used ABCMouse. It has kept my grandson engaged and grown with himas he has grown, matured and developed new skills and abilities. It has been more than worth the investment.",
"The programs are great! My children both love it. The app however, is the worst! Tons of glitches and loading problems.",
The app was working on all my devices and now it is not. I will be cancelling my subscription and telling others about how bad this is.,
"Terrible app. First they double charged me, and on top of that the app is constantly freezing up. Not worth a penny. Can't even get in touch with anyone to get a refund.",
I can't even get the marketing video to play on my Galaxy 10. I tried contacting customer service but they won't respond with anything except for an automated response saying I need to log in. I can't log in because I can't even watch the video to subscribe and why would I want to if it doesn't work,
"For some reason TalkBack is enabled when I open the app, and none of the text boxes allow me to enter text, so I can't log in! Very frustrating!",
"GREAT educational tool for my 4 yr old. Doesn't work well on Android phone or tablet, so disappointing. we use in in the computer but I would LOVE to use ir on the go. hope they improve this.",
This app hangs up all the time and is pretty terrible on a smartphone. Not optimized for mobile. I paid for a year's worth of the service and my son can barely use it.,
"App stopped working suddenly and couldn't be reinstalled. If you have a tablet from 2016, the latest OS no longer works with the app. Customer support told me to buy a new tablet of teach my 4 year old how to use a computer. Needless to say my son is upset and I'm quite angry seeing as I pay for the app and evaluation center.",
"My daughter loves this, been olaying wince she was 2 and knoes her whole alphabet and can count up to 20!! Knows all her shapes, colors and can add and subtract! At 4!",
"Wheel of ABCmouse my son has learned so much and it is keeping him busy during this tough time !!! It""s a fight to get my son and niece off the computer and tablet when they are on the app!! It is so worth it and I will continue to use abc mouse",
"Am sorry I payed for a year of this app it's a waste of money it does not work it's always freezing an the home page now wouldn't load, I have to keep on uninstalling it and installing it back it's ridiculous! Please fix this",
My daughter loves it but it takes forever to load. And ince loaded it constantly lags. Very frustrating. Had to cancel my subscription. Very dissatisfied.,
"This service is garbage! I ran into an error while trying to set up the app and it wouldn't let me continue, and now I cant log in at all. I want to cancel this service but now I cant even access it!!! I'd give no stars if i could.",
"I can't get this app to work! It freezes up at the log in page, won't bring up my keyboard! Very frustrating! Fix and I'll try to gice a better rating!",
"this is awesome, our granddaughter excelled using this app. unfortunately our wifi was not quick enough for her to keep her interest to continue. however, we hope to better signal at a later time and will reconnect with ABCmouse",
Recurring charges with no notifications. Just found out I had been charged $50 for months of subscription from a trial in the spring and didn't receive one email receipt letting me know.,
"Profile creation locked up. Needed to be relaunched. Then the app locked up after a couple minutes of use. App will not load now. Payment authorization worked fine, surprisingly.",
Just subscribed and downloaded the app but it won't work at all! It opens to the Get Started screen but will not do anything at all! My four year old is extremely disappointed!,
"Love this app. Its engaging, informative and extremely helpful to families on the go. This app gives me time to cook and do chores while the children learn as i know they are engaged in age appropriate content. Its great for homeschooling and supplementing. Love it",
"Not sure if I want to continue with my subscription. We are still within our first month free and the site is incredibly slow. It makes my kids frustrated and lose interest in the program. It's unfortunate, it seems like it could be a great opportunity for my 3 and 4 year.",
"the app itself is maddening. it regularly freezes, makes my daughter restart from the beginning after already completing the path. I pay monthly for this and am highly disappointed in the quality of this app.",
"This app has so much information and kid friendly educational options but the constant need to restart, refresh and redo activities prevents progression and makes it uninteresting and frustrating for toddlers.",
I'ma change my review to a 3 to a 1. The money is still expensive bc it's a SCAM! Glitches too. One time we a was gone to a restaurant but it glitches. PLZ fix the issue. If it wasn't a scam I would sign in. So frustrating. Ty!,
great app but has one glitch that I've noticed...in the learning path when you get past the first gift you cant do anymore activities in that part of the app...tried closing it out and restarting but no luck...such a shame cuz my 3 year old loves the app,
"It is slow to load and freezes .....some features dont even work ! Kind of frustrating for a kid and she then loses interest . If this is how it is , I will be cancelling !",
Its a great app for kids age 2-8. My son is 3 and loves the app. His favorite is tracing. I love how the app has different apps to download the helps a child have a learning experience.,
After trying to download then trying to open the app it just never works. It's been error message after error. I'm requesting a refund. Too bad. I was hoping my child could use it.,
It's great but today I have been having the worst trouble with ABC Mouse with phone app and in the laptop . I hope whatever is wrong gets resolved QUICKLY! Would have given 5 starts until this stuff happening today. We have enough on our hands I dont want angry toddlers right now. I hope you can help. (We still love you) Edit: problem was fixed my children are happy they get to use their ABC Mouse again.,
"Sometimes it takes a little long to load, but its a really great app for my kiddo. He is 3 and already knows A-Z, counts from 0-40, knows his colors, simple addition and subtraction. ABCmouse is great!",
"The curriculum would be great but nothing works! We are stuck on the learning path because a video won't load, its so frustrating.",
I am trying to cancel my services but forgot my password and keep asking to send a reset to my email but never sends. It loads to slow and my son loses interest very fast because of it. He's diagnosed with ADHD for thinking online learning might help but why is it so difficult to cancel?,
"galaxy s9+ app freezing and not loading. Have tried it on a tablet and another phone, same results. for a monthly fee, app shouldn't have any issues.",
"This game started out great. My daughter really liked it, but then she started stuttering what sounded like racist remarks. I was concerned and watched her play this game and noticed alot of the voice acting terms sounded like ethnic slurs. I do not think it was intentional but the person with a mandrin accent saying sinks and naggers just seems problematic, especially when you consider how the chinese government is treating the weegers ( i know i did not spell that right)",
"Cost $ and is still Full of bugs... also, it is increasingly full of passive engagement like videos vs activities. If he wants he can just sit and watch tv in this app. Very disappointing",
I avoided ABCmouse at the start of Covid because I didn't want to pay for it. Now I feel silly. It's a wonderful application and it has a huge amount of quality content. I'll be a paying customer for at least 2 more years.,
App worked for 4 days and suddenly stopped opening. Uninstall and reinstall over and over and same issue! Guess what? I paid for the year subscription upon signing up!l,
A very unreliable app. Constantly fails to function on both Android OS and crApple iOS. Child is unable to advance in level's lesson due to blank screen.,
"Works great on the ipad. Trying to install on a LG phone, but it keeps giving an error message. Plenty of space, but won't install.",
"Horrible! I signed up for this as an incentive for a gift card planning to go cancel it immediately, but it was a nightmare!!!! I will never fall for this BS again!",
My kids & myself love the app. The loving learning while the play but unfortunately it won't let log-in. I bought a year bundle back in March and now it's trying to charge me again before the year is already up. We use it to help make homeschool fun,
"Hangs, does not register clicks, has severe problems with rendering. IMO, given the content, the app is overpriced. I can not recommend.",
"So i bought this for a year, was able to do a lesson then nothing. Things keep freezing and upsetting my child and me. Maybe YOU need a better operating system. I bought a brand new hp chromebook just for my child. Get with it people.",
"Wont load, no matter what device we are on it just aays error. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled and tried it from the desk top. Very disappointed to pay for something we cant use.",
"I subscribed initially but cancelled because ny son refused to use it. So am surprised that am being charged for what i have not used. I immediately downloaded the app to see if i could unsubscribe from that platform and yet my username is not working, so why am i being charged when its clear i have been unsubscribed. I intend to report this to goggle officialy if my refunds are not sent. Please i need my refund immediately.",
"Great! I love abc mouse and my kids love it even more, you may see comments on here about it not working right or it only working raerly but idk what they are talking about, i only have problems raerly. We are in a pandemic people so of course abc might mess up a little do you know how meny kids are useing it right now? Lots, bottom line, thank you abc mouse for putting this app out and making it just a little easer to teach my kids. üëç",
It's a great app ... when it's working! on a daily basis it freezes or takes forever to go from one thing to the next. And we all know how patient toddlers are!,
"I got an Amazon fire HD kids edition because of the parental controls, only to find out that not only is the app incompatable, but for some reason so is the web site. We paid for the program and now my 3 yr old can't use it.",
can't even finish the signing up process. I have uninstalled so many times just trying to finish the signing up process and can not the discount code they offered on the radio will cost you more than double their normal membership I'm so dissapointed,
I can't get past the blue screen. Just wants me to upgrade but I've never actually seen anything on the app. Absolute garbage. Membership cancelled,
"My kids love this app , it has helped them so much with learning the sound of letters & blending of them also the entertaining songs help them remember the primary colors & so much more !!!",
We have a problem. I thought that putting the email the last time was supposed to be to get info on the app. I was charged for this app when I don't even have an account or ever even used the app in the first place. I do not want to keep this app & I'd like a refund immediately.,
"It's a good app and my son loves playing on it but it is incredibly slow and lags a lot. I see that it was just updated, but my son was still getting impatient waiting for screens to load and for his touch to initiate the actions.",
We love it! It teaches our little one so many things that will give her a jumpstart on school. She loves earning points so she can purchase animals and learn responsibilities.,
"Great learning app! Only reason I didn't give five stars is that it's slow to load. I would prefer that math was integrated rather than a separate app (no extra cost for math, though).",
After you pay it doesnt give you the option to play without using the app but then the app doesn't even work. It just freezes non stop.,
I'm having issues with the app opening. I try unintelligible and reinstalling but have the same issue. Takes to long to open after you input your login info. Try multiple platforms. All the same,
"No sound on samsung s10 with the app. If I try the website, it want to force me to download the app, which is useless. On google chromebook, app is very glitchy; stalls constantly.",
This app is amazing. My son is 4 and loves the activies and all the song. He opens the app all the time to listen to the alphabet songs and practice tracing the letters.,
My 3 year old daughter loves this app and it's helping her get ahead while at home learning. I highly recommend this app for all young children learning and growing.,
"The app freezes. The learning path froze while loading in an activity as well as none of the reading games will load, tried all 3 available books on the shelf and sat in a load screen for 20mins. Nope don't even waste your money if you're mobile.",
I've been trying to download to phones very slow and won't finish profile. Keeps saying error. Tried to download yo laptop no luck. Very frustrating and disappointing!,
It would be good if the app would quit crashing and freezing. We have tried on several devices and it is the same on all of them.,
i love abc mouse it does wonders but the app is no longer working on my tablet or phone. it just freezes up. It's very frustrating because being at home at the desk too is not always convenient.,
I signed up and put in my card information and tried to log in and it just goes blank or shows its loading. Ive tried everything from turning off and on the phone and uninstalling and installing the app... NOTHING WORKS!!,
"Too slow to load up, not intuitive. Hardly used a few exercises which were not more than anything one cannot get in free domain.",
Awesome Learning System! My 3 Boys Love It! They are catching on so wonderfully to the subjects! I use ABCMouse as an additional lesson for the school year and they love it! They get excited when it's ABCMouse time!,
We just recently got the subscription and my son loves it! I'm so glad that he's able to learn in a fun way and that he actually likes doing it! He's three and a half and can work the entire app himself,
It's a great learning tool for my 3 and 4 year old. But it constantly freezes. I've tried it on several devices and the result is the same. It's so disappointing because we really do like this app.,
Using the app on a laptop can be a little hard to use at times but over all great hopefully the app can have a subject to subject course for kids working from home but till then the app is great,
"I've got this app on my sons tablet. I really rate the app and my son is learning from it, however the slow load times are really annoying and it's really putting me off continuing with the subscription. If it doesn't get sorted soon, I will be cancelling.",
Would be a great learning tool if the app wasnt loaded with bugs. It freezes constantly which makes use of the app virtually useless. Very disappointing. F-,
"Got my daughter started doing this back in 2009 before it became this popular. I been using it ever since with other kids,niece,nephew love it... Abc mouse really helped my daughter she been written short books since she was 5 and draw very well...I can honestly say ABC Mouse definitely played a big part",
"It's a good way for children to learn. My biggest issue is the lack of representation of all of the brown children of the world in the stories. The only time I have seen people that represent me and my family, they are singing and dancing as if we don't have favorite colors or favorite things or are capable of being in just a normal story about colors or numbers. That is main reason for my dissatisfaction in the app. Why does this even need to be stated in my 2018?",
"This last update is bug filled. Activities keep locking up, forcing me to exit the app. It takes forever to reopen/reload the app, once it does i am forced to log back in.",
I cancelled my account in 2018!! All because I was never able to log into my account. Its now 2021 and I'm still being charged on a card that has been expired for sometime now... customer service says they cancelled my account but couldn't give me money back because of the 90 days...,
"Love it. The songs, exercises etc. Worth every penny. It's funny how people expect this awesome app to be free. That would be very unfair to all the intelligent minds who put this together . 5 stars!!!",
Best app ever. But there's one problem. We're in Jamaica and I wanted my little sister to try this app but it requires money that I don't have. So I was wondering if we could do the free one month trial then in the future we can pay monthly.,
"ABC Mouse is wonderful as a supplement or as a full home educating curriculum. It's fun, gentle program that offers multiple ways to learn concepts that align with school standards.",
"Top educational App, I only have found 3 apps that I consistently use for my toddler and this is one of them. They are exposed to so many things through this app, they cover every subject and needed skills.",
"Exceptional! I have had membership since 2012. I taught my son to read before he was 2 years old. ABC mouse. com has been a definite resourceful, teaching tool for our family!",
"Won't download on the family tablet, only on my phone, so my daughter is forever using my phone which I need to use for work most days, it gets right to 99% of download then says it can't install it,... WHY? Works well on my phone but I would like it even better if I could install it on another device",
"Surprise surprise! Thanks to this app my kid is learning a lot. Nowadays kids only play with devices making it hard to teach them anything, so as long as he learns something while playing that's a plus.",
does not work on my phone. have uninstalled and installed again about 5 times. I have a galaxy s9 and it just freezes the second you open it. dont waste your time. calling to cancel now.,
after my son uses the learning path for 3 sessions the app freezes. i then have to uninstall it and reinstall then log back in to go to the next session. my son loves the app but this condition has flawed it,
"My daughter has been on the program since her kindergarten teacher set her class up with her own account. It has made such a BIG difference for her! She loves to learn and has excelled in everything she tries. Between ABCMOUSE and the local Library, my kid is a 98-100% student! Thanks ABCMOUSE!",
"Great app & the kids LOVE LOVE it, It's a WIN WIN. Sometimes it may look like they're not learning, but there is a learning experience in every activity.",
Terrible . I signed up for a free trial and they charge my card the full year. Now no one has responded to my email. I want a refund and this subscription cancelled! Never again! UPDATE: ABC refunded me. I will still never use them again.,
"The app has stopped working completely. I have restarted the app, my phone, and reinstalled. The app still will not open.",
With the pandemic and my older children going virtual I was worried about my preschoolers missing out on that Pre-K boost. What's even better is that they can both do it at their own level. And they LOVE it! It's the first thing they ask to do when they wake up each day and I have to set timers or they'll never stop! üòÅ,
"So far the 3 kids are enjoying themselves with this app. My 2 year old is learning more and more each day, and my reader is reading so much better. As far as my 3 year old she already knew many things so this is just re enforcement for her.",
"My two grandchildren love this. They are having fun and learning so much. They have used everyday since I got it for them. Thank you ...Very very disappointed the included free apps won't download on Kindles, but that's not abcmouse's fault.",
"my son loves this app, there is so much for him to do and its really helping him recognize shapes, colors etc. He is 2 years old and can recognize animals and objects, will definitely keep this for a long time.",
Started put w/a trial offer & having trouble unsubscribing!!! Now paying for something I don't want or use. Am furious app or instructions don't help me a bit. Desperately want OUT!!! Not happy w/ABC Mouse at all. Very unsatisfied customer. HELP!!!,
App is SLOW and always freezing. The fact tgat 1 uear kater the same things is an issue is a problem. All the money received fir this service and tou have such a scrappy app. I recently renewed sue ti great content but none if devices works consistently with this app,
The app keeps freezing on the learning path. Please fix. I paid for the full version which is very disappointing.,
Yall know you wrong. You cant even login. Theres a voice in the background talking really fast like its fastforwarding and then its stuck you cant click on anything on the login page. Havent used it for 2 months. Might as well get my damn money back.,
"I keep trying to get this app for my 4 year old and it will not even allow us to download the app at all, and we have tried on 3 different devices. I thought it would be something fun and educational for my son, but if I cant get it to download I will be canceling our subscription.",
Freezes and doesn't always load. Occassionally loses progress. Otherwise it is a good program if it would run right.,
My kids liked the app but then didnt want to use it anymore so i cancelled the subscription. I keep getting charged for subscription even after cancelling. I have contacted them on 3 different occasions. They said they cannot find my user info and that is it...how cant you not find my info but charge my account?,
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because some things my kiddo has to hold the mouse down and move her other finger at the same time and thats very difficult for her. looking at getting her a wireless mouse to make it easier,
My son is 6 and he is A.D.H.D so he does have alot of trouble sitting and focusing long enough to remember learning new things like letter blends all blend in with his sight words and spelling words but he is really into games no mater if its card games video games one on one game made up games it doesnt matter but i tried everything you could think of and he was still falling behind :( but im a mother not a teacher because of ABC MOUSE he is advanced all others so Thank you ABC MOUSE‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüèÜüèÖ,
"My 2 year old son loves it. He plays it all the time and in two weeks I have already seen him grow. The only down side is it crashes or freezes constantly. We have a fairly new tablet for it, so I'm not sure why it does it.",
My son loves ABC Mouse and has learned so much. He has a lot fun playing the games and I like that he is learning new things. He loves the farm the most and popping balloons.,
"My son can't complete the lessons bc they don't show up on the screen, it just plays the audio. So how can he finish if it doesn't work properly¬ø",
I cancelled a subscription in October 2020 and looking at my bank statement I am still being charged they've gone so far as to charge me twice in one day and again a week later and that was June 2021 eight months after I cancelled my subscription I read somewhere they don't give refunds I'm pulling my statements from October to present they're giving me my money back and that's a bet...I'm sorry people( Alex Kovacs ) we shouldnt have to uninstall and then reinstall the app it wasted time,
"amazing... my son is smart anyway so im not surprised but its so fun for him and it keeps interested... so we will be going through the to the 2nd grade... also, planning on his little bro doing abc.mouse when hes old enough... this mommy of 2 beautiful boys, thanks abc.mouse, thanks so much!",
"Would be great if it actually loaded the games. I tried to put it on my laptop, it would just say loading for awhile. Decide to put it on my phone instead, hoping we would have better luck...and pretty much the same issue.",
"This app is incredibly slow and freezes on a regular basis, will NOT be resubscribing. My first bad review of an app is here. When it does work it's mediocre and outdated",
"ABC mouse is cool and engaging my kids have been using it for years. Just wish they had things to do for older kids. Both my 7 year old and 9 year old find it boring, they fly through it",
Easy for my kid to use. Even has a little pets to teach responsibility. And the learning path keeps her occupied everyday. Has something for everyone and yet it's never the same thing twice. Even if she does the same type of lesson.,
paid for a year in full and havnt been able to access my account since the purchase. I've been noncontact with the company as well as they can bot locate my purchase so pretty much I'm sol. horrible customer service.,
"I can't even start it up. Every time reinstall this app and open it, it says offline. This is extremely disappointing and I already paid for it. If I could rate zero, I would.",
I don't even have talk back on my phone but some how it's stuck on this app and it's not letting me click the get started button so I can't even cancel my subscription absolutely the worst most scamming app ive ever seen.,
Ok I just purchased this app because it has such great reviews and I needed help with my daughter but it's been two hours since and I have been non stop trying to install it and it just won't appear at all. This tells me a lot of what the actual program might be like,
The app would not work on my samsung s8. It didn't register the touches and had horrible drag time. I paid for the year trying to save 50%...I am hoping for a refund or paypal protection here I come.,
I've spent 45 minutes trying to log on in the app and online. They are quick to take your credit card information but is slow for anything else. I can't even log on to cancel this. I refuse to pay for something I can't use.,
I just downloaded this app and am finding it to be extremely slow. I have it on 3 devices and it's extremely slow on all three. I haven't been able to do anything except wait. ü§®,
"Keeps my 3 yr old niece entertained. I sometimes question if some of the activities are above her level, but she's learning how to navigate and loves it.",
Does nothing but crash on my Android. Waste of money when it does not work. Managed to get it to work only after uninstalling and reinstalling. The last update made the app not work.,
My daughter absolutely loves it and so do i! So much for her to go through i love the learning path and printables they provide i was able to laminate allot of the worksheets for reuse id recomend to any parent!,
"This is an amazing app, very educational with lots of options, it grows with the child. I have a 2 year old and a 7 year old that enjoy playing and learning with this app.",
I use to do this on the computer in elementary school... now they have it as an app in the Google play store... if you want to educate your kids in a fun way and teach them some basic studies... this is the program for them! I love you!,
Can't even get the app to load right. Basically signed up and then the rest of the app wont open full window. Tried updating. Can not get it to work.,
Just downloaded this app for my daughter. It only worked literally just one time. I have paid for 6 month subscription and cannot use this app. Would like to have full refund or fix this up ASAP.,
"my 4 year deleted it off my phone, now it says it cant be installed back. im paying 9.99 a month for an app i cant use. how do i cancel my membership? he really liked it until he got frustrated with all the connection issues and some of the program messing up.",
"My only problem so far, is that I see no option for children to sell an item back for a small amount of tickets. My son is learning to play the games and buy small items. But he tends to over buy or hit the button. How do we get rid of these items? I would like to get some of his tickets back.",
"Downloaded the app today and already experienced delays and glitches. I will continue to monitor the functionality of this app, but probably won't keep past my 2months. This is my 2nd attempt trying to utilize ABC mouse. My first was with my first child, who is now 13.",
"my kids never used it and I had to download the app to my phone just to cancel. They should let you have access to everything through their website directly, not just through the app.",
"Wish I read the Reviews first, I had heard great things about this app and wanted my 5yo daughter to have educational activities while out of school. I cant even get a full screen to come up, tried to uninstall and start over but same issue. What a huge disappointment.",
"Well rounded and fun, good repetition. My boys have been using it for a few years now and I can see major improvement in their reading and math",
"My 4yo loves this app. She's learning so fast and it's help full when I just need her to be still. Sadly though, the app runs to slow for her to clean her fish tank or feed elephants. I checked, my device meets the system requirments.",
"My kids love this app and so do I. They learn so much, even from ABC Mouse TV (my son will randomly ask about places in China or tell me things he learned about pandas etc.) We generally limit screen time but this is one I'm often tempted to give them.",
"This is a great app that has helped my grandson in many ways. There are hardly words to express our gradatute to how it's improved his learning skls, W/HomeSchooling. Many challenges of abuse: Mentally,Physically, Emotionally from a NO GOOD PARIENT FACING CHARGES. Now we grandparents have Total Guardianship of him 7 and his brother 13, AN 3 more boys coming all same situastion. These 2 after years of Patients, Counceling, Total Love from our Whole Hearts, But God Really Did it by Guiding US!",
"Lots and lots of fun, educational games. My almost-5-year-old loves earning tickets to buy his virtual aquarium items. He also loves the puzzles and ""Hamster Bowling."" We plan to use it for a long time.",
"I tried to cancel my membership during trial. thought it went thru. Never signed in the screen moved way to slow. If somebody will please le me know how i can do this without downloading the app again, i would appreciate it",
Just got this for my 3 yo and it's absolutely awesome. My little one is learning so much already and abc mouse is extremely beneficial. Highly recommend this for anyone that has preschool age kids.,
"App freezes up frequently, frustrating 4 yr old, he wants his pets to be able to play together where they are not lonely. Many good features",
"i downloaded the app to my chromebook for my 3 yr old twins, however when i log in i cant get beyond that point. A screen that says ""get started"" comes on, but i can even click the option, nor can i even see the entire screen.",
Great material but slow and gets stuck. My son has been stuck on his learning path for weeks. We've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it doesn't help. Cancelled subscription!,
"I wrote a fair review about this program giving it 4 stars,somehow it was deleted. I use it on a PC, tablet,& the app. I complained about super LONG load time. It takes away from the experience! This program isn't worth the cost they ask for@ $80 a year w/these issues. It glitches, freezes, & has to be reloaded many times even on my PC. Please fix this! You are only allowed 3 child profiles for families, homeschooling, or Sunday school teachers who offer education programs in low income areas.",
"The app itself is great but it freezes EVERY time , multiple times. It makes it unusable! Takes away the fun from it",
"Could you put unlimited games,art,and amount of fish to fit in the tank?I love this game anyway.Could you also add Set the Clock to the School Kids Section too,in Grades-1-&-2?Thank you.AND add another length to the learning path and help us color in the lines for dot-to-dots and free draw,plus dots for coloring.Thank you again. Could you make Dragon üêâ pets, Unicorn ü¶Ñ pets, and our rooms cost a lot less and help üÜò us get way more tickets in activities, plus an extra learning path? Yay!",
"Too many distractions. My son ignores the games. Instead, he constantly edits his avatar, plays with the virtual pet, and watches the same video over and over. And when he does open a game, it allows him to exit without completing it. Not very educational at all. How can I get a refund?",
"I heard great things about this product, but sadly it has not live up to the hype. The app in general has alot of glitches. Some activities won't load. It doesn't matter if I try using it on my laptop or phone or the internet connection. It just doesn't work.",
very disapointed. i used to have this app for my daughter she loved it. i finally get around to re newing it and everytime i log in the screen gets small and i cant do anything. has this issue been mixed or did i just waste my money smh,
Have been stuck on the same activity for a WEEK now ! My daughter can't continue with her schooling because the app won't load ... If its gonna be like this I will have no choice but to unsubscribe. There is no point in paying for something you can't use,
Trying it for the trial and so far my 3yo likes it quite a bit. The learning path sections are short enough that it limits screen time but he still learns a good amount.,
"fantastic when there's Wi-Fi, I love this software. I give it 4 stars only because it's pretty limited to online only. Needs more offline content.",
"ABC mouse is a lifesaver. When we suddenly had school close for the rest of the school year and mom/dad were working from home, the prospect of homeschooling our kindergartener was daunting! Thank goodness ABC mouse was offering a great deal for a year's subscription. our kindergartener LOVES ABC mouse and thinks they're getting a treat every time we allow them to play. In reality, we are al getting our work done at home and enjoying it at the same time.",
great program my son is 4 almost 5 and homeschooled thos helps keep him on his toes. very Advamced. He actually understands. My husband and I definetly admitt to needing a source of help and we are amazed. Great Program,
Install-took forever. Drained my battery even when plugged in. Once I deleted it my phone ran great again. It basically crashed my phone. Will not recommend to anyone and will not download again.,
Our 5 year old is so smart and even more sharp now thanks to ABC mouse!!!! She looks forward to checking on her pets each day and that encourages her to get on here!! Thank you ABC mouse y'all are awesomeü§©ü§©ü§©,
"Horrible!!! They took all of the money out of my bank and then every attempt i have made to contact them to cancel with them or get some of my money back, they say their website is temporarily down. Strongly dont recommend at all",
I don't know what is up with this company. Agaibst my better judgement I was giving them a second chance. Tried to load the app and they would't allow me to put the correct age levrl. Now they won't let me go back to correct their error.,
I will happily revise my review when the app starts working again. We have a paid subscription that my child cannot use because the app will not load on her tablet as of this week. Uninstalled and reinstalled already. Extremely disappointed and my child is heartbroken because she cannot access her games and hampsters.,
Rip off. Will take your money and not give you service. You can cancel the service but they still charge you. I've gotten three charges since canceling it. It's worthless.,
the app crashes alot .... it runs slow and when it does work it takes forever to load things hate paying so much for my kids to keep being booted and having to download multiple apps for what should be on one,
i originally was offered a year's subscription and paid it in december. Then come january i have been charged 10$ monthly. This is a RIPOFF. .Very slow or NOT at all . Not the amount offered.,
Great! Fantastic! wonderful! amazing! to see your child learning and growing with ABCmouse my daughter has been using ABCmouse since she was two She really enjoys it I can tell she's learning Plus ABC Mouse will help when she gets older and starts in preschool thank you ABC Mouse. It truly is a fantastic wonderful amazing app!!,
To difficult for children to learn anything... so much easier printing stuff and having them do it old school.,
App is not working. It won't even let me type in anything it just speaks won't let me exit and it's crashed completely. I am extremely irritated.,
Thank you for charging a ridiculous amount for my child to have fun games he learns from & for making children happy or incredibly devastated that their parents can or cannot afford it. We can not afford it so thanks for making me into the loser parent that can't provide it for my child & there possible better education! You big companies play on parents guilt & it's disgusting because you don't have to tell & see the kids face when they didn't get it after being good year round.üëéüíªüí∏,
Edit: Called customer service and they were able to fix everything so that it's working now. Very happy with the app now. I really liked using the website years ago with my then youngest and I'm liking the app just as much.,
I've had this a few years on auto pay. Has never held my toddler's attention. I finally remembered to cancel it before the renewal. There's to long of down time between events,
Seriously horrible. Don't waste your time! I can't even log in to cancel my subscription. It won't let me past the log in page before the app freezes up. I wish I would have read the reviews before downloading.,
I would like to cancel immediately the app will not load & does not work! I can't even go to the parents page from your website because it prompts me to download your app that doesn't work. Please do not charge my card thank you,
Hardly loads and took forever to set up on my phone. Finally went on my laptop to get it set up. My son started the preschool one and did the first activity 3 times between the laptop and phone and the next activity never did work. Definitely not worth the money.,
"Terrible app for tablets or phones. It even messes up on the computer I was so disappointed, cant even get the app to work so I can cancel my subscription.",
I cancelled this app like 3 months ago and they keep withdrawing from the monthly payment from my account I tried to contact them again but since this pandemia is happening they are not answering the phones I'm trying to email them again This is frustrating üò†,
"Doesn't fill the screen, zoom in, or rotate. Can't read the tiny words or select the right thing. Would be good if worked properly",
Really great app for early learners. I use this to supplement my child's learning and it is just a great app with lots of resources. It goes up to 2nd grade.,
"I love this app, my children love it. easy to use. very educational. payment isn't too bad... wish there was a way to do split payments to continue to use it. I think it deserves a 5 star rating. üòä",
"My son is stuck at the learning path, space maze. He can not get through so we just have to stop the subscription. Apps keeps crashing and lagging too.",
"I've been trying to unsubscribe for months, I can't even log in to do so....the damn talk back is annoying. And once I get to the log in page it will not allow me to press anything.....I want it off my phone and I want it to stop taking money!!!!!!!",
My daughter loves this app! I do too! When my daughter first started this app her talking was not clear and only a few weeks she is speaking more clearly and I can't get over how interactive she gets using ABC mouse.,
I would like for this to stop taking money out my account cause it doesn't work on my tablet or phone it only takes up space and I'm very pissed cause I can't talk to customer support üò† about it. I would like my money to put back into my account and unsubscribe me from this immediately don't want to bother with it anymore thanks in advance,
Abcmouse has been so good so far. My kid loves it and has learned so much so far. Shes learning so much and she is entertained the whole time! It even is fun for me when we play along together!!!,
I gave one star because mainly I am annoyed with their advertising. Did you know they spent 100 million dollars on advertising last year? I did try this app for 30 days and it was okay. I like khan kids way better and it is free. Also it works better for me when I am homeschooling.,
"It's a scam and they steal your money, I purchased from an add online that said 1 year for 45.00 and since there is no school for my 4 yr old I thought I'd take advantage on this great deal even though money tight right now due to pay cuts from work. ABC mouse not only charged me the 45.00 but then another 39.95 for a ""assessment center subscription"" wth is this? And I've contacted customer service 5 days ago and counting with no responses to this hidden charge. The app itself is slow and freez",
Used to love this app for my son but as of late the app stalls and I can't login or get it to work. I don't know if it was a recent update that has cause this app to stop working in my ipad and my android phone.,
"This app is so bad I put my card number in and everything (for my 4 year old son) and it has only been like an hour (my son has not been in it yet) and the game has taken at least 5,000 dollars from my card even tho I had it on the free trial ü§¨ I am very mad at this app and I feel like it is a scam so you should not get this app.",
This is a wonderful app that is very intentional and suitable for kids of all ages! It fully engages their attention and encourages them to learn in a fun and productive way. My three year old son and nephew loves this app. I strongly suggest this app to any parent!,
We have been using ABC mouse for yeara. This app does a great job of condensing the screens into a managable mobile interface.,
Good experience. Problems with loading material and freezing every now and again. But overall I like it.,
I just purchased this app in the beginning of April and I paid for a whole year. For the last couple weeks I have been unable to log in on any of my devices. When the app opens its says I need to sign up and pay again. What a waste of money.,
had signed up today and put my CC details with a visa card then said declined and had to use another CC same story declined. And still my daughter's can't use it on her tablet. Had checked my 2 credit cards and both were charged $1 plus in Aus..how can I cancel it..,
"I like the program so much, but it almost always freezes ... I have unlimited data and I don't have this problem with any other app üôÉ",
"This app is such a headache, every time my daughter try's to open the app it will not open, says it is loading g books, then page goes blank. So upset that I'm wasting money on the app, needs an update or something.",
I was charged for the month and the app doesn't load. It stays on a white screen. I've updated the app and it's still not working,
App is horrible. It's not allowing me to switch user so that I can get into the parent section.. therefore it's stuck on my oldest daughter's profile from when she was 3.. she's now 10.,
"I love this site. It's helping my 4 year old daughter who was really struggling about a year ago with colors, letters, and numbers. She now knows it all and just finished her kindergarten screening. The teacher was amazed by how much she knows!",
"I can not cancel my subscription, my password keeps being declined as wrong and the link keeps redirecting me to download the app, which I have. Horrible.",
"I like playing this more than my child! I dropped out in the 9th grade so it actually teaches me alot, even made my own account for 9th grade the grade i would've been in, I'm 28 now with two kids lol embarrassing but it really teaches me so i can maybe take the GED!!!",
This app is strat up a virus this app makes your other apps frezze and make stuff go slow plus the commercial is a lie they say they had it for 1-4 yrs but theyy actally had four a week or a mouth even my cuz downloaded this and they said it is the worst learning app. So dont download unless you want your phone to mess up and hav a virus,
"I have been seeing this program on TV, and I wanted to try it for my 5 years old just now I purchase the app and it is so slow it won't even load anyting can you please give me information on how to unsubscribe.because I do not see the use in paying for something that doesn't work,",
It has a lot of big issues. And sometimes really hard to navigate due to it being slow. Otherwise great educational resource,
"nightmare experience so far. I purchased a year & an additional assessment 4 $39.95 I have reached out 2 da support team many times 2 no avail. It has been over a month & no help. Support don't care. I need a refund @ dis point. Dis is da 2nd time I wrote a review da 1st time it was erased. Families have been devastated financially due 2 da corona pandemic & need a full refund da service is not working. Reinvest da revenue, profits, etc 2 fix da service so we can actually use it.üòµüò≥üßêü§Øüëéüèºüíî",
"Love it, but there is a lot of review for my daughters. We are homeschooling and this is a great addition to what we are already doing. I love the daily lessons at the top of the home screen in the banner. It helps it feel like a classroom.",
"Tried to sign up with the kids being home. I started online, put in all the info and never got to where i out in the code, was told to download the app... Well it charged me account at the free code didn't work and the appb won't load it just says waiting... For two days now!! So i came even stop payment or anything cause i can't get in???",
SUCH A RIP OFF! I cancelled my subscription and it says I didn't so it charged me when it wasn't supposed. Also never tells you it doesn't work on allobile devices so you spend your money for NOTHING. Free apps are better than this!,
Dont fall for there lies. they let a few select people get a full year subscription for 29.99 but everyone else has to pay 9.95 a month... BS!! And they dont care. dont waste your time and money on this app. it should of been free.. My kids learn more from YouTube Education videos then this .,
"Please I would like to cancel my subscription, my kids are not interested on the app. The graphics and the games are a little poor and do not capture the attention of my kids. Is to expensive.",
This is a great app for both my kids. Helps them continue learning at home after school without feeling like they are at school. They really like the fun aspect of this app in helping them learn.,
Having some issues with the submarine part she gets to one and it won't read that it's done right I've tried several times myself works fine till she gets to 31-8 and won't register she's on the number 31,
Used to charge $3 a month for assessment test now they charge $10 +$10 subscription or $99.95 for the year for the test. If only i can post a photo of the fees showing in my account. Rep. says $4 but NOPE its $10. Either the rep is dumb or his a liar. ITS $10 SUBCRIPTION +$10 ASSESSMENT TEST!!!!!! Thats $20 a MONTH,
My son likes it but t's a trap I signed up and a couple days later I was not able to get in from 3 different phones and a laptop. I Googled ABC mouse and clicked on news and saw that they just payed a 10 million settlement for trapped in people into the subscription. It's a no for me,
"when try to update it just spins, WON'T UPDATE, fix it, i paid alot of money for this and other affiliated apps for this to happen. fix this issue it's been going on for over a week now without resolution !!!",
This app used to work great.. but recently it doesn't load any activities or learning path.. nothing on it works anymore.. very disappointing.. will cancel subscription if this persists.,
It freezes up. So far we have not been able to utilize it because it buffers forever and sometimes doesn't open at all.,
"Tried to subscribe for a yearly subscription for my grand sons! Not a place to do that! Will use another app that's similar, cheaper and worked well for my children! If they don't want my business so be it!",
... I followed your suggestion. ABC mouse your contact information is a chat platform and nooneis responding. With all the money parents pay for your app. All you afford is chat platform with no response. This is ridiculous!. This is just a horrible experience!!.I just want my money back and a non renewal option.,
Can't get anything to work in customer service or support and forget about getting into my account information they have a lock on it. I set up payment through PayPal and will be contacting them to stop payments.,
"App finicky; constantly does not have info on the screen, it is blank when it should not be. You have to uninstall and reinstall all the time.",
Coloring pages don't load on any android device we've tried. We bought bubble coral for fish tank with the tickets our 2 year old earned and it never showed up in the rock list although the game took his tickets. I bought the annual membership and expect the bug worked out.,
"I have this app on my daughters iPad and it doesn't work or it tells me to try again or it goes to a blue screen an it stays there for along time and it has a ira glass it turns circles it's hard to get out of I payed money for it out of my card and I need my money back, my refund , or fix the problem I sent them 2 emails an nothing please help",
"Can't unsubscribe! The app is absolutely fantastic, but we have recently hit some financial hardship and need to unsubscribe... But can't find ANYWHERE that shows me how to do it! I tried the Contact Us page, but it's blank... Can someone help??!",
Tons of things for little ones to do and they have fun while learning too! The price is also amazing and incredibly affordable!,
"Becareful of the assessment subscription when you sign up. Canceled the subscription long time ago but charged ""assessment fees"" with no notifications just bills the account. Also the website has no way to navigate to account profile",
"I can't set up this app because it insist that I gender my child and I do not want an app deciding that my child should look at one particular game because he's a boy and not another game because she's a girl. All sounded quite promising before it insisted on gendering toddlers. Also not very happy with its insistent but it needs to know names and dates of birth, why is it trying to get a dossier on my 2-year-old child. Why is gender date of birth name all required before you can get into this?",
"My daughter is 5 and due to alot that has been going on her life she tends to be very hard to learn ... but with abc mouse she wants to learn and loves playing the games , taken care of her pets etc, thanks so much abc mouse !!!",
It's a great app but for the price of the annual subscription I wish it would load better on tablets and phones...sometimes it only works on the desktop,
App is good but why you charged 30$ fee of 6 months too earlier at the start of thee free trial month please reply me i am worried about this and the account shows that automatically you will charged again after 1 month but why ??? Please please reply me. I am trying to contact you but fail,
My kids absolutely love this app... They fight over who gets to play it 1st cuz they love it so so much. And they even want to play it after school! I haven't seen my kids this happy to play an app for school in a long time! Thank u ABC Mouse!,
"Ive never used this app but noticed today Ive been getting charged 9.95 a month for as far back as I can see, charged from my Paypal account, which I dont monitor super closely, so it went unnoticed. I smell a small claims case in my future",
"The app doesnt download properly and takes forever, very frustrating for our children who want to play with this app and I'm getting charged every month for this app...please fix your issues asap...so my son can actually use your app",
It keeps freezing constantly. I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work. Very frustrating,
I absolutely love this best 60 bucks I ever spent I didn't get the assessment center but my son is loving it he's recognizing letters now and he's learning new animals all the time ect if you value your kids education it's definitely a must have with this covid bullcrap going around because im scared to send him to regular school it has books and songs and games ECT I love that if I'm busy all day I can just flip it on and have it read a book to him before bed. Don't be a cheap ass and get this,
"Not impressed. Downloaded this on my daughter's tablet, worked fine through the sign up and payment process and once that was done, it crashes over and over and she can't even use it.",
This app isnt what I expected with the national crisis you would think the load screen would work better this app was recommended by my sons school I'm on a galaxy note 10 plus which I believe is one of the highest operating systems I cant figure out what's wrong.,
"Great content, when it wants to work. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple time and it still doesn't want to work and will not let me cancel it.",
"it constanlty does not work well. You log in and the screen is blank, you have to uninstall and re install over and over. Lots of wasted time.",
I tried logging in all morning. It does not go past the log in screen. If this keeps happening how do i cancel my subscription? So so frustrating.,
"Was just about to get this for my son during this virus so he could still do more learning, and the app doesn't work. Don't waste your money! Seems to be the app, because most of the ratings say the same thing. Don't let them convince you that it's your device.",
"I can't understand the problem, I download it using my wifi then when it is installed in my phone it indicates that I don't have wifi I am offline and that I should come back when I am online. Really funny!!! Please check this issue, thank you.",
Worst customer support ever! Running program on a brand new Dragon Touch. Most videos don't work. Words are garbled. And can't get any help. Forget about talking with someone! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,
I used this for my oldest who is 11and there are times she still uses it. She has learning disabilities and some of these are still beneficial for her. I am just getting ready to add a new profile for my 2nd daughter who will be 2 next month.,
"UK here. Not localised. Pricing is in USD. Meaning you'll get charged a conversion fee by your bank for every month. It's geared towards US children which is fair enough, it's a US company. ""Zee"" instead of ""Zed"" for example. My kids are already calling the bin lorry a ""garbage truck"" My point is: it's so heavily marketed on UK TV at the moment but does nothing to cater for the market/demographic that is asking for money from. Localise it and I'll bite but not until then.",
Just downloaded this as she got a free subscription from her teacher. App doesn't work on phone and the website barely works on my Apple computer. We spend most of the time refreshing.,
payed my whole year subscription and now it doesn't want to work. i contacted support and have not heard back. waste of money its just another scam app. very upsetting wouldn't recommend.,
A very good learning tool. Love spending time with my granddaughter exploring and learning. Great to see her achievements.,
"I paid for this app, and it has been working well, until many others started using the app, now I can't even get in to access anything at all. Even the website has crashed due to too many traffic",
"Love the app! My 4 year old says learning is fun, thanks to abcmouse. Id give it 5 stars if it didnt cost $ each month & if it werent so slow to do anything. Othrr then those little issues, its awesome!",
"Cancellation page does not work on mobile. If you do not have access to a laptop or desktop, avoid this app. It is slow to load games as well. Money NOT well spent.",
"Poor customer service. After several years of paying for this app, I canceled 1 day late & was basically told they can't refund my money, but i get 1 more year of their app that my daughter doesn't want or use anymore.",
Buggy mess. Super thirsty dark patterns. None of the pre-K reading activities ever loaded. PayPal failed the first time I tried to register. Maybe it's good on iPad but the android app is bad. Uninstalled.,
DO NOT BUY! Buy for a year and it automatically renews charging you for another year with no way to reverse or refund! My child did like using it all 2 years of wasted money! Don't waste your time or money!,
Please suspend battery play? Fast system voice is telling me to do things that don't make sense. I have tried to uninstall and reinstall to no avail. Buttons are reacting to any action I press. I can't even log in.,
There's not enough ..good things to say about this app...It's for the kids..I've noticed whoever made this..Has put into alot of work and detail...focusing on education..Also making it fun..So that the children take interest..Also that the parents approve..The learning..Thank you,
"This thing charged me for months undetected after I tried to cancel but it was the website version. I also have never signed up for ABC. Mouse in the first place as I am a teenager, and it somehow got ny information and got like 500 out of me before i realized.",
My twin girls love this app. I never have to tell them it's learning time they want to go on here. I like how it connects learning and games. I highly recommend this app for all age children.,
"So all in all other then having terrible luck getting my account straightened out the app seems like its pretty educational.My children have only been on the app1 time i tried canceling my subscription months ago to be techz when the trial was done and its yet to cancel im still being charged each month,ADDS UP after a while...PLEASE HELP ME and if possible help me with my full refund.Thank you kindly, Natasha N. Campos-Pack",
my kids love it when it works. It freezes up on them all the time and they have to restart whatever they are on. I'm glad we are on the free month because I probably will not be paying for it if it continues.,
"it doesn't boot properly. its stuck on the abcmouse intitial screen and never changes, nor does it show the log in screen.",
"Can not cancel the subscription, we haven't used it for over a year and I am sure I cancelled it. The app itself did not entertain my daughter for long. She prefers Starfall.",
Terrible billing practice. Auto renewed off the kids tablet without an email or subscription warning. However customer service contacted us quickly and will process a partial refund.,
It's a good learning program but I was charged for a second year without authorization when I had no plan on renewing do to app quality and my child's lack of interest in this particular app.,
I started seeing a progress in my four year old learning in less than a month and he also loves abcmouse!!! He ask for it even outside of our schooling time.,
My kids love it and it teaches the essentials. I see a marked improvement in school! Great program!!!,
Our Kids love ABCMouse!! We are a homeschool family and ABCMouse has been a great help for us in everyday learning. The tickets they are getting motivated them a lot to do more of studying. Grateful for this App.,
It's not opening anymore. It only worked for two days. Are you also aware that you charged me $59.4 even though I signed up for one month trial period. I am so disappointed!!!!!,
"Dissapointed. App lags, freezes up and becomes unresponsive. Galaxy Tab S3. No response from customer service. uninstalling.",
"I deleted this app within hours of purchase because after trying it, I didn't like it.... but my account was still charged. So what happened to the 30 day ""free trial""? I'd like my money back.",
I've paid for a year. I've been using it a long time. Now it won't install. customer service is no help. Upset. I did like it before. Used it on many tablets. Bought this tablet for just this reason. Wasted a lot of money. Upset.,
This app is horrible! It lagged so much! We had to keep restarting our device every few minutes. This app definitely needs to be updated.,
"!!!STAY AWAY!!! CAN NOT CANCEL!!! Cancelled twice, still being charged. I'm having to go to the bank to stop them from continuing to charge my account.",
Doesn't let me login. I just paid subscription and I can't even login in or reset the password it keeps glitching to the download page. Fix it or refund my money.,
AMAZING!!! My three year old love this app and honestly I do too. It helps him learn and they make it fun. He loves the hamster and fish. He really wants a hamster now. Thank you ABCmouse for such a great app,
About to cancel subscription as my little one has been able to click on puzzles that are suppose to be teaching her about certain things she is able to just click each piece and it falls into the right place please fix asap,
Its great! My son is 4 and 1/2 and with the covid-19 stuff going on he's been able to keep up with his ABC Learning and it has been great he also just loves taking care of his virtual pet hamsters and building them new cages!,
"**Users Beware** We've cancelled this app bc it doesn't work consistently. We haven't had a subscription for months, so why are you STILL charging US!! Customer Service is never helpful and never gives a straightforward answer.",
Absolutely love ABC mouse! So do my children & just when we think we've seen it all we find more games & they're all so fun & interactive. My 2 year old cries to play,
"Well it works maybe 1/3 of attempts. They don't have the bandwidth to support paying customers, very frustrating.",
Used to be great. Now it's so slow to load anything at all that we just turn it off. I'll have to cancel my membership if you don't fix your app. We're longtime customers that have used this with all of our children.,
I haven't used it in months and tried to unsubscribed but cannot get to it. It bullies you into wanting you to pay. Haven't used it in about a year and tired of being charged for it when I don't use it.,
I just download the app on my phone for my child and he couldn't even get to use the app.. The app took me straight to a page that said 403 error request blocked and I was so excited to try the app... How can I cancel this membership? I can't even get to the home page smt,
I can't even login because when you try to enter your login credentials the keyboard would not appear! Definitely not acceptable for such a big company to have such a big in the app!,
They do not know how to listen. i have emailed them and tried to go onto the site and end my subscription and they still want to keep taking money. i just got a ext sayig they to money out after 6 months. They WILL BE giving me y money back or i will be calling better business.,
"loading takes a long time just paid for 1 yr subscription but very dissapointed in how long it takes to load from one screen to the next great content,but toddler gets bored of waiting aswell as me have on Samsung s9 and Samsung tablet tried force stop and still same issue its really frustrating",
"Great App worth the Price. My 3 year old loves earning tickets by learning to buy toys for his pretend animals and room. Lots of books, songs, videos, puzzles, coloring,...everything you can think of.",
the app constantly locks up. I have tried on several different devices and same problem. very frustrating to me and my 3 year old,
I installed this app and it did not even show up on my screen but it took the memory from my phone. Doesn't even show up if I search for it. Now it says I have to install again when I have already installed it.,
The mobile app is beyond slow and doesn't respond to touch on cell phone. My child cannot use app on her phone...countless reboots to no avail will be uninstalling if persists...,
"app was working fine for a week now it wont open,i have uninstalled and reinstalled and still wont work only way to access it is though the abcmouse homepage it is very frustrating",
I wish I could give no star...money was taken from my account three times and not one person contacted me back about this. EDIT: I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOT JUST CANCELLING. There should be something that you'll can do to refund people this app basically stole from....replying and saying sorry doesn't mean nothing. I want the money refunded back to my account. This is complete nonsense.,
Its was okay in the beginning. But then it started to malfunction. It wouldn't load and it would take forever just to play a game. My son got bored with it. Unsubscribing now. Not worth paying monthly.,
The app was good at first. Now it doesn't even load. I tried with my data and even with WiFi. Im on a free trial. I better not get charged for an app my son can't even use.,
I paid for a year subscription & went to download the app & it gets to 80% then all of a sudden back to 0. It's done this all day!! What's the point if I can't even download it?!?,
"This app is trash. I downloaded it and tried it and doesn't work well. On top of that, when I tried to unsubscribe, it keeps going back to the home screen. So I'm paying for something that I can't even access üò§üò°ü§¨",
I purchased a FREE coupon on groupon for a free 2 month subscription and Abc Mouse took 50 dollars out my account. I didn't purchase anything currently trying to reach customer service but is not able to. I want my money back.,
"This app would be a fantastic tool for my child if it were responsive enough, some times the games and tasks are so slow that they are un useable.",
ABC mouse is the best thing ever my grandkids and I love it they get so much out it my new little grandson he's 3 months old and he loves watching the game and the kids and cartoons all the colors and sounds my grandkids think grandma is the best thing ever happen to them for getting it for them Don't miss out if your own kid's are all grown up now then get it for your grandkids Even if they are still babies they will love as they grow playing and learning watching thank you ABC mouse,
super slow response! i bought the subscription to this but it was painfully slow on my ipad and pc to the point where mu daughter would get mad and frustrated. i love the concept but hate the lag.,
app gets hang up sometimes and mouse get stuck with playing same page again. my husband says ita an app bug. but its interesting and good learning.,
This app is so slow on a Note 8 with ample storage. Too slow and very frustrating for intended audience.,
it's it's the best thing ever even helps you learn and it made me learn a lot of things when I went back to school I got A's evey day keep doing more make more activities more books those books are very funny I love this game so much and I like one that said 100% fun.,
"The app was good , but unfortunately my daughter uninstalled the app and she is not using it anymore, and I want deactivate my acct, because for months now you keep on debiting my account without the services being rendered.",
"User/subscribers beware: this app is made and paid for by the church of scientology. The money goes straight into the church of scientology who tears families apart. I too fell for this scam because I was desperate to help my son with his education. There are better options out there, just keep looking.",
i just made an account today and cant get passed the login in point the app isnt working nor the online page! so much for a free trial hopefully i wont be charged for an app that doesnt even work i guess ill have to reach customer service to cancel.,
Just downloaded the app because my older child loved it. I can't even get the app to open. It just sits and loads. Adventure Academy works just fine. I am really disappointed.,
I litterally so hate ths app because most of it like the songs r really dumb and the adds are one of the worsts of ths plus about the avatars somtimes look so rediculus and rlly weird lookin i am nver goin to ply ths game ever again because of the silly stuff it has it doesnt even help me learn anything it wants me to count to 100 but rlly i already know how to do that anoying stuff ths app totally sucks,
"Our school disteict gave us a code to use this app for free, but the App does not let you put any codes in until you add credit card info and agree to a billing cycle. Thats a scam waiting to happen.",
I entered all my credit card info on the PC just for it to load only blank screens. Had to download the app to end my subscription I never got to try. 45+ minute ordeal for my kid to only pick out his avatar and pets.,
"Downloaded this app following the recommendations of my son's teacher but after three days of fiddling with it, we still can't get it to load a lesson. I definitely would not recommend this app!",
"This app really works! My son is only two and a half and he loves it. He is learning colors, shapes, to recognize numbers even letters! He is having fun at the same time.",
"We absolutely love ABC mouce, the only problem i do have is that is glitches sometimes its only happened twice in the ten days ive used it and makes my son start the lesson over, other than its great and i will continue it and start my daughter on it.",
"Not worth the hype. It became too simple for my daughter immediately and didn't hold her attention. Also both the website and app feel clunky, like old flash player games we played in the early 2000s.",
It is very difficult to unsuscribe. The app is not working well on my phone and I have already been debited before the end of the 30days trial period.,
"This app sucks. My nephew rather play other educational games on another platform. And just so I can cancel the subscription, they MAKE you download their app. I guess thats how they make additional money.",
"So much for the one month free trial! You not only charged me immediately, you appear to have charged me for an entire year. I have uninstalled the app. Return my money.",
so i have not used the app yet. im annoyed already bc it says app is not optimized for my daughters tablet. then secondly i cannot access abcmouse material via internet..app only. seems silly. and disfunctional,
Great for brain development. Makes kids learn faster. Items for different age groups get mixed up frequently though.,
"Hello. I am giving this a bad review because when my mom is downloading it,it always says she is offline. We tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still didn't work. Please fix this issue.",
Customer service awful and wont help. No sound on desktop and wont even install on tablet. I talked to over 6 customer service people who only sent me an automated message and left chat. Problem was never solved and requested a refund. Waste of time.,
ABCmouse is amazing. My girls 5 and 2 really enjoy this app and im starting to see so much improvements with their learning. I would recommend this to my friends and family.,
"Please tell me why you charged me $60? I thought I was buying and educational app for my daughter, but....all I have is an app that doest load. And because it doesn't load I cant even cancel my subscription!!! Really $60 for wallpaper and spinning square, triangle and circle.",
"App keeps saying on our iPod that he's offline, but the iPod itself shows it's connected to the wifi. On my phone it won't even start. Anyway to fix this??",
"I am only giving you a star because, I want to write a review, you have stolen from me, I cancelled my subscription 2 months ago, you have charged my bank 3 times this month! Shame on you! I will never use your program again! And I will make sure I tell my friends also! Do not subscribe to this app, they will steal your money! üò†",
My daughter loves this app and doesn't want to put it down. Amazing educational app that my daughter expressed she feels like she's playing a normal game while learning at the same time. Perfect for her sitting her SAT'S next year,
Its a little slow to log in but that could be my device. Its beena great app for my daughter. Shes 3 years old and it took her a week and now she can manage your app with little issues. Thank u,
This app sucks. Constantly freezes. Cannot be used consistently or efficiently. Will be canceling.,
"worst app ever, canceled my subscription or so I thought was only able to contact some one through email who said that it was all taken care of to find out this morning they are still charging me for this service.",
had this for my son as a toddler now that hes out grown I'm not even able to cancel the subscription which I didnt want in the first place. I have to do it from this app and you cant even do it from the website. Really bad business ethics.,
"Must download the app to use. Attempted to download first on my tablet, then on my phone. WONT SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOAD ON ANY DEVICE. Already charged a penny (test I assume) and even that wasnt worth it. Please cancel my account now! If I cant use it, then I dont want it.",
Just bought this app and I can't even use it. Won't let me click on anything and tells me to turn off talkback which I don't have activated. Only happens with THIS app. Please fix this problem.,
This is a great interactive program that allows for your child to work at his or her own pace. The activities are engaging and well thought out providing a wide range of subjects including many your child won't get in traditional school. This is a great addition for online and home schoolers alike. Only complaint is I am in Canada and they allow for Canadian purchase so it would be nice to see relevant Canadian subjects and material. American currency isn't relevant to Canadian kids,
"My son is a very picky learner. All educational games and videos are and I quote ""boring"". ABC mouse captured his attention and kept it with their innovative pet park and hamsters. He loves to earn points to buy things for Able and takes great pride and responsibility in caring for him. Terrific app!",
this is one of the greatest learning experience that a child can have or that I can even learn I thank whoever invented this is very smart to know that this is a way to let children learn about all the things that they need to learn about and to do the thing that they couldn't do in school I thank everyone for learning the ABCmouse it is fabulous it is powerful it is great,
It's a great program. I think if they are going to market to people outside of tbe USA then they should be mindful of some stuff though. for example we are in Canada so it would be nice if things were relevant to Canada sucj as using Canadian money and not American.,
app wont work on my labtop im not really sure wht was going on but i am having the hardest time getting the app to work on my chromebook labtop i honestly saw the app and was excited to share it with my girls until i realized after putting in all my card information that the window had gotten way smaller so i uninstalled the app and tried it again this time i tried to sign in still no luck and it was acting really strande when i tried to log in....anybody else had this problem??,
Keeps crashing! Saying bad gateway on ever device we try to use! Freezing up. Not a very good experience so far!,
This app is a useful tool to help me homeschool at this time. I've been using the app for 2 months and am so happy with the progress my child had made. This app helps parent in planting seed of knowledge and is engaging for the whole family!,
on acer computer it shows on a very small screen and you cant even complete registration because it doesnt show the full screen. i paid for a $59.40 yearly subscribtion due to my son being out of school because of the covid -19 highly disappointed think i may have made a mistake!,
My son is three and it is a great feeling to have people say how smart he is. ABC mouse play a big part of our daily rountine. Thanks for all yall do to help us teach our kids at an early age.,
I love ABC Mouse. My grandchildren enjoy playing and learning. The children I babysit like playing too. ot is an every day activity for them. there ages are 2 -5. There are so many actives they never get board. Thank you ABC Mouse.,
Great for connecting dots in creative ways. Some things I skip but others we do again and again. lots of content.,
Didn't get a renewal notice at all check my bank and was hit with this. My kids no longer use this app and it would have been nice to have an option to cancel!,
"I feel, I really did not get to explore what I had got for my son as a trail. back in 2015 then my gmail got compromized,so I never got to use the app i ordered this again, been paying for 3 months, have not really used the app, when i tried looking into it, it would take me to different settings. I am trying to cancle this suscription, but for some odd reason it will not let me, is this in one of those beta test runs? If so they should not be allowed to charge anyone for the the use of a test.",
"i download this app and immediately my phone started making subtle quiet static noise, thats a huge indication of being bugged and i then saw apps open when i wasnt using it so yeah, had to factory reset as this app bugged my phone. hate it with a firey passion dont do it",
Great learning app to use when kids are not able to go to school. Works well some time freezes or have little trouble to load.,
Very glitchy and freezes most of the time. Frustrates my kids. Don't think I am renewing after the free trial due to this.,
Great learning app but I think the app is operating slow and freezes because there is too many activities. Consider making it a more simple app.,
it used to work fine.. it used to lag real bad on my daughters Amazon kindle fire..but worked great on my phone. now it wont load the learning path on either device,
Great learning program mixed with fun activities. App is glitchy and does not always load the next learning path.,
I am mad! Had an advertisement saying try for one month and pay $9.00 a month. I got for my niece with virus and schools closed. Once got on app. not what expected. I unsubscribed and called still took monies out today. I am in middle of filing a dispute need money refunded. Not good business at all have to follow through on promise to ex customer.,
Dislike the fact that you're paying almost a fortune for a learning for kids... i mean shouldnt it be free for kids to learn...!! dont like this bought another learning app for my daughter better quality and its FREE!!!,
My daughter seemed to enjoy learning while using this app. I wish they would offer the discounted monthly price as I cannot afford a larger one time payment atm.,
My 4 year old have been enjoying it since he was 3 and in early childhood development. Now he is in pre-k and we do readings and activities every night before bedtime.,
"I uninstalled this app. But im still getting charged for it. I no longer need this app. Please help me get this taken care of. My grandchild moved away, and i dont need this app anymore. And i really cant afford it. Im on a fixed income. Thanks for your help Darlene",
This is definitely the app you use to get your kids to next level of learning. My 2 year old twins loove this app and askbto use it every day. I get constant compliments on how advanced they are.. Love it!,
I love that my daughter loves to play this. Her vocabulary has improved since she has started and she is starting to recognize words as well!,
This app is a scam!!! I had the billing set up to come out of my PayPal and yet it charged my Debit card for some reason! Unless you want your money stolen dont use this app!!!!,
"absolutely not! I only came to ABC mouse bc the schools are closed due to virus and my son's teacher, gave us a code for free access, yet they're still requiring you're credit card you sign up. There are several FREE resources, just search",
it's not really set up for the age it says.. my daughter just turned four & can't really do the activities without help or just guessing.,
I'm not giving this app no star it's not worth because you keep on going and they will not stop taking from your bank account they don't tell you that it's not a game you have to just missing you don't read the books are the read-aloud is nothing that can help them. So children on the and they want to continue to purchase books and then you guys don't want to get the money back when we don't ever received the books we paid for,
Loads slow sometimes and can not play games offline very disappointing. Other than that we really like abc mouse.,
"Doesn't even work, it won't let me type anything in to log in. I signed up but can't even use the app. I've uninstalled it and then reinstalled it and still no difference.",
"My son enjoys learning, he always wants to learn from ABC mouse. I can already see his learning improvement in the short time learning from this app. Thank you ABCMouse!",
"I canceled my subscription back in October and they have charged my card every month, sent customers services an email and still nothing has been resolved yet they tell me my account is not active... would not recommend as they steal people's money",
My daughter absolutely loves the math and science. It is greatly helping her with her reading. I couldn't have chosen a better online learning app üòÉ,
I downloaded a free trial. Canceled before it ended and still got charged. I have since canceled 5 additional times and have been charged 5 times for an app I've NEVER even used.,
Excellent app with stellar education activities to facilitate learning of pre-kÿå KG and 1st grade that our daughter has been using and we enjoyed her growth with learning from this app. Recommend it to all parents who wants their child get the best of learning and growth,
"I subscribed last year. My kids only used it a few times. I forgot to cancel and they charged me for this year. Not only is it impossible to get ahold of customer support, I have to download the app just to cancel.",
Love love love ABCmouse. Easy to use. Fun for the kids and I love that it holds place. The kids HAVE to work their way through lessons. 5 stars!,
Horrible. Wrote to customer service about the app not downloading/installing on my phone and the response was to download the app and go through the settings to cancel my subscription. ü§î,
Can't unsubscribe for anything. Told to wait 25 hours before getting a response. Really don't want this subscription anymore and it's one thing after another to just unsubscribe. üòíüòíüòíüòí,
"I just realized one of the games the little robot does in the pre-k had the child pick out which letter is D. Then it asks to pick the little d.. my son picked the lowercase 'b' , and it said that was the correct choice for 'D' . That is not okay for someone that's just learning lowercase letters.",
"Cannot cancel my ""subscription"" even though i didnt know i had one. Downloaded the app to try do so and its terrible slow and there is no place to cancel",
this is very helpful working with my granddaughter with her speech and learning skills and she enjoys all the activities that go along with the learning. She gets excited to learn the next. Thank you,
My daughter who is 3 liked some aspects but oh my the amount of time this app froze she would finish two task and it would freeze she is a toddler and she would get fed up with it and just stop playing on it.,
I just bought this app. I cant get in! How am I supposed to cancel if I cant even get in! Horrible company. There better be another way to cancel. I'm not paying for something I can't use!,
False #2 top free app when its only free for one month. You have to pay for this app should really take the top free app off bc its not free. Disappointing. Ill stick to pbskids tha is actually free like it's advertised,
What a joke... my son can't keep his attention on this because it takes 2 minutes to get from screen to screen. Requesting a refund. This is obviously a common problem per other reviews. Maybe fix your app?,
"Just got this & it looks great, but my grandson's avatar is bald! The hair option did absolutely nothing. I tried several times. I completed the rest of the avatar. He needs HAIR!",
Idc if i'm 10 in a half i actually love it! Its very fun and addicting so don't judge me i love it so much i love art so i mostly do art i made a awsome picture of a horse in real life out of a book and it looks amazing i was hoping to show it to my 5th grade classmates when i get to go back to school after 2 years,
If I can if it zero I would.My child doesn't use this app and yet got charge a whole year subscription and can't get ahold of anyone to speak to and no offer of a refund. Thanks for taking my money for free.,
This app worked fine for a bit. Then constantly struggled to load. Poor resource management if you need to constantly Uninstall and reinstall.,
"I was disappointed when I opened the app, most of my screen was black except a small square and it won't let you click on anything.",
"Hard time login to the site. same problem for five years with no help. I would like to drop this app, but it has a hold on my account. Need to stop it!",
"My toddler loved ABCmouse. The other day she happened upon the book ""About Cows"" in the toddler section of the ABC Mouse library. I was quite disturbed when I heard the narrator cheerfully read that ""beef comes from cows""...this was not a conversation I wanted to have with my child about her favorite animal this young. They we're totally unhelpful and said there was no way to filter out access to that book.",
Must fix my review They fixed it once I finally got a hold. My son had some excitement from this app but mostly just started getting more hands on with the library. To each their own,
"Frustrating! I downloaded the app. It won't let me make an account. I'm new to this app.. Truly don't make since.. only gives the members log in option. So how do I make an account??? Iv heard so much about it and wanted to try it out with my son, he is a 18 months.",
I do not know why but I have tried several times to log on with my password I reset my password and tried to log on but there was a no go so I think I am just going to quit and try to get my money back because they did set up an account but I cannot get to it I know what this is a good app I don't know if my devicees are not up to par or what but I would recommend this to anyone that has little children and decent devices.,
Every time I go to get in they say password is wrong. Can you help. I've gone thru reset and it still does not work. I used babygirl1 for password,
"The toddler I take care of absolutely loves ABC Mouse and loves the songs, the pictures to color, and the farm animals, every activity is geared to his level and he doesn't want to stop.",
Very educational also very helpful in a learning environment only issue I have is it would freeze and not be able to be used depending on the day we would have to wait and come back another day despite this issue we still love this site,
The app just loads continually after I login. It never does anything! I've always heard great things about ABC mouse and this is my first attempt at utilizing it. Very disappointing,
I love this app and so does my daughter its wonderful and has helped her go from PreK to Kindergarten learning and shes only 4. Unfortunately her tablet broke and we are having the worst time finding a new reasonably priced tablet that is compatible with the app if anyone has suggestions on a tablet please let me know,
Horrible company I cancelled and they still charged me and wont respond to any emails I only get auto reply that give me instructions to download the app and do a bunch of other stuff but it still wont cancel! I want my money back!,
I've downloaded this app several different times and on different devices and it still won't let me log in and seems to keep glitching.,
"Very slow, inorder and complicated app. Lot of free apps available in the market. Go for those. Not worthy to buy.",
I am very dissatisfied with this app. It freezes and it loads for hours.I have updated the app and the issues continue. I will cancel it today.,
"this is a scam!!!! they will not cancel your subscription or reply to you and there's nothing you can do. I will have to sue then so they will stop charging my account. they are cheating people out of their money. do not subscribe, it's not worth it even if you didn't want to cancel.",
"Awesome! Being a only parent and Truck driver, I was concerned about my son's education. ABCmouse has been an awesome tool. He has excelled greatly, and at 4 years old he's got a first grade level. Thank you.",
Really helps our daughter with severe autism retain information. Our other kids love it also and are advancing quickly! We highly recommend ABC Mouse!,
"App is pay only. They let you try it for 30 days free but only if you enter credit card info. Looks like a good app, but no thanks. I hate this gimmick.",
Don't waste your money on this app. Besides all the freezing and constant reloggin in for my child I don't even feel it provides a good learning experience.,
Best investment for our kids by far. Speeds up or slows down based on your childs knowledge and stays engaging and fun for our kids. Thank you ABC Mouse!,
Tried cancelling it before we even finished setting the app up all the way and surprise! I was charged this morning for an app that wouldn't work well on my phone.,
It been great learning with my child is always . At least in this lockdown mychild is busy thank you very much Could you please look for a learning program for children at 11-13that is class 6-8,
It keeps freezing and I continue to redownload the app. If your a paying customer this shouldn't be happening.,
Somehow they set me up for automatic billing and charged me nearly hundred dollars without my knowledge. We haven't even use ABC mouse in over a year because the app never works properly.,
I don't feel like my kids learned a thing. If they would remove the pets on the app. It would not distract them as much. Any one relate?? Or add an option to remove it for some kids.,
My daughter loves the app and I don't mind paying the monthly subscription price but for two months in a row I've been charged twice. Other than that it's a great app.,
Can't sign in. I put the correct email and password and do the math question then it sends me back to the sign in or sign up page. My child wants to use the app but I can't get it to log in.,
"Love this more than words can say, and my son who is 2 years old also loves it so much very user friendly thank you again hope to have it for many years to come and I hope it comes with more and more improvements but if not it is togreat the way it is definitely worth the money",
Extremely disappointed. I cannot access ANYTHING. It keeps freezing on every device I've tried.,
We just recently got an account. I really like that you can create a profile for up to 3 kids. But I have no idea where to add a voucher I got AND it LAGS A LOT!!! Which is not great for inpatient kiddos!!,
Paid for and downloaded app. App will not load after login on any device. A lot of money not to be able to use it. REQUEST A REFUND. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.,
"pretty upset I signed up 3 days ago, for a 6months trial. and I have not been able to open the app on my laptop, phone, and tablet. complete waste of money.",
Its easy to cancel is what they'll say.. you need to go to parents page and then locate the needle in the haystack to cancel.. Update... I called customer service and a nice man was more than helpful canceling our service!,
This app is a real time waster it is really fun for my kids and it helps them learn and my little ones are falling behind in school but now with abc mouse my little guys are catching up!!!,
"i want to rate this 5 stars but for some reasom it wont load pass the abcmouse screen no matter what i do. i have updated it, i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it. thankfully i can get in through the website. please fix issues my kids love abcmouse",
Its a great program but runs choppy and slow on tablets. Needs a full parental lock feature. It has a lock but it cam be easily bypassed.,
"app either doesnt open, takes forever to load or is very slow. very disappointing especially since we are charged for this application",
I cancelled my subcription a year ago i was surprised to have it taken out again this year and unable to find a number to call i sent a message but need the money asap its really frustrating we cancelled as soon as we set up a subscription so we only paid for a year,
I loved when it was free during the beginning of the pandemic but I don't understand why it cost money now it just made me a little mad so I deleted it because after the time it was free it was fun but i went to go play it today and it cost money now so I'm a little mad,
"my daughter really really enjoys this app. The information taught was at a lower level than what she educated to, but she stuck with it and it caught up now she is actually learning and it's fun to her",
It should be for toddlers!!! I mean I got it when I was 7 and right now I'm 8 and I could just find a way where it's not it's almost no learning plus the game's pretty bad anyway that's why I'm only giving it 2 stars,
Great when it works but buggy and often gets stuck loading. Very frustrating for both 4 year old and parent.,
"I can not log into the app!!! When I logged into the website, I am unable to perform any functions, it tell me to download the app!!! Terrible app I can not log in and cancel my subscription.",
I was looking for a free app. This claims to be free but once it's on your device you have to difficulty using your phone again. You shouldn't have to lie to get people to try your product. Free means free no charge right?,
I download this app for my daughter... And i sign up and after signing up its saying that am offline and nothing is wrong with my internet.... ABCmouse needs to fix this issue. Before i take drastic action.,
They are charging me for this app and i am not nor have i ever had this service. I have tried over 9 times to get in touch with someone to tell them but all i keep getting is a voice recording. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!,
Annoying experience I used the 30 day free trial. My kids liked it very much so I paid 29.95$ for a year trial on March 11. Then the next day the took 3.95$ of my pay pal account without my permission. I will be looking into this... makes me want to cancel. Waste my time abc mouse . Can't deal with the bull cram I I to busy for that,
Haven't been able to log in over a year says account was no longer valid and wake up to my bank overdrafting when I prepaid for 4 months over a year ago and never put I wanted a reoccurring charge! Now there closed till Monday!! Really mad!!!,
Cannot use since update was published. I got an android 9 tablet just to run this app on the subscription and cannot update. I uninstalled and cannot reinstall.,
"It said install app. When I installed, it says Your App will be Installed on your device soon. It should be Installed immediately. Not at all happy. I subscribed for free trial. I want to close my account now.",
"I am unsure what changed, but it now always says my kid's time for the day is expired, and says my login password is incorrect to add more time. Tried reinstalling, same issue.",
very good app my 5 year old says this is fun and helps you to focus in school. This is game is very educational and there many good activities inside. the companion apps are really nice as well.,
I have had this app before and it is amazing. It has everything you need to teach a little kid and it's also fun as you go along and choose what you learn as you have fun doing it.,
"We love this app but I'm confused about something. When I log in on my husband's iPad it asks for $60/year. On the website and any other device, it wants $80. Why? Fix it and I'll update my rating.",
The abc app finally downloaded then the app would not allow information to be filled. I'm not sure how to resolve the issue or if it can be fixed.....,
I did like the app up until recently.. U guys chargerd my card 3 times for i dont know why i only have one subcription The app is constantly frezzing.Im unable to do anything its crazy Im hoping u guys fix the problems ty. üëâüëâüëâUPDATE:. THEY RESOLVED MY ISSUE. IT WAS A MISTAKE ON MY ENDüëàüëàüëàüëà,
"I still remember my parents having this app for me when I was younger many years ago, it was so magical for me as a child and didn't feel like learning (please do this for middle school aged students)",
The app won't load. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and now it won't let me log in at. I've never had issues before so this was very frustrating.,
"Our four and seven years old love the ABC Mouse and I love it as the pre-K homeschool teaching extra material for my teaching. The best thing is, it's so easy to make them study by telling them, ""Go play ABC Mouse! """,
"My grandson is so excited with ABC mouse he's 4 years old, and he's learning to read and have better coordination for when he goes back to school. Thank you ABC mouse!! Happy to be part of your company. The Ellington family",
this is the best program for teaching my preschooler! as well as my third grader theyve learned so much and are ahead of other children! what a blessing since co-vid! thank you abc mouse!,
User friendly. My daughter loves and has been making good progress in math. Good curriculum for site words.,
"The program is educational. However I forgot my password and I keep clicking ""forgot password"" and I never receive an email to reset. I than emailed customer service and waited 15 days... no response. I'm at a loss now stuck paying this app.",
"The app itself is educational and thought out. However it is not keeping the interest of my daughter. She has no desire to open the app on her own, or play without being asked to.",
The screen doesn't format for a mobile device and keeps freezing. I cannot even log in. App needs serious fixing.,
both my kids (five and two) love ABC Mouse! its really helping my oldest prepare for kindergarten in the fall and I was shocked at how much material and activites they actually had for my youngest.,
It's seems to be frozen frequently which is frustrating. On the other hand my kid is super into it so when it does work she loves it,
"Slow to load, locks constantly, do not buy! No technical difficulty, just a laggy app on a brand new tablet with ads even with a paid subscription",
"I bought the program for $45, within one week in email to the customer support team as, the kids not interested so refund, but so far didn't refund for me. Pls asap refund to me, ticket ID 4989471. Send email to customer support, the email automatically delete from our send box. Too bad..",
"eveything runs SOOO slow!! and its very hard to navigate for a 4 year old, especially to find the learn to read books area!",
Won't let me un subscribe now and cancel future payments.. I've tried everything and looked everywhere for an out option with no luck.. I better not get charged with this apparent scam,
"BEWARE!!! I signed up for a 1 year membership, now 6 years later I realize they have been charging me for 5 years, without my knowledge. Pretty deceitful, since my 5th grader has no use for this app. HORRIBLE WAY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS!!!!!!",
"The app is is slow and freezes way too much. My kids like it but its just too slow to keep them engaged. Also, can you make all the books read aloud?",
"This app is awesome. My daughter has learned so much, and it's updated with all the updated events. I was surprised to see the women month section. We love it!",
"Great learning tool for my 4 and 8 year old, however, recently the app stopped working in the Samsung tablet. Hope a fix comes soon.",
"I was supposed to get 2 mo free subscription and not pay until the 19th of Aug and I noticed today I got charged so basically only got a month free, my daugh6is not interested in the app so I'm trying to unsubscribe but it doesn't let me.",
"This is listed as a ""top free"" app. After you download it, it says its 10$ a month. It dosent say there is a price anywhere before downloading. Very deceptive. I do not reccomend.",
This is such a wonderful app... It's great for casual learning and homeschooling. It also helps by giving access to other learning apps. Great investment!,
We love it. The different grade levels for each kid is awesome. It has different activities for them to learn.,
"App is ok. Didnt keep my busy ones engaged at all. Ive tried to cancel, talked in to suspending until nov. And figured out ive been paying for it anyways. Was mislead and lied too.",
I love it my daughter that is seven has been learning more she is only in second grade but she is a very good at this she is certainly loves the learning path it is her favorite you can put more updates cuz she certainly loves it and wish there was more updates,
"Locks up, lessons do not load. Not using kids mode. Slow loading. Having issue on more than one device.",
My daughter loves this app it really has helped her she is about to graduate from prek and is at the top of her class new everything they were teaching before hand because we were using abc mouse and still are.,
"Difficult to start using. Been working at it for a while. I've lost interest, so for sure my kid will too, if opening it is so diffult.",
i also tried the free month and its been over a year and ive bee trying to cancel this for late 4 months now and it's not doing anything to let me do it so i keep charging my account 13.89 im getting sick of it im very üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò† i no i wpnt be reimbursed cuz this is just retarded I've had this thing for I think it's been like 8 months I was okay with it for the first couple of months cuz I wasn't noticing it but now it's I'm done and I tried to get ahold of customer service I've tried 2,
"Can't get the app to work on android. Overall not happy with abc mouse. The app should work, not lock up your phone!",
Worked just long enough for my daughter to really start to interact with it. Seemed like she was learning alot and now the app wont even load.,
complications. this app refuses to download. i signed up and paid from the website and dued to this problem i tried to cancel my subscription and now im unable to reach customer service to cancel.,
Please fix the freezing on this app I'm trying to get my boys to get on a it always takes like an hr just to set them up I paid almost $90 dollars for this app not to work I love the app I've had it over the years and I'm so disappointed in how it is now please fix,
App is broken and unresponsive even after restarting and uninstalling and reinstalling. You have to cancel through the app and its not working at all.,
"This app is always freezing & I can't find my daughter's prizes or things she's bought with her points. The activities are fun for her, but why put features on there that don't work?",
This app is the worst. Why do you make it hard for someone to cancel their subscription? I have failed to use it yet I still get charges from my account being paid to ABC mouse. Kindly cancel my subscription. I don't want to use this app!!,
Excellent app. We've had it for a few years. Our three year old learns so much. We also love the other apps we get free with our ABC mouse paid subscription.,
"Its impossible to cancel. Ive been charged for MONTHS thats not being used. The app wont even start up, can not get ahold of anyone to actually cancel by phone.",
"Don't even bother! It doesn't work at all. Doesn't download, nor anything. Tried several devices. Same issue. Don't waste you time nor money",
"just paid for a year and it wont work. Half the screen is glitching and the other half wont allow me to type. Ive downloaded it 3 different times life suggested in comments below, but it still does not work. now i have an upset 3 year old.",
Since the update it locks up every time my son finishes a page in his learning plan. I have to close it completely down. Not going to renew if this isn't fixed,
"As soon we open the app, it closes itself out. It just started doing it since the last update. We can't use it at all. My three year old is super bummed.",
The app runs very slow on my Note 8 and also our tablets. Its is constantly freezing and not responding.,
My little sister loves it and she got to 100 percent she is 3 and there were no glitches and it was super easy I'm 8 I played ABC mouse before and let me tell you something it was fun this is fun and educational at the same time wow thanks for this appüòÅ,
"its fine until he gets to a certain level then it freezes up wont load cant go any further and even the game is saying ""youve done this level 5 times today"" well yeah cause it wont load",
I just paid for a yearly subscription and I cant even start the app it keeps going to landscape mode and portrait mode constantly as I log in to start,
we couldn't even use the app because it would not download and I can't cancel my account because it has to be done in the app. I had to stop payment through my bank until.,
I just downloaded this app yesterday and it keeps saying error can't never get into the app....wow doesn't appear to be all that was advertised so far...sign up but cannot get in,
"Age cut off is 1st grade not age 8 which is 2nd, sometimes even 3rd grade. They refused a refund. Thanks for taking $9.95 for something I can't use! False advertising!",
My daughters education has improved during the 2 months that she's been on it I've seen a lot of progress and when she started school the teachers notice the level in education she was which was exceeding at her age.,
"Loved the games, but the app has completely stopped working. Lots of freezing and loading. App is unusable at this point. Money on membership wasted.",
"This app us not openings on my daughter's galaxy tab 3. There is wifi present but it keeps saying no internet connection. I have tried to reboot, uninstalling the app then reinstall the app but that does not help. What do i do?",
ABCMouse's incentive based learning has been a nice compliment in my kids schooling. They are enthusiastic and view it on par with tv and gaming.,
"My 6 year old says she pretty much likes everything. Especially the reading, science, and math, cats and exploring. Kids should definitely get this app. And she says it should be 100 thumbs up.",
"Amazing,awesome and great it is really fun and educational we love to do ABC mouse all day! The only thing I want about this is in the learning path I wish it was real that would be so much fun.",
Freezes constantly. Takes 10 minutes to even load the application everytime you open it. And they put so many pets on the game that my daughter won't even stay on the learning path. Waste of $70!!!,
Love this app. My daughter is about to turn 4 and has been using this app since she was 2 and has yet to grow tired of it. I've definitely seen the benefits of her using this. Highly recommend!,
My child loves it. The only thing that we don't like is it freezes and after a while of it keep freezing she goes to noggin instead. So I'm not sure if we are going to renew this next year or not.,
It doesn't let me install it. I got rid of ALL my games and I still can't install! If they don't fix this I'm going to be on prodigy where I have a member ship account üò† ruffüêïüê∂,
"SO SLOW. It's only been a day, I'll update my review. It's great content, but my daughter wants to give up already because of all the crashing and slowing",
I haven't been able to get this app to work I'm stuck with a blank screen once I log in on computer and lab top . I really wanted my son to play this but it doesn't work,
Horrible i cant cancel my subscription and they keep trying to charge my card. They have tired to charge my card 5 times in the past 2 week . Stop it or ill report you. Update they are still trying to charge my credit card . You guys don't give up,
My children used to strugle and did not want to do it but know they love it and want to learn more and more by the min. Also they love this app and I do as well to help them learn to get in higher grades,
This is the worst app ever. I experience lagging on every device we use it on. The delay is so significant that none of my children like to use the app.,
"I'm not a teacher, just a mom. That was proven at the earliest possible stage of the pandemic. This App is a life saver for an otherwise stressful situation. My son loves it. I don't know if there's anything better than ABCmouse",
All 3 of my kids use this app everyday as a part of their school material. It has been nothing but helpful. And my kids look forward to learning with this app.,
I downloaded the ap not only on my childrens tablets (All 3 to be exact) but ALSO my phone; it wont even open! I was so excited to finally be able to get this for my kids! For them not to be able to use it. Extreamly Not Happy!,
It's a great app that keeps my kids interested! There are so many different activities to keep them engaged and they actually enjoy learning!,
App issues. There is a voice assistant that won't go away and it keeps freezing.,
Doesn't load reading on any of my android devices. Samsung galaxy 9 plus and Samsung galaxy 10 plus. The whole point of me downloading the app was for the reading. Garbage.,
This app is extremely glitchy and honestly very boring with repetitive assignments. Definitely not worth the money in my opinion!,
"I loved this app for my kids, until today. Now it won't load on my tablet. I left it for over 30 minutes, never loaded. It's always taken a while, but this is unacceptable, especially since I am paying for it.",
"App never worked, canceled it and they still charge my account. I am contacting the BBB. This is down right criminal. Crappy app crappy customer service and they will take your money even after you cancel there service",
Update: I have cancelled several times and you're still charging me!!? How can and educational app be doing something like this? How is this app charging my credit card when I don't have an active subscription???,
"Delete my card or payment method, or even my account from existence. I don't feel secure simply leaving it inactive, only to find myself being charged later after a couple of years.",
I'm sad that I have to give this even one star I am so tired of sitting on the phone or online for hours at a time trying to get someone to fix the glitches in this system I depend on this as a tool teach my children at home. I've paid my subscription and have not been able to use it in over a month,
Installed the app and put my all my payment info in and then opened the app and no I cannot even have a full screen and eneter in mine and my childs info or even cancel my subscription. I want a manager to respond and my subscription to be cancled ASAP!!!!!!!,
Of course I finally sprung for the subscription and now it does work? Have it on 2 devices and doing the same thing. Go to log in and then it freezes.....can I have my money back?,
"Perfect. I found this app safe for my child and educative My child is being home-schooled, so she can learn from an educative application. Rather than installing some crappy applications that I don't know of, I can consider this app known by millions of people. Keep up the good work!",
This app is terrible! After a good 5 minutes it froze then it kicked us offline and I have not been able work it since.,
"Great app. The only thing I do not like is that the virtual child can not interact with the things in the room (example, sit down, lay down....).",
"Doesnt increase screen size - unable to use!!! I want to cancel the subscribtion! This is not worth $1, and you want $155.88 a year!!",
"Can login because the login screen bus bugged, can't access account online. Unethical run app that's easy to pay for but hard to cancel. Stay away!",
Game froze the first day I got it now 5 months later it still is frozen n continues to charge my card but won't let me deactivate account so now I'm being charged every month for an app I'm not using not even had a chance to use it very mad üôÑüò°,
my son and daughter love this app but after updating it i had to log it in and forgot the password so i sent a request to recover it but i never received a email its been two month and i am still being charged for a account i cant access. I have tried to contact support only to be ignore and i have tried to recover the account many times but never received a email. I liked this site/app but no longer want anything to do with it and id like my money back for the last two months.,
I tried to sign up for the app but when putting my billing information it would not let me enter letters for my postal code only gives me the option for numbers. So disappointed.,
So I've now paid a year subscription for something that doesn't work. And on top of it it is impossible to contact support on this app! That's my hard earned money!,
We used ABCmouse for years then when Disney took over it just became another advertising platform. ABCmouse isn't into education as much as making money. Needless to say we do not use their app anymore.,
"I never sign up for a subscription and yet they've been taking my money these past months. Not ok, especially during this pandemic all school apps are free except this one.",
My 4 year old grandson is way ahead on his vitual learning because we started this in March...my 2 year old granddaughter is added at no additional cost. Covid cant stop learning thanks to this great app!!,
"Very great app even for the little ones who won't sit down for a second , my daughter never wants to sit ;concintrate or learn anything new ,but got into this app within the first 5 minutes √¨üôÑüòäüòäü§ì",
"Zero stars!! Worked when I downloaded it, then it stopped. For such a large app, its frustrating to struggle with it.",
"Was working fine for months. Now when I open it on my phone, there's a lady's garbled voice speaking over it and I can't log in. Delwt d and reinstalled and still am having priblwmy",
"#1........ my grandkids didn't understand ANYTHING on this app! #2......... because of #1, i cancelled my subscription in October of last year, and i just see where they started taking money from my account again!......",
very nice. It doesn't work too much with the kids writing abilities. But the kids really enjoyed getting to play the games and it's educational.,
"I've been waiting and trying for over 3 hours to download ABC Mouse app for my trial period and it won't allow it to download. I'm very, very disappointed and it's not appropriate for my child's age. I need to know how to cancel my trial period so I won't be charged after the trial period and it won't download. I actually give it no star because the app wouldn't download. I had to click on a star so it will allow me to post this review.",
"My kids love this app and they actually learn so much from it. Really worth the money, also great if you have a tight wallet cuz of all the offers they have.",
We have been using ABCmouse for 6yrs now and my kids absolutely loves its. We are a homeschooling family and my kids have learned so much. Like any developing and evolving programs there comes bumbs in the road.,
It helps with sucheracaron and times it is so much fun they never run out of ideas for games and books I'm still have not played all the games and I've been playing for a year achurle almost 2 years.,
How am i supposed to get full benefit of this app and give it a rating if i cant even log in... The login screen does not rotate and i can't enter anything. This is ridiculous.,
"This is the best App you can imagine! Not only is it the best App but you can learn, read, and have fun altogether!!! - Aniyah (5 years old)",
Having problem getting in the website paid and everything and still won't let me get my son started on the app on phone. So I try to cancel and get a refund and i am not able to i hope they get this fix,
"We love ABC MOUSE for our daughter. We only wish each activity gave her more tickets. She loves building her hamster cage and changing the layout. Especially now with COVID, it's just what we need.",
This game takes long time to load. When it has load the screen turns blue and freeze. I wish that it would work.,
"Very unhappy! With the schools shutting down due to the virus I decided to do the free trial. After asking for my credit card number, I noticed they charged my account for the full year. How is this a trial?. This is taking advantage of the situation where parents are currently not working and students are not in school. Very disappointed!1",
Constantly freezing on the tablet. Wont allow us to switch users without freezing. Horrible purchase.,
No app on home screen. It says I'm offline when I'm not. Very frustrating for a grown adult only imagine what it would be like for my 3 year old.,
"The app is great if you can get it to work, I was using it all day with my son. Now it will not load on my Android phone. I have uninstalled and reinstalled nothing! I'm stuck on the logo. It will not load any advice? I'm using Android 11",
Takes so long to load everything. Like several minutes for each time you click on something. Way too long for my three and five year olds.,
My 5yo daughter loves ABCmouse. She started using the learning app at 3yo. She will start Kindergarten in the Fall and enjoys the classroom activities. She is currently learning 1st-2nd grade material.,
"Ended up unsubscribing after 10 mins. The stupid app wont load passed a certain point. I've tried on my phone, and all the tablets. Waste of time.",
this game is good when it works its very fustrating when its doesnt work or load or do nothing and i want my acount gone its not worth any. money i hardly got to play this it wasted a lot of time wast of time waiting for this to work very upset at this. I am not,
I love it so much cuz you can ask your daughter or son to play it set it out and then you have to do your emails and stuff and I love it so much cuz you can ask your kids to play it it's a learning game it'll make the kids smarter to get 100% download it now,
Just bought the subscription. I dont have a mouse for my labtop and cant download the app on my phone or tablet. It is very hard for my 3 year old to use my computer. Please fix the app,
Love the experience my child is getting with this app. But now it will not work and she has a brand new Samsung tablet this started in the last couple days,
3 year old can use this app to access the app store to install anything he wants. The simple swipe right for parents is too easy to get past.,
"Stopped working on Android. Keeps saying ""suspend talkback"" even though I don't have Accessibility features on. I can't click on anything to login.",
The app will not work on my phone. I have deleted it. Uninstalled and reinstalled it. Restarted my phone. Nothing seems to work.,
"My daughter was crushed when school was canceled last year, and the online wasn't making the same impact as in person learning. ABCmouse kept her up to speed and happy.",
This is the worst app and worst experience I've had in my entire life. I would not recommend this app to the devil because this app is the devil. I did not sign up for ABC mouse. My child has not watch nor did anything with this app. So every morning I have a notification from my bank card saying ABCmouse is trying to take money off my card. I just downloaded the app to see why are ABC mouse This app is a rip off I don't want it!!!!!!!!!!! I wish like hell they leave me tf alone!!!!!!!!!!! Scam,
What? Bugs! One time i gone to the learning path i clicked some where afterwards the child went completely off the screen meaning i had to reset the my hole phone i also clicked on a sheet and would not show .........ABC MOUSE PLEASE FIX THISü§¨üò°,
My grandaughter absolutely loves this! Great early education program. Best purchase I've made in a while honestly. So pleased! Keep up the good work ABC mouse.,
"I suspect this app may be a scam. okay, not a scam, but it's a terrible app, and they make it very difficult to cancel you account.",
Haven't even gotten a chance to use it yet. For some reason while doing avatars it decided to give my oldest's (who I did first) my youngest's avatar and not give my youngest one at all. Now I have two upset kids with special needs because it isnt allowing me to give my youngest one at all.,
I love this app! It's so many educational and fun ways it teaches my daughter. She loves it and we had it since she was 3 years. I recommend it for all parents,
"My daughter (4y.o) loves this app so much and I can tell that she is learning a lot more. However, the app keeps on crashing.",
"This program has been fun, educational and highly recommended! My grandsons love completing their assignments and receiving special prizesüôÇ,,, most importantly they retain the information,, thank you ABC mouse..",
"I JUST paid for and downloaded the app, and it won't even open! Is there a way to cancel my subscription from a web browser? I WILL NOT pay for something I can't even access to use...",
10 dollars! Thats insane for somthing i can use for free on a computer... Dont get unless you want to pay money for somthing you can use for free this is a scam never get they steal money and your credit card information Please dont let them scam you.,
Wonderful app. Was super impressed how my 4 and 5 year olds learned so fast. Colors shapes letters galore. Great for breaks off from school also.,
Its great for my 3 year old but there is some things I dont understand. One of them is that she gets logged off after a day. Over all it's a great app,
App is very slow and doesnt work well on tablet. Wish i only signed up for 30 days free instead of paying for all year,
"Great when it functions properly. Today learning path isnt working. It brings your there, tells you to select the activity, but theres nothing displayed",
"Amazing, innovative, and a great tool for both my kiddos tohave fun while adding to their education. Seems to have put my children ""ahead of the rest"" giving them educational value and advantages for life. Cannot say enough about this! -very satisfied mom of 3",
"I just purchased this app early this morning and there's someone on the app talking in a weird voice and when I tap the green button ""get started"" nothing happens.",
Kinda sucks on my BRAND NEW Galaxy Tablet A8. Wont start or is SUPER SLOW and freezes. Please fix because i got this tablet mainly for the kids and i need to start looking at learning options. =(,
great app I LOVED it I wanted to get the app again but I couldn't login and I watched the video and it did not give me to get 30 days for free so kept replaying the video but still so I got angry I gave up so if you want to pay I would not because for me it's expensive so uhm I would rather not get the app if you don't want to pay.,
app is so slow. Cant get my 2 yr old to stay focus to try to get through a lesson. was looking forward to doing activities with him...disappointed :(,
ABC MOUSE is a great way to encourage children to enhance their learning experience. I'm a grandmother who has always believed in education and this assists me when I need that extra learning tool!,
I've paid for and setup an account now the app won't install on my phone. I've done all the basic troubleshooting I've been trying over and over. Please help or give me my money back,
This app is phenomenal. It's easy enough for my 4 year old to navigate himself and he's learned so much while his brothers work at the table. He's even able to share facts we may not have known.,
Great learn app esp during the covid-19 situation. Easy for my child to learn and to teach. Because uhm...teaching prek kindergarten is not for me,
It's literal garbage. It doesn't even load for the sign in screen. Doesn't work on the computer either so pretty sure I just got scammed out of $45,
Paid for a year up front and cannot even open the app. Going to get refund for wasting my time. My child was very excited to play.,
"ABC mouse is amazing we got this app when we have been in lockdown so she can develop her skills whilst not in nursery our child loves it that much that she asks for it on her tablet. There is so much for the children to choose from, you have your own learning path and the children love at each activity the complete you get tickets where they can purchase a new pet or clothing for their avatars.It has spanish activities and books which we love aswell as our daughter is Learning spanish too.",
i need this app 2 be optimized 4 my daughters device. Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5. I purchased on my phone a Samsung galaxy note 9 but she needs 2 utilize this on her own device plz & thanx. hopefully this could b fixed within the 6mo. already purchased or I'll have 2 cancel my subscription regretfully,
This app is great for teaching children but doesn't seem like tablets where I needed it. The app would take a long time to load or would freeze up.,
I had a subscription for a while now. Cost me around $5 a month. This morning I woke to check my bank and find you have taken $50 from my account. Ive cancelled my account and will never go back. On the phone to the bank now to sort it out. Scam company!!,
If had this program since 2014 and I love it. I initially purchased it for my daughter when she was 2 and she uses it still and now my son uses it and he has advanced so much. Especially now with the Covid 19 pandemic I feel.like this is the closest to his regular pre school program.,
Amazing! New stuff all the time. A great way to begin and supplement home studies. I live the assessment tests.,
"My daughter is very happy with the ABC Mouse online program. After three months, all skill levels of her education have increased. Great product.",
We really like ABC Mouse. There are a lot of activities to do to keep children busy. I like the activities to advance the grade level. A+,
"Mother of 4 here. I got this app for my youngest child and he loves it, (4years old) we have had abc mouse for about a year and a half and it is wonderful for giving that little extra support, we have home work time (other children in HS MS and ES) so he feels involved in the homework process and loves it. Getting ready to look at the next step this company offers because my son is ready for it.",
"This app takes too long load, by the time it loads my son has no interest anymore. I have been paying for an App which we haven't been able to enjoy due to all this waiting game.",
I bought a year subscription and email address does not work and I contacted them they said I might have used a different email now I have to cancel them cause they can't fix the issue,
Really not very entertaining and engaging for kids over 4. Plus it is so slow to load that you can't even play the games. The free apps are a lot better.,
"this app wont let me login on my phone, ive been a member and i keep getting discount email but i cant login to save my lifeüòÆ‚Äçüí® fixe your buggy app guys i cant rotate it so i can see the login page and it appears desktop style on a mobile app, it truly is frustrating asf.",
ABCMouse has been a great learning tool for my daughter's homeschooling for 1st grade. It's a nice break from learning the old fashioned way and really keeps her engaged.,
I'ts been a great experience my baby girl started whe she was 18 mos and now she is 6 yrs old and almost done with the last lavel on ABC mouse 2nd grade level and she's starting first grade now in August she is more than ready for this school year thank you ABC mouse!!,
I was shocked to see hidden charges of 3.99 on top of monthly subscription. It is almost 20cad$ for a month. I don't see a value for this price.,
Good but keeps crashing. Love it for the kids and I think it does help. But it crashes soooo often.,
It's just like being in the classroom minus the kids. Thank you. And please continue giving encouraging awards for the kids progress.üòÉ,
"Literally just paid for it and it's not even working. I only had 20 bucks in my account and after immense consideration, I finally decided to pay for this so my son could learn and be happy, but I can't even get past the ""optional"" survey. I just wasted my money on an app that doesn't work...",
I keep asking for an email to be sent to change my password and the email is need sent. Tried several times. As I am paying for something we can't even use...,
I love this app it's just so easy to navigate and this is my third child to use it. I just sent my first off to college. Thanks ABC Mouse!,
I paid for a year for my grandchildren. I cannot log into this app! Ever! I have all the info to log in but it won't let me type in my ID & PW. I'd like to have something for my grandchildren to learn but this has been a huge waste of time and money. I tried to email and never got a response!,
Very disappointed just realized it makes the tablet I got specifically for abc mouse crash. as something special to do with my boy and I can't even use abc mouse on it. Is this something your even going to be able to fix?,
this app allows my daughter to continue learning even when i can't be available. i believe abc mouse has helped her to become an intrinsically motivated learner!,
"My grandson saw this on TV and wanted to get it. He says it's boring, so I'm going to cancel. But they are making me download an app for a product I am canceling, that makes no sense at all.",
I canceled more than 5 years ago and just got another annual renewal payment. Many bad reviews stating this as well with automatic renewal payment on canceled accounts.,
"Paid $50 for the year and it won't load. Even when it does load, you can't access any of the content offline. What a waste of money! Had it for little of two weeks and I want my money back!!",
My kids love the app but I am frustrated with it. I am unable to see their progress and have emailed customer support and tried calling and get no response.,
"Watch out. They will auto bill your subscription. Without warning, without an invoice or receipt, and wont refund you.",
Not interesting at a glance. Worst signup process. Not allow to login via App although seems to create account via web but not allow to move further. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé,
I literally just bought it and already I want my money back It's constantly freezing or not loading at all. I don't think this will be the app for my child to many errors,
"My son wasn't impressed at all. He was bored with the content and now that I want to cancel, they all the sudden have no record of my account, but they are taking my money every month. This was my experience. I am not satisfied.",
Terrible doesnt load and I cant cancel Edited 3/18: the app now loads and my child is able to use it. She enjoys the games and learning to count.,
"I cannot cancel my subscription, it's telling me no emai amount found. This is the only email I use. It's taking money out of my account üò°",
"Just purchased this and can't login! I was hesitant to purchase but since we have to do remote learning, I thought this app would b beneficial, not the case so far...",
With this pandemic and my child being pulled from school I hear these apps will be free to use for the time pulled. Still requires a credit card number. That I do not have.,
Stopped working. Last night the app and the website were both working great. Now this morning they are not!! Please fix these issues asap,
"Great Learning App, my Daughter loves playing ABC Mouse learning through play and collecting her tickets to dress up her little avtar and animals ‚ò∫Ô∏è... Hey there is there a problem with ABC mouse on via tablet.",
"This app is hard to navigate for an adult let alone a child. What a waste of time and money. Don't bother, but if you do...enjoy all the upsells.",
"while cancelling the subscription, in the workflow they had a button to upsell 3 months of subscription bundle which i clicked by mistake and suddenly without confirming they charged me 3 months of subscription price.",
"My son has used this app , for math , reading, learning and anything imaginable that can help kids learn. Wow! nowonder it has recieved many awards.",
Cant even try the game once without having to put in my debit card info. Supposed to be so good but you must pay to even see if its worth paying for. Zero stars,
"uses way too much space,and its not that great.. and like any other app/program , you better pay attention when renewing cause they just take your money from your card/bank.",
This learning app is amazing it is engaging and fun my 6 year old loves it and plays everyday for at least 30 minutes he is in Kindergarten and at the end of 3rd quarter he is reading at a level G which is 1st grade 3rd quarter benchmark!,
This is such a great app! So much for kids to do and learn. We started about 2 years ago. And due to the pandemic its been a great way to have school with my 2 and 4 year olds.,
"Its good it helped my son with speech delay talk more. And myoldest in Kinder helped him read. The govt (Clever program) is awful my friends recommended this app and its better than all those govt programs,",
They wont stopp charging me. I canceled months ago. Im not even able to log onto the account anymore because it says im not subscribed but im still getting charged monthly.,
I've had this app for years and its been wonderful for my children. i have 4 kids and 3 are special needs and they can get around with no problems.,
My daughter enjoyed playing it when I first downloaded it. It says you get a free month trial before it charges you and when I just checked my statement from downloading it yesterday they already charged me!!!! Where's the free trail!!,
"My 4year old Grandson loves this game and learns a lot from it. He loves the crafts, and the trips to the Statue of Liberty and the Golden gate bridge are two of his favorite videos",
App is slow as balls. All it does is test my child's patience... And mine. Way to expensive for a poorly built app. I'm getting my money back soon if this don't improve.,
Complete Joke and waste of money. And they make it very difficult to to cancel the subscription. Will never get this again or recommend to anyone.,
I download the app after paying 0.01 to them to start my free trial for a month but! Im getting charge for 9.95a month or 79.99 a year up front and i havent use the app for my free trial just yet.,
"My children thought this game meant less play time so, they hated it. I forced them to do it for a week thinking they would eventually enjoy it but, it only got worse. So I gave up on trying.",
"My child is too impatient with the APP. Kid's these days have no idea how to wait for something to load on a screen of any kind because we have given them too much instant gratification so we parents, aunts, uncles, etc. can get a few minutes of peace and quiet.... problem is that most people don't realize how bad it is for a young child to be instantly entertained by videos of all kinds... They are not learning how to be respectful and patient & they're learning horrible bad habits too.",
"Dont waste your money!! Really disappointed, payed for a year and over half the stuff on the app doesn't work and if it does it takes 15-20 mins to load",
"great material, but have had issues with some of the content not loading or saying we are offline, when we are not. Other than that my Kindergartener loves using it.",
"always has an issue, website doesn't help so you're stuck trying to navigate through the crappy app. not impressed with this program or the cost.",
Very slow nothing works. I unsucribed and it just charged me again and my kids havent been able to use it in months. Thanks to the COVID19 my hours at work have been cut i had $10 in my act i needed for gas money and woke up to a txt that my act was neg $55 because of ABC mosue and an over draft charge. I cancled this! why am i being charged? Now i have to re down load it on my phone and sign in to see what went wrong. üò°,
The app just doesn't work. Not on my phone not on my conputer/laptop the lag and time wait between screens and games just not being able to be played d not worth your time or money,
"Child centric, no pay to play and half decent learning songs for the kids . My son loves to learn with this app and I don't feel any guilt letting him explore the vast ABC mouse world .",
Signed up. Now the app doesn't open properly. Can't sign in or anything. I want my membership cancelled immediately.,

"This app used to work on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A but now it locks up every time I try to open it. After I un-installed, then re-installed the app it now locks up on the login screen.",
I'm using to delete it and reinstall it to get some of the apps to work. So fid what I'm paying for it is a BIG PAIN . BUT my grandson is learning so much from it,
"I signed my kids up years ago I canceled after the 1st year, because they didn't get on it enough to justify keeping it. I got charged last year and this year. Its pretty annoying that I have cancel every year and ask for a refund üôÑ",
"Paid for subscription online and can't log into the app. üòû Buggy user interface on the login page, can't even enter details.",
I can't even log in to the app because of a technical glitch that prevents me from seeing the login button. So frustrating.,
"My son loves this app. Sometimes he gets a little distracted but once he gets the hang of it , he's on the roll learning he's ABC and 123s. I love it myself.",
"Hello, I'm very upset at the fact the I signed for the 30 day trial. That same say I got notification that I had been charged from ABCmouse for a year subscription. I dont appreciate being mislead!! What if the program is not the right one for my 2 year old daughter. Will I be receiving my money back since I signed up for the 30 day trial?",
I downloaded this today and I got the free subscription downloaded this to my chromebook. It is glitchy and loads in the bottom of the screen and cant select anything.,
My son lost interest very shortly..also why do I have to download an app to cancel my service. Now you are just taking up space in my memory and using data to download.,
A horrible and terrible app. Paid $100 for the service only for the app to never work and atempt to charge me for another membership. Have tried and tried again and nothing. Just stole my money,
I hate the game because it was so bad that I couldn't stop shutting up on my tablet .the game was not going good . But it was just Keeping up the game in my first day I played mouse simulator and squirrel simulator and heroes wars dumb ways 2.,
Extremely slow and doesn't always work tends to freeze up or close out. For what I spent my money on I expected better.,
I bet the learning is good on this app bit I wouldn't know due to the beyond crappiness of the design and functionality of this app. This app is so bad that I want to get into web app design just to fix this.,
It was a great app it was just not what i was looking for in a learning app for my child that has Autism. Not 4 us thats all! great app good 4 others im sure!!!,
I bought the one year pass....and it doesn't even let me in. My daughter was so excited! But not no more. It's been loading for more then 30 min!!!! PLEASE FIX THIS,
"Love that it is all learning games, videos and books that my toddler has loved since he was 18 months old and goes through all of his developmental stages!!",
"I paid for a prescription, and it never works. Takes absolutely forever to load, and then Freezes. My daughter loves it, but it just never works properly.",
"I hated it before, but despite this Homer thing, I am taking back everything I said about this. I may be 13, but I support any learning programs that are having ripoffs, even if their Ads are annoying",
I can't login. The whole screen turns and no matter what I do it won't turn back or acknowledge that I'm pressing on login to input my information.,
My daughter absolutely loves ABC mouse. Every time she completes something she yells... I did it! Thats huge cause she has a speech delay.,
I love this app my children love this app as well it would be nice if you could do the assessments on your phone in sted of just on a desktop or tablet other then that we totally love it!,
"App would not install on Samsung Galaxy Tab A. It stopped installing at 72%. We are able to use ABCmouse in the web browser in desktop view on the Tab A. When tried in the web browser in mobile view, it stated the email address was invalid.",
Not a fan!! I've been trying to log in through app and it isn't allawing me. All I wanna do is cancel the membership and be done with it but I can't do that if I can't log in .... Poor,
"Spam and scams. That is all this site is used for. I have been trying to cancel and instead, have been told to download this and that and do this and still not cancelled.",
It's amazing but the tracker is no longer working and I rely on that to see how much my child has actually done because I'm usually off cleaning while he's on.,
His app is really bad. You cannot open it on the computer. Using the actual website isn‚Äôt an option which is sad.  Because of this I will stop my subscription,
"The app is not working at all. I will be cancelling my subscription. I need a way to cancel, I'm not paying for aomwthing that I can't use.",
They said you could unsubscribe at anytime. Tried several times. I live on a fixed income and was going to try this for my grand daughter. Now i cant unsubscribe and i am getting over draft charges. HELP!,
The app is not allowing me to log it...just a stretched screen on my Android. Annoying. I paid for a year n can't access it on the go,
"A great app. Good job to the developers. I suggest Abc,123, doh ray, me visits parts of Africa to learn more of the world than staying in the Americas and China.",
This game is helping me a lot and it just helping me I'm learning a lot 8 years old and in second grade actually wanting so much about this and I'm so happy this is a thing and that's why I love ABCmouse,
It may be cliche to say this but my daughter really has thrived since using ABC Mouse. She is 4 now and is more advanced than the kids in her daycare. üòÉ,
I just paid and i cant get it to work on my tablet. I cant get a full screeen view the app keeps freezing ive been working on this for over an hour and im beyond aggervated.,
"I availed their free trial for 1 month but they deducted P50 in my account. Also, my bank informed me that they tried to deduct 4x more. Because of this, my card has been blocked due to their suspicious transaction.",
Been charged endlessly and unable to use the stupid thing. Cant cancel. They have literally stolen. Steer TOTALLY CLEAR and dont become subject to theft. The app just doesnt blooming work,
My kids really loved the app but recently it just keeps sending me back to the log in screen I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still the same issue it's almost impossible to use now,
Wow talk about glitchy rough running app. Can't even login because it's so disjointed. Absolutely ridiculous. And I have the latest version I just installed it.,
I didn't tell her because this is so amazing and we'll have to try it out like my kids so much they cannot get off of it kids doing high school and Academy get off because it's the best in their life they loved so much,
"Got this one for my 3 years old daughter it's was good she doing great she had fun until it won't load when she wants to continue her lessons ,it keep crashing!!!",
"They literally removed every good component of this app. After over a year of membership, I am leaving. There is NOTHING good left. Don't bother.",
The learning path stopped working...having a hard time explaining to my 3 year old why she cant use it. Not happy specially since this is an expensive app.,
"I wanted to love abc mouse, and i do, when it works. It has been 5 days at least now i have tried to get on it for my daughter and it doesnt work. I think i will have to cancel, not bc i dont like it but bc i cant pay for something that doesnt work.",
Terrible app my kid sign up for it accidentally bc of auto fill..didnt know trying to get then to cancel the subscription..talk about hoop jumping never again abc mouse..i see you and your mouse scams. Of i could give zero stars i would,
Awesome learning app! Easy to navigate through and it helps my child gain extra knowledge to use along with his school lessons.,
Horrible customer service! Their customer service reps don't read what you say when you have a complaint and give you automated responses. Very frustrating to deal with. I just want my money back!,
Too slow on my phone. A 3 yo doesn't have the patience for it. A lot of things don't load. My daughter was upset because her avatar was bald because the hair options did load.,
The worst game in the world my children are now dying after playing this game I was advertised as a learning game but really it's just putting the mafia's interest in their brain killed my 20 children all of their friends and their Pre-K class this game was advertised as a good learning app but in reality it is just torturous and you know it my child that didn't die are now in the mafia,
When going through the signing up part and payment it goes pretty quickly. But trying to use the app it takes ages to load a page.,
very basic content ... It feels like a dumb app on a tablet Also shady business practices. I didn't realize they have been charging me without sending me a notification/reminder etc. I am done with you abc rats ...,
It seems free in the play store then after downloading you get 30 day free trial and by then your kids are liking it and then you have to buy the app some people can't afford to buy apps so we will have to choose another educational totally FREE app,
"I have had trouble using this on two different laptops, a phone and two tablets. App loads so slow it's unusable.",
It is really really not good because I try to sign in and it didn't let me sign in because it was so hard and I'm just a kid trying to get I don't know where my email address is I don't know what anything is so yeah I'm just going to go this your review and just never get this app you have to sign in so much stuff just get a ABCmouse app probably not even worth it and plus it's probably money for that I just never get this out please and also always be kind,
"You are offline I have installed and uninstalled several times. I have strong Wi-Fi but it is showing a message ""YOU ARE OFFLINE"". What is the solution",
"My kids enjoy playing and learning, while not realizing that they are learning alphabets, numbers, reading, writing and so much more, Thanks ABC Mouse developers, happy kids",
I've unsubscribed at least 3 times! And now they've charged me again when i didn't order it! I want a refund and an very tired of your company restarting my membership without my approval!,
The App is Extremely slow. I have to wait for few seconds each time I press something. This is annoying.,
It wont let me in the app. My daughter has not gotten a chance to use the app at all. I want to cancel my subscription and I cant cause I cant get into the app.,
Been using this for a couple days and now cant get the app to load up on my phone or my sons tablet. This is ridiculous will be canceling as soon as I can.,
Absolute trash.useless.doesnt let you cancel the subscription.freezes all devices .customer support is basically non existent. Waste of money.no stars at all!!!!,
"My son's preschool was given a code to redeem while they're on leave for the Coronavirus. I have the email that was sent directly from the school with the code but when I try to redeem I'm given the notice ""this code is not valid for this school district"". I'm sure I have the correct code. It's frustrating as it took forever for us to download and my son was so excited to try it out!",
"What a rip-off company with an evil product from a hyper-cynical company that puts every barrier to prevent you from communicating to them about problems. When you persist, they send you to a website called PISSED-OFF, which ties you up wasting more hours with still no resolution. Evil, sheer evil. Then when you are done they ask you more questions to suck you in again. They have many tricks to stall you. The'll even stick the screen to try to get you to cool down.",
Poor parental controls: I have yet to find a way to block portions of it I strongly disagree with. Nor have I found how to set screen time limits.,
Can't login as it's dictating every button I choose and I have to tap it 5 times to choose a letter and then if I make a mistake it freaks out. Why is it going that?!,
My children love using this app. They always look forward to getting on it and learning something new. I have already started to see the difference this app makes.,
"I paid the subscription but my son barely used it , so I deleted it. now I got a new year subscription charge without my permission I try to get my money back and they refuse to reimburse me. I do not recommended it",
I have canceled this a 100 times and they still charge you. Ended up having to cancel my card and getting a new one!! This place is a joke,
My 3 year old loves ABCmouse!! He's learned so much in the 2 weeks we've been using it. He asks everyday to go on ABC!,
Love this app for education. It does get frustrating with lag and long load time between activities.,
My granddaughter loves it's says her name and gets so excited about the tickets. She loves the different activities and she's only 2 always ready to press a new activity to see what happens.,
I just paid for a year subscription and an extra $29+ for the Adventure add on for up to 13 yr old. I can not find how to access the add on part for the older children,
What's the point of paying for a service when you have an app that constantly crashes after you've deleted and reinstalled it a thousand times? This makes no damn sense to me.,
Fun and entertaining for the kids. They learn so much and so quickly through this app and the lessons keep them engaged in the subject matter.,
"i cant even set up the profile .. evrything works fine till after you paid,, it keeps frezzenf or only shows a lil box.. i wanna cancel before it charges me for something that doesnt work",
App constantly just loads and nothing else. And your teaching toddlers abacus and astronaut with the letter a. How is a toddler supposed to Learn those words first and not the easy ones first?????,
I downloaded this app because I need to cancel my subscription but it won't open at all. It's stuck on the yellow screen! Why,
"This app is no longer working, it's taking very long to load anything. Please get it fixed. I paid for a year's subscription and the year is not yet up ..",
I do not know why it asked if there is ads. But I love abc mouse and my kids are super smart and now they do really good in school Thanks for making Abc mouse!‚ù§Ô∏è,
Is easy to learn much better because every time like my daughter just to get on it she still be like to be like your daughter is so good of math and reading and science and social studies and stuff and I'll be like oh my God you should get an A and she be like yes so y'all this is a good app for kids period üí®üí®,
It sucks because on this app in order to actually get in the app you gotta pay i mean yeah you get a 30 day Free trial but its only 30 days about 1 month but it sucks that you gotta pay to actually play the real game i give it one star. üôÅ,
This app took a payment I did not authorize. I can't even cancel subscription because it not showing up on my payment and subscription list. Smh,
"First got this for our granddaughters several years ago, and now being used by younger grandson. All love program, especially moving to new levels.",
"It really works I like when we get to play games and math,and other things update some more math and games cuz it's really good you should make it a ad and then I'm Mark this so good that it let me kick my heart out!!!!!!!!",
"It's okay, but it keeps freezing on my daughter. Pain in the ass to restart every 15 minutes. Also, I wouldn't really call it user friendly for children.",
Not downloading. Everytime I stop it and restart it it says its pending still been like this over an hr. Can't even get the game to help my kido with learning if it won't down load,
This is a comprehensive and detailed App full of interactive and educative activities. My children are having lots of fun while learning .This is a great innovation in the world of learning.,
"Got it for my four year old and he loves it, plus I had it linked through his school, so his teacher can keep track of his progress as well.",
This app was decent at 1st. Then it stopped working... everytime I tried to unsubscribe I couldn't get into the app to do it... I feel ripped off.,
"I love this app for my 2yr old. She is improving. At first, I was a bit sceptical if it would help her but it has. And I am grateful",
"when I try to download this app it downloads all the way and when it's done , it just says install like I didn't already try to install it 4 times now ! it's really frustrating . can someone explain???",
"Good app., but I had to cancel it. For 2 months now they continue to take the money out of my account. It's not showing I'm subscribed anymore so I don't know how to get them to stop.",
"Almost every time my kids want to play it,it won't load, we are paying for something that very rarely works, its very frustrating",
Sorry to say with the Abundance of NEGATIVE REVIEWS This App Has Generated We Won't Be Downloading It. You would think with all the money they have poured into the Advertising of this app they surely would make sure it worked better than it does.,
"Dont waste your time. Plenty of great kids app that are easy to use and FREE, unlike this one. And really 9.95 a month for a kids app?!",
"I am unable to download the app i tried clearing cache on google play, restarting google play app all together, restarted my phone everything i could possibly do and it still will not download!!",
Wonderful my 4 year old is reading small words. I like to know what level my child is at. This app helps me interact with my son on an intellectual level definatly worth it if you care about your child's education. Thank you ABC mouse!,
"""#3 top free"" according to Google play. But it's not free. You can't access a single game without paying a monthly fee.",
Don't fall for their free month offer. We didn't like it and canceled. We're still being charged and haven't heard back from customer service yet.,
"After installation and open app,blue screen displays and it never turns to other pagen hanged in blue screen,tried uninstalling n install still blue screen shows and hanged up in that page.i already tried since 1 week it's same",
"good app and my daughter loves it! however, it won't let me subscribe to the yearly price of 29.99 can someone help me please.",
This app helps my 8 year old child to learn alot she plays it every single day she loves her Avatar she loves the games this game helps her learn if she doesn't want to go to school ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è although the glitches are too much üòî,
ABCmouse is by far the best app for my children. They enjoy ABCmouse and the price is a steal! The app keeps my children occupied with age appropriate education! You won't regret a second of ABCmouse! Get started now!,
"After carefully reviewing a plethora of educational apps for my group, I determined that ABC Mouse, an ONLINE LEARNING ACADEMY, is a good ""match"" for our weekly learning activities.",
ABCmouse was better than I expected. The Learning Path is pretty convenient. I just wish I knew how to find sight words.,
Kids got bored with it. I didn't pick the option to auto renew. It renewed anyways. My checking account is now -59.99,
Very upset. My daughter has been trying to use this for days and the learning path still will not load. Very frustrated considering I paid for it.,
"In 3 weeks my son has learned to recognize the entire alphabet, recognize all the numbers 0-20 and fostered a huge love for reading! We love this app! Thank you abc mouse!",
"Does not load after logging in, just keeps flipping the load screen. Does it on all devices. Will have to call for refund.",
Got this app to let my nieces play on it. The app doesn't open. I've tried everyday since the app was installed. I just want to cancel the subscription. How can I go about doing so?,
Best program and app ever!!! My two year old is currently using the app on her tablet. She is learning so much and is already saying some words,
Took five times the money out of my account then got told they are a fraudulent giving wrong numbers and not contacting customers back still fighting to get my money back signed up for 79.99 yearly subscription they took three payments of 111.05 not happy,
Unfortunately I was just charged even though I cancelled my subscription and I'm pretty disappointed that there's limited contact information to resolve this issue.,
Good but block often in the game. Need to call/email support (4 times alteady) and that takes 24 hours so it s disruptive and break the effort of my kid. You said the device? So why others apps are all working fine and smooth? üòÇ,
It is great for kids all age I am 7 and I love it!!! But little little kids can't play it will be too hard for them.,
This app keeps freezing on my little one. possible that i am missing an update? Otherwise its a great help to my childs learning ladder.,
it tells all types of kids learning and helps kids who need help and are having trouble with doing things like math theycan just use this app......... You guys shou;d go ahead and buy this app now and try it.,
I want to cancel my order because the app is not working ond is totally frozen. I've tried several times to use it . Please cancel my order !!!,
"My kids, 5 and 7, love it! Lots of content, the app works well, keeps kids engaged. Kids earn tickets for completing activities which they can then make ""purchases"" with.",
great learning tool for children! they love it and ours went from failing to passing in a couple months after we got it.,
"They increased the cost and now make you pay for areas of the app they never used to. while they're increasing the cost they are deleting parts of the app like the Nano The robot series. it's gross when a company starts taking more money and doesnt use for good but instead starts decreasing production like a slum factory owner who laid off employees. I now use ""teach your monster to read app"". According to ur recent reviews I'm not the only one who noticed.",
"My 3 yr old son loves playing on this site! He adores all the different pets you can have, he dances to the songs, and more.",
I cancelled my subscription. They keep charging me. I deleted my card information. They keep putting it on file. Do not use this app.,
"This a great app, my daughter loves it. The fun activities keep her engaged and learning I even join in on the 2 player games and enjoy it myself.",
This app takes a very long time to load especially after taking your credit card info. Then says you're offline. Very annoyed üò°,
This app refused to let me register my child at any point ever after uninstalling it twice. Very disappointed and may have to cancel my subscription if not fixed asap,
This app will not open on my smartphone or Kindle fire! It lets me log in and then the screen starts flipping around nonstop! Sadly having to cancel my membership bc of this.,
Keeps charging me twice within days of the first monthly payment. My kids like the songs and videos.. I can find that on another app thay dont charge multiple times.,
"I love it, and so does my daughter! It has been very helpful with them being out of school, due to this covid-19. Worth $60 for sure!!!!!",
"I sure I cancelled and I was still charged twice, I will contact customer service and see if I can get those charges reversed as we never used it, it did not coincide with my daughters age, update it was taken care of, thanks for the response",
"I wanted to get my little 3 year old brother to learn a lot about ABC mouse, but turns out we had to pay for it. I wish thier was all free to play it",
Use to love this app for my daughter but it's not working it gets stuck at the loading screen. I'm assuming maybe to many users since all the schools are shut,
"So far so good, my 2 year old asks for ""ABC's mouse?"" Half the time I sit down so its keeping his attention on learning that's for sure.",
It was an excellent choice I've made. It has helped my son out on a higher level. He want to learn more and love to receive token.,
This app makes it so that my kids can get to the app store and setting. It takes for ever to start ABC mouse and any programs within. Don't waist your money.,
Absolutely horrible! I should have read the reviews first. If your app can't handle the increased traffic then stop taking people's money!! Even worse you stop responding to reviews and don't answer support emails. I want a refund!!!,
"Excellent app. Great for babies and school aged children. As an educator, parent, and grandparent; I highly recommend ABC Mouse!",
It's been a great app. My toddler is at a kindergarten level and enjoys learning. We're pleased and grateful for this resource.,
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE I THOUGHT IT WAS FREE. MY KIDS WERE PLAYING ON THER IPADS AND THEN THEY FOUND ABC MOUSE AND TOLD ME ABOUT THE GAME. AND THEY SAID THAT THAY THINK IT WAS FREE BUT WHEN T IT GOT INSTALLED IT SAID I NEEDED TO PAY TO PLAY IT AND THEN THEY STARTED CRYING SO BAD GAME DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME DO NOT INSTALL!!‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è,
"I love this app! My first daughter used it, now my second daughter is using it, and my son will be using it once his fingers are ready to tap, tap, tap!",
"I love this app. My son started on it and he loved it. it put him on a path of excellence. he is an ama,ing reader because of it.",
"this app is extremely slow! its hard enough to get my toddler to sit still, I can't keep her interested when we're constantly waiting for stuff to load.p",
this app is extremely dum if it's not free you never have created it in the first place not all of us people use credit cards it's really stupid to be paying for an app to teach your children how to learn at an early age.,
My child loves ABC mouse. She's excited to learn more than ever each day. I'm confident that she'll definitely be ready for kindergarten.,
My daughter loves the app and she loves the ticket method and she looks forward to her and mouse time! Also this app has helped her tremendously!!,
I am so happy my advice was listened to! I haven't logged on in a while but I am so happy there is now a progress tracker and a time limit setting!,
Ate all my cellphone DATA when I tried to download it so I didn't bother finishing download. Will also 'unsubscribe' due to bad reviews on here. Time waster.,
Great learning tool. Daughter found it a little boring. I've been trying to cancel my subscription for awhile and I'm still being charged.,
"Cant get to home page wont allow me to cancel seems I'm stuck on one page continuously, avoid this site ! Seems like a big con to be honest.",
"What a great program! My three grandchildren absolutely love this program. I enjoy watching them doing the lessons. Thank you, ABC Mouse!!!",
"I did a free trial an forgot to cancel it, and when I noticed all the charges I called to cancel and even though they admitted that I hadn't even use the service they still charge me.",
"Every time I try to reset my password it sends me to the website, which doesn't let me do ANYTHING BUT install the damn app I already have. Fix. This. Now",
Been paying for 6 months but cant even login..tried to log in to cancel the subscription...but it is frozen...nice scam...make me pay for something I cant even use...,
"The app glitches a lot, and they charge the annual charge without even asking if you want to renew your membership, not cool!",
My daughter is 5 1/2 and she loves all of the Learning games on ABC mouse. Thank you for providing us with a application that is for all ages.,
"I bought a year subscription for my stepson because it worked so well for my daughter back in 2010, however I have been unable to login in from my laptop, tablet, or phone.",
Let me rephrase this the email sent for the reset link does absolutely nothing. It takes you to the login and gives no options to reset anything.,
"Love that this keeps my 3 yr olds attention for longer than 5 mins, and the whole time he thinks he is just playing he's really learning!!",
By far the best learning tool I could choose for my kiddo. She has already learned so much and gets excited about doing it.,
"My three kiddos (K, 1, 2) are enthralled with progressing and earning tickets. Thanks for making parenting and learning fun and easier.",
It does help my Child Jana who is also an author (you can buy them on Amazon) it helps her with trigraphs,
The last few days the app has been glitching to the point it won't stay open. I paid for this app and now it won't work.,
We've loved ABC mouse for years but in the last couple of weeks the app has been crashing over and over and is impossible to use.,
Awfully laggy. I tested it out before giving it to my 5 year old and even I lost patience with it. Will probably not sign up after free trial.,
My kids and I absolutely love ABCmouse and I highly recommend it! Thank you ABCmouse for creating this fun and educational app for kids! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,
The login screen won't let me type in anything so I can't log in. I was offered a password reset link but that's no help because the box won't let me type anything into it.,
I pay for a subscription I downloaded install and I can't even get the game to load up or to even cancel my subscription so now they charge me for app that I can't even use..,
Keeps interest of my grandkids. They love the games and learn while playing. The immediate rewards of the tickets give them incentive to keep going.,
I am having trouble login in I have complain about getting a total refund they tell me it's okay to log back in but I have to re purchase. I payed for a full year I just want my money back and I can go buy my kids work books instead this is ridiculous,
This app keeps crashing. Then it freezes when you try to download it. Very frustrating,
Horrible. The application doesn't work . It is so frustrating and the worse is that you have to give your credit card before the free trial. I don't even know how to tell them that I don't want to pay for it because I can't use it.,
Is there a way to turn off the pet section? my kids will only do that and couldn't care less about the educational aspects. They've also figured out how to game the system yo just get a bunch of tickets to expand their hamster tunnel and buy outfits. Not what I purchased the app for.,
I like the concept but the app freezes and parts don't work at all (the stories in particular).,
Great idea to start your toddler learning new material every day to prepare them for the future. It is much easier for them once school begins.,
My 4 year old in pre-k loves ABC mouse... it's a great way to stimulate her mind right now till they're able to return back to school.,
"It stopped moving forward and stuck at one game on level 2, the problem has been going on days.",
Couldn't ask for a better learning app. My 4 year old grandson enjoys the puzzles and math problems the most.,
"It is very educational and fun for younger kids to do, I definitley recommend to other parents invest in abc mouse for your children.",
Horrible tried for 2 days to get to work . It pauses and keeps repeating the same lesson after child has completed the lesson.,
The app keeps perpetually loading and screen freezes. Very very disappointing for a paid app!!!,
very unhappy! my account was charged today 9.99 for abc mouse. I have not subscribed to this at all! no reason for it to charge me anything! I demand a refund!!!,
"This is a fantastic learning App, we love this and it has become a part of our homeschool learning which is fantastic. Works for my youngest and my oldest which is amazing.",
I just bought ABC MOUSE and I can't even open the App. it's telling me that it's not compatible on my tablet. not a good start to this product,
Awesome!! All three of my kids love this and ABC Mouse subscription is very affordable!! The app is free and convenient.,
"i just loaded the app for my grandson who is 2 & 1/2 and is non verbal and is on the low end of the Autism scale. So i am hoping that there is something in this app that will help him, I down loaded it on my laptop and it says its on a different device, And i want it on my laptop as he can touch the screen to answer the ???",
"LOVE ABC MOUSE, worth the money, great curriculum that keeps kids engaged, I'm rating 4 stars for the app because it is a bit slow and freezes from time to time.",
"I have three children in my home ages 2 to 6, and they all love and enjoy ABC mouse. It makes me feel good as a home schooling parent that my kids can play and still learn.",
My son was into it but the app. Keeps freezing n taking forever to load next activity that he lost intrested in it :/ not my internet all my other devices n app are working fine,
ABC mouse is amazing for my kids. They enjoy the puzzles and games and are learning at the same time.,
Love ABC mouse until the games started to freeze and it will tell him to try again but not allow him to play it ever again. Extermly upset with it.,
My daughter has learned so much from ABC mouse!! She loves the games and books and I don't have to worry about the ads.,
Won't let me log in. Screen stays blue but have this on another device & works fine. Confused on why it's not works on a Samsung Galaxy tablet e,
"The app itself is great, but it rarely works properly. They seem to have huge technical challenges.",
"If your child likes games, this will be the best tool for them to learn. It is very interactive and helps with every thing they teach in school.",
Great learning app! Even better customer service. I have and will continue to recommend this product to every parent with preschoolers.,
"The app is slow to load in a Note10+, ipad air 2 and web browser which makes it almost unusable.",
It distracts you from all your other devices and it's really fun and it's so easy to play and it's my favorite game ever out of all the games that I have free I think it's the best game ever and it has pets and some fish and some hamsters,
Very nice interface. Easy educational tool for ages 2 through grade 2. My son loves the puzzles and games on here.,
Won't work on my device. Not all my student can log on to the devices. Can't contact customer service via device.,
My 3 yr old is picking things up so much faster! And we only let her play an hour a day...if even that much!,
"My daughter is loving this app. It is her 1st introduction to technology and we were very hesitant to down this road, but it has encouraged her to want to learn which is great.",
Love this app. My daughter learns so much playing these games and has progressed greatly so far. She has so much fun learning with ABC Mouse,
Downloaded on my Vivo phone for the first time. When I opened it it shows a abc mouse logo then the screen filps and arrives at a blue screen. Please fix it.,
I have already paid in full my 1 year subscription but why i am charged of $3.95 per month. It's been 3 months since i am being charged.,
love this app help both my kids they play all the time going keep for it high recommend this app for all age my girls so much teacher them a lot cool stuff my girl light up when they place this. thank you for creating this app.,
"0*!!! I used this once, terrible, I cancelled the subscription only rubbish but even after removing it I've still been charged for! Dont waste your time or money.",
"My kids had fun on this app, but I KNOW I cancelled my account because my kids outgrew it (they're now 8 & 10) and I was still just charged $49 for another year! Super frustrating.",
"I loved it because none of my kids wanted to learn anything, the first time i showed them this app an they like it so much that Every day they ask me if they can get in the computer an get on abc mouse ‚ù§Ô∏è",
"Says you are able to cancel anytime, but they make it impossible to do so. Horrible customer service. Bank notified me that ABC MOUSE charged my account for $39.95 AND my husbands for $29.95 Haven't used in at least a year. Scam .",
"This app really has some great material for my 2yr old and 6 yr old, but it runs so slow and freezes up so much that my children lose interest.",
The online version is fine but the mobile app does not open.  I'm not able to log in. I have the latest Samsung Galaxy phone.,
App has never worked correctly on tablet or phone. I need to cancel my subscription but app won't work to do that.,
"Tickets for GLASSES? You know some kids NEED glasses. That's like charging them based on skin color, or gender. Kids can't help if they need glasses. The avatar is supposed to be them, why not allow them to have glasses free? Instead they have to use tickets they earn, basically like having glasses is a reward? Most kids would buy pet stuff before their own glasses. At least give parents an option to buy their avatar glasses with real money... otherwise great app and useful.",
THIEVES!! Still waiting on you to stop billing me for a terrible app I called and terminated edit 12 months ago. I followed link you sent me. Considering when we call we get put in call loopüôÑ. Hopefully you respond to it. We have filled a complaint with our bank,
Am from the Bahamas and i downloaded this app tonght i fulled out all information but when the app got installed and i open it it keeps telling me am off line which am not nothing is wrong with my internet i removed the app and installed it agin and got the same issue,
my 4 yr old plays on this app every day. from her learning path to her pets she loves this game. by far the best phonics ever. my 2 yr old even watches my 4 yr old play. very awesome! I'd rate a 10/10.,
"This is Cheryl's grandson Kaleb. I played this on Grandma's PC when I was younger. Now I'm revisiting it and I'm over the recommended age. I'm just a year over the recommended age, so what could go wrong? Edit : 1 1/2 years over the recommended age sorryüòë",
"UPDATE: I AM DONE WITH THIS APP; it is NOT worth the money, the frustration or the aggravation. . .it is slow, it freezes (EVERYDAY), it fades, it misplaces my childs path or I can't log on or out. . .it really, really (and I do mean REALLY) is a collossal disappiont. . .WILL NOT be reccommanding to friends and family, will tell EVERYONE I know to steer clear of this POC. . .",
Currently my app has been telling me I'm offline for the last two days. Pretty irritating because I am not off line and my son likes the videos. And this is not just on my phone but on his tablet as well.,
I have been trying to log in for couple of weeks now and the app doesn't let me. Will cancel my subscription as of today.,
app is constantly freezing up in the middle of an activity. I find myself unistalling this app everyday just for it to work properly.,
"Couldn't manage to get into the app, kept on asking for logins and other stuff. Not appropriate for a child to use.",
"won't load and says i'm off line when i'm not, won't open to a full page. uninstalled same day. whats the point if it won't load or open.",
"Amazing app, kids LOVE it, I LOVE it. They are learning so much but having too much fun to realize they are doing school!! üòÇ",
The only way to cancel my subscription is to download the app which Im unable to doüôÑ Update: still unable to download app or even access my acct online. I Will be disputing charges.,
Not working after multiple attempts!!,
I can not get log into the . That page keeps flipping from the side to full page. I can not get it to stop.,
The apps dont work on any of our devices only our home computer works on regular internet if you try to use the internet on tablets it makes you download app and app never loads past yellow screen,
This app is one of the only good ones i approve my son to use and it actually teaches him. But the app always crashes and its annoying.,
"Fantastic customer support! The app works great on my daughter's tablet, my phone and her chromebook. My 5 year old loves this curriculum. See loves to learn and she definitely approves!",
When my daughter was little she used to use it. What I think y'all should do is y'all should put ABC mouse and Adventure Academy together so then will be free. And they get to choose to make a Adventure Academy Kids her and ABC Mouse character so then they can do whatever.,
Couldnt finish the process of login the screen wouldnt load correctly it was small and all the way at the bottom of my computer i had to click the whole screen just to line up with the buttons,
My grandaughter loves this. It really motivates the kids to want to do more. Fun game but teaching as well. Win win!,
Hello I'm Lizzy and im a kid i am also in 3rd grade and im 8 years old and i recommend this app becuase this app is very fun to play on and it helps you learn a lot of new things. And I know that you will love this app. Just as much as i do this is meüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòªüòçüòçüòªüòçüòªüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòªüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç‚ù§üòç. That is me over this app abc mose! I love abc mose!,
"I love that my child is becoming a reader, with the follow along reading books! He is recognizing 3 & four letter words!!",
"I tried signing up for a 30 days free trial but my bank notified me of a declined debit order that tried going through, after that the app doesnt allow me access, it says i am offline, Please assist.",
The app is very slow. We have to wait for several minutes before the a lesson opens. Not enjoyable at all.,
I Ned yall to delete my account because I can't get on it so please stop billing me I haven't used it not even once thanks,
I purchased a subscription and when I downloaded the app the app does not work at all. I would give 0 starts but I dont have that option.,
No experience at all downloaded the app on a samsung galaxy s6 and Chroom book and the page does not come up but if i press escape it asks me if i want to log out funnily I have my payment info on there I want to just call it quits now I see the problems already. Get me some answers today cause this is some scam business if you think having ppl input info only for your app not to come up at all ... Worried about my payment info nothing more nothing less.........................................,
Do not purchase this app! Buyer remorse here. Wouldn't install on Epic issued Chromebook or Hp laptop. The playstore version on the Chromebook is too tiny for the screen..very little or no parent instructions..had to rely on browser..total pain..,
The app can't be downloaded on any of my smart phones. Fake app . Got me to uninstall most of my phone apps for it not to install. Beware.,
My son loves learning about animals and this has him very busy and learning new thing at the same time that he is playing on ABC Mouse.,
My son loves the app been on it almost everyday. I love it to makes him happy and smile so I hope alot of people get this app for the kids it helps alot and always fun.,
I downloaded this app for my daughter on a free trial basis. I can't figure out how to unsubscribe but it's been deleted from my phone for months and I just noticed they are taking 9.95 out more than once a month..seriously?!?!? I want my money back and I want out!!,
It literally freezes every single day!!! I have to keep uninstalling and installing every time they use it.,
have downloaded app multi times bc itkeeps messing up. already gave my payment info but we still r unable to use...will ot use in the future and will put a stop payment on this account senice I cant seem to cancle subsciption....just a waste,
"downloaded, put in payment info, and game hasn't worked since. will not launch, will not allow log in, will not let me cancel subscription. do not download! do not buy subscription!",
"My toddler has only been using for a couple of weeks, we are already seeing her recognizing letters. So exciting! And she loves it!",
Many games to play and are pretty self explanatory. Great learning tool for kids. Can be very handy for pre-kindergarten kids getting ready for school.,
"Okay, thank you for reply, is still a bit slow, but working better...kids now enjoy it cancell previous review(Re: Pathetically slow, and gets stuck... And you can't even log back into the account on their website to cancel subscription...)",
All it does is a TalkBack I can't even log in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. I suggest you either give me my money back or fix the issue,
"THIS IS THE WORST, please fix the site. I just purchased a subscription and the app is not working. I am so disappointed. I had to put a star because that the only way to post a review.",
DO NOT GET THIS APP unless you want to he paying for a subscription. The app claims to be free but when i actually opened the app i was told i had to sign up for a perscription.,
I can't not login. It keeps loading for 10 minutes. I exit and get back in several times and still the same. Waste of my time.,
"What exactly is the problem???? Why does this app NEVER work? And if you KNOW about all the issues, why do you keep allowing parents to sign up and giving you their credit card numbers? I'm contacting the better business bureau. You should not be selling a service that does not work. I am pissed.",
My 3 grandkids love this app. It's a valuable learning tool for kidsüòÅ ABC Mouse is not like any other educational app I've used so far! Best one ever!!!‚ù§Ô∏è,
Monthly price went from $9.95 to $12.99. Definitely was not expecting that. I feel as though it should be free but I was comfortable with paying $9.95 at least.,
"At first, I was disappointed in the service but seems like the dysfunction has been remedied and the application is fully operational on my daughter's tablet.",
"Teacher sent us a code and I logged in to use the app, but nothing is working. I even waited until they said the app should be fixed.",
Great tool to get the littles ready for school. Needs adult supervision in the beginning so the basic operation is understood. Well planned and looking forward to watching our grandson learn and grow!!!,
"Not like the ads, I purchased a year subscription and my daughter played like 2 times and didn't continue. She got bored really fast.",
"I love the program itself, but the app will NOT let me enter my email address, only my password so I cannot log in via the app.",
App is slow and won't open. Feel it might have been a waist of money. Let's hope your technical team has a response other then your automated response,
"I logged in, then every featurenmy daughter tried to use required me to enter the passqord again. After typing the password, i hit submit and nothing happened",
"Once again. The ""contact us"" will not load. Your response was either canned or plain foolish. We have been able to change all of the avatar's apparel except this sweater. This is a glitch that needs to be looked into.",
This program has everything my granddaughter needs to help her in 1st grade .everthing that they are working on in class she can come on here and get extra practice .,
My daughter really loves ABC mouse and wants to play all the time. She has learned a lot from ABC mouse as well.,
My granddaughter loves it once she gets into things. They have so many tools for the kids to utilize and different ways to learn.,
makes it very hard to log in. when you're doing trial month and seems to make as difficult as possible !! not happy at all right now !!!!!!,
my son didnt care to play but now will . my 4 year old girl LOVES it and has learned so much. she will be ready for kidergarten when the time comes,
I have a lot of friends that use this app. I have tried to get into it several times and it won't let me. It's already charged me $5 for the month. I really want to get my six-year-old daughter on it so I can start teaching her at home because she's being homeschooled,
Great learning. It is very fun and my kid enjoys it so much that she does not ask for tv anymore.I love it. It is very educational and fun,
I have had this app for at least 2 weeks and paid for it and the app hasnt worked a single time. very frustrating.,
"Is the app and website shut down or something? What's going on? I'm unable reset my password, and I'm getting an error message! Someone needs to fix this issue asap and refund me my money!",
Be careful because they will charge you a 1-year subscription when you try and sign up for a free trial I got charged $60 and the app is horrible and my kid won't play it for more than a couple minutes.,
my child enjoyed everything especially the assortments of books available in the library. We use it for bedtime stories too.,
"Honestly 2 Years Ago I Had this it was Really Cool but,a bit boring if you could please add some directions and a voice thingy because some of the Kids probably do not know how to Read yet!",
Lots of educational tools and activities for all age groups. If you can find a way to keep them motivated it kind of works. I think this is per child maybe.,
"I love ABC Mouse! App used to crash, but they fixed it. My kids love it! They love to learn and this makes it fun too!",
"Always buffering, tried on multiple devices never works right. And no phone number for help so eta to resolve issue is 3 to 5 days . Waste of money",
Because it takes long to load and my mom paid for this but apparently when it says u can have fun and learn at the same time I was not having that much fun cuz it has the same things except that on a holiday like on Halloween or Christmas and other stuff it decorates the game of what holiday it is. And my. Mom worked so hard a paid for it now I feel like my mom I tired cuz of the game now I'm madüòûüò£üò£üò°üò°üò°üò°üò§üò§üò§,
"*awesome* This game is awesome cuz, We get to learn! In 2012 when I was 3, I used and mouse! My dad being me to the library! People should LOVE it! And I'm 9 and I still use it!",
I rely love the app I payed for a hole year and then I should have had it till January2021 and now i can't get on with the new update. I payed a lot of money abc mouse and the Assessments. Now I am been ask to set up an account. Like rely.,
Ive been charged $9.95 for this app when I don't even have it. Don't have children in my home. I'm pissed to wake up at 4:30 am to a signal from my card that I'm being charged for something I don't have. Don't have a reason to have. I'm contacting my lawyer first thing Monday. Fyi 0 stars considering I don't have the app.,
How do i cancel membership? Myself and kids are unable to use app. It keeps loading for the longest while. And i am been billed for something that i am unable to use. So disappointing.,
I signed up or a free trial membership and was charged $19.75. I have been trying to contact via email as well as on the phone and no one has resolved my issue,
"My kids enjoy the activities. I am wondering if an activity is the same as a lesson in the learning path, or does one lesson include multiple activities? How many learning path activities my child would need to do each weekday to complete levels 9 and 10 in 9 months?",
It's a good app but my 4 year old just never really got into it. There wasn't any aspect of it that really drew her in or caught her attention.,
It takes forever to load & sometimes the games won't work on our tablet. Most of the content seems good & my kids do enjoy it,
"My kid was bored after five mins. The games should be more fun like their video games, and more challenging.",
Everything was great until the app just stopped working. I've deleted it and tried to redownload and now the app won't even download.,
"My son likes it a lot, very instructional but it requires parents support to toddlers navigate through games and activities.",
"not working. after fighting with it to sign in, its stuck on a tiny box that is completely unresponsive.",
lots of glitches and is always taking too long to load. I expect better quality for the cost....,
Good learning app. But they could put some more motor skills on there for preschool level. Also more books for preK,
Best learning app..so many activity for kids..but it should need little challenging for their age..sometimes it takes long time to load..,
"Paid for monthly service, the pages dont even load for my child. Considering cancelling membership and getting something else for my child to learn from.",
"We're really enjoying ABC mouse. It's a great price for the value of including my 2 year old in learning and for encouraging my K-6 reader while he's waiting for his turn on the laptop to do ""school online."" Thanks ABC Mouse.",
i see one and two stars wut is wrong with you this game is fun my daughter is happy with this game no glitches and no freezes it is the bestest game ever it helps her learn and stuff I'm never gonna delete it who made this game your awesome and the best,
"All kinds do is play the games and hamsters, not learning anything. There is no way to disable the distractions...",
Glitchy and very slow. It says its free for a month but then charges you a penny and demands you use a credit card even though it offers Paypal payments.,
"No difference then letting your child watch Dora or PBS. Not something I'll pay for, for another month. The app does all the work so the kid is just watching as if watching TV.",
Great learning experience. My 4 year absolutely loves using ABCmouse. He gets on it every day for a few hours.,
Poor performance on Kindle Fire 8 Kids Edition using Google Play and Amazon Appstore versions. Video stutters and pauses and displays buffering issues in video play despite being within 5 ft of my router and a confirmed speed test of 150Mbps,
Awful Paid for an entire year and can't log in! Tried Uninstaller and reinstalling cleared cache data everything and can't log in I've filed a dispute I wish I would have read reviews first. Waste of time,
My daughter has been using this since she was 3.5yrs old and she loves it! Its a great way for her to play educational games.,
Ive tried to cancel when I could not cancel I emailed customer service and was told to do what I already had. All I want is my subscription cancelled.,
Since the update my app is not working properly. I have deleted and reinstalled 3 times and it still is not working.,
I just downloaded the app for my 4yo and it doesn't work. Is loading for ages. After all of this you have to pay¬£9.99 per month. RIDICULOUS,
Absolutely wonderful app! Both my kids love it and they have learned soooo much on it because it's fun and keeps them engaged!,
My son is autistic and this is the first thing I've found helpful with his learning and education and the only way he focus on this for hours and I wasn't able to catch his attention before so thanks ABC mouse,
My daughter hated it and they keep charging me for the app TWO YEARS after we cancelled it. It isn't in my subscriptions on google play. Absolute rort.,
"My children LOVE ABCmouse! My 3rd grader has a hard time letting my Kindergartener play instead. Freezes sometimes, but no ads which is wonderful!",
Won't load. Been trying for an hour to get it to work....and it appears you have to login to cancel.,
Love this app‚ù§ My daughter loves it as well it makes her very happy and excited to learn. I saw a immediate spark as soon as she started using this app. 5 stars!,
"Not happy with this, downloaded and paid due to kids being home no school cause Corona virus and I can't get in, taking too long to load blank screens, been trying for 3 days now, want my money back!",
Big scam won't let you in the app to cancel something you didn't order in first place.they will cancel my subscription or I'll spend the 28 dollars to take them to small claims court.way too many people getting scammed,
My 3 year old son loves abc mouse! He has a set time each day to play. As a parent I also love abc mouse because it's very educational!,
"I would like for it to have a better Spanish option, it's annoying have to go and search for Spanish activities.",
"It was working well before. My son wen throughits pearning path and it is wtuck in one level, noway to report or skip it. And I dont know how to report it, message the through IG, no reply..",
"Far too over-priced for just the premiums due to continuing to work on the program and AS usual, they exploit the children",
"The app jams on the pop and peek levels. You have to go to a desktop to get around that. If it weren't for that, this would be 5 stars",
It's really good app. My sister was very bad at maths and answering questions from readings. And now she loves this app and she is getting better and better :),
"Love it but.. it freezes after every lesson and I have to reload after every one. New user too, disappointing because we otherwise enjoy it.",
Very good app for children. My only complaint is it is so slow to load. You spend more time Waiting on it to load than playing the gane,
"I want to download this app so bad for my toddler but reading all the negative reviews is really a let down, and this type of reviews have been going on for more than a year and I see they still haven't fixed it. Not downloading this app untill all this gets fixed.",
I have created a account 3 times and entered in my payment information. It is still not recognizing my email. Very frustrating,
"This app is Soo slow to load , by the time it load I no longer want to use it . It's too frustrating I just deleted. I have a question if I delete the app am I unsubscribe, or what exactly do I need to do to unsubscribe? Because I don't plan on paying for something I am not using.",
My daughter is 4 years old and enkoys abc mouse so much. She wasnts to be on it everyday!! She is home schooled with ABC mouse. I also can print out work that she can work on with her hands.,
This has been the best app I have found to help my kids. They have been able to learn and catch up on anything they were behind on. I recommend this app to any parent with a child.,
The app will open and as it loads the loading screen job from side to side and on the computer it won't go to the login screen it goes straight to the registration screen and it won't let you do anything else,
"Had this app on my android tablet, but it somehow (probably the 4 year old) got uninstalled. Now it will not reinstall from play store.",
"Kids love ABC mouse so much. They learn so many things. There is math, reading, science, games and so much more!",
My grandson loves this app. Thank you ABC mouse. He had a learning disabilities and thanks to ABC mouse he is back on the right path with his reading. Once a gun thank you ABC mouse.,
My kids who were already doing great love it. Kids who are not show no intrest. Also only gives option to add up to 3 children.,
"The app is not working at all says offline when I'm not because I'm writing this and it wont let me sign in online says its blocked, only just started it and put bank details in etc and it's still not working.",
It keeps freezing up and I have to go to my settings and force stop it and restart my phone. Can someone please fix this,
Baby Jesse Loves The App!! She is a 2 and 1/2 year toddler and now knows primary colors and shapes. Only played the app for less than a month,
"You cant even get it FREE. its very disappointing, what if you want to pay?! That a lot of fricken poop. Geezers. Its a rip off of course. I don't think it's a good idea to have people spend their hard worked money on nothing. If i could do a zero star i would. Hate it. Thanks for doing nothing.YOU BUTTER FIX THAT FOR PARENTS!!!!!

So far it has been a fun and educational for all three of our children. The only reason i am giving it 3 stars is cause i wish our children could still enjoy it when there is no internet around us.,
For the last 6 months it's been taking 9.95 plus 3.99 of my account I cancelled over 6 months ago n it keeps repeating taking money off my card I don't use this app nor do I have this app so please some resolve this issue IMMEDIATELY thanks,
"absolutely love this app, my daughter is finding it easy to navigate and loves spending time on all the different activities",
"Terrible, It gets frozen after login and doesn't work on either tablet, mobile or even web, I can't even get access to a cancelation screen",
Supposedly all problems were fixed on the 17th. But it's the 19th and still can't get passed the splash screen,
Is there I just put in a couple of new words and vowels into the book that I created and I like to see the children be able to use it or adults to be able to use it to have fun and spare time.,
"Awesome learning experience, NO ads, BUT I wish there was levels for your kids so then they could like level up to get harder stuff",
"Very educational, our son loves to play the games and helps him move along on the education system faster than his peers.",
"My son used the website, and loved it. Because we don't have internet, he didn't use it much. We used the free trial, but didn't/don't have the extra money to pay the monthly payment.",
"Such a good experience, she now wants to learn on ABC mouse then be on youtube. My 7 month old even is starting to learn.",
It's a very nice way to be able to give my daughter a smart devices knowing she's going to be doing something smart other then watching youtube videos or nonsense,
I can't even download it at this point. It gets stuck at 70% on my ASUS tablet. Downloaded this on an older IPad with no problems,
log in isn't working,
"My 2 year old loves her ""school time"" we go at her pace on the learning path and she enjoys exploring the rest of the app also.",
Horrible I have been trying to cancel since before the free access even started still being billed monthly. Please cancel we have never used this app. Peggy Hughes,
we love this app but it take a long time to load and my 4 year old can't read good yet so i have to explain it to him and the point of this app is to help ur child learn,
Take too big memory space but its worth it with the content they have. U may need a good ipad to make it function properly.,
I just discovered the apps that ABC Mouse offer free with membership. I am going to try ABC Mouse again and discover the reading writing and math apps and review later.‚ô°,
having problems using the app ever since the mosr recent update. it keeps kicking us out when my son tries to finish his learning path on our tablet.,
I canceled my subscription in 1/ 22 and they are still billing me. Not happy at all. Can't seem to get to them for information.,
"Worst experience I have had with an app. I understand the amount of usage but with the money they are making off people, they should be able to hire people that can do whatever to keep up with the usage.",
Love this to spend quality time with my niece she's 3 and absorbs everything like a sponge.. I do wish that she could learn sign language on it..üòç,
Game won't load on tablet. I've updated app. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It still will not load.,
Horrible! I'm on day 2 and now it won't load anything! Won't even load the contact us page! Waste of time and money.,
Great learning tool but due to high volumes i cant dowbload it onto something my child can use and it is such a pain in the butt to have to make him use my phone when i need it for work.,
Not so great. I have been trying to download the app going on a month now. It starts to download then stops at 72 percent.,
good app fpr learning. would not take billing info so just deleted from phone. will find another app to help my 6 and 10 year old to learn more.,
Started a trial for my son but cant download the app. I have tried everything from clearing cache and data to restarting and downloading it again. Help please,
Kids are learning alot thank you!,
Will not load. Paid for 6 months up front. Can't even see what the app holds bc it will not let it go past log in screen!,
The signing up is so hard that I'm trying to see where am I'm signing up and it's asking for my email and password but it's not working. For my child,
We cannot connect to the app we uninstalled then try to reinstall message comes up can't at this time app is paid up to date but can't use frustrating,
abc mouse is awesome. the only thing Is it is for ages 2-8 I hope soon abc mouse will be for ages 2-12 or 2-11 but overall it is the best app ever.,
"Great program, makes learning fun! I purchased this app for my two grandchildren, ages 2 and 3. Well worth the price!",
I'm loving the activities and the excitement that my son is getting from this app with the way things are going for school I feel 100% more confident in our homeschooling thank you for creating this!,
My kids love it!! Homeschool is so much easier with the help of ABC mouse. Also Adventure Academy is great for home middle schoolers as well!!!,
So slow when I tried to redownload again it was so slow I try to cancel it wouldn't let me and keeps on charging me. Do not recomend.,
My credit card with charged without permission if you have a trial. Your credit card is not supposed to be charged until the end of the trial.,
Abc mouse was not useful for my three year old or even my 2 year old I think that this app is wasteful time etc. Please upgrade this app so I will be able to use this in the future thank you as a mom of two,
This is so frustrating the app keeps lagging and children keep losing focus Update: This app is definitely better now and my kids enjoy their learning experience,
Fantastic! Used it on a long plane trip with a two-and-a-half-year-old and it saved us! The content is really fantastic! She loves it!,
I love it. I been using it since my oldest was 4 years old and he 10 now. I have all my children using ABC mouse and they love it,
"I can't even get the app to load, it just sits there then give an error message. What is going on? ABCmouse...fix this so our kids can learn!",
I haven't use it because it froze and I paid the 30$ subscription I ready uninstalled it and installed and it sends me back to the same blue screen,
Pretty crappy that my FREE trial isn't even Free!!! They charged me 9.95 as soon as I signed up and them I went ahead and did the year plan and they charged they right after the 9.95 WTH?!?!!!! My child hasn't even played it yet and I already want my money back just because you did that!!!!,
"The learning path gets boring super fast. There isnt a G&T path, and they will take your money till you are pulling your hair out. Fought with them and my credit card conpany for 2 hours to get it straightened out.",
I seen too many ads of it on my talking Tom 2 and other of my outfit7 games I have some times it's annoying to me always trying to make me install and I refuse but I like it,
My child who is 5 absolutely loves it,
I am trying to use this app but it is only saying members log in but I'm not an member and it won't give me the opportunity to sine in as someone new to this app,
The little one plays it almost all the time. The learning path is her absolute favorite.,
Clunky and slow. Spent so much time loading that my child would get bored and not want to play anymore which just caused issues.,
Sometimes hard to find where to go,
I just made my account and the app isn't allowing me to sign in. It keeps saying my email or password is incorrect but I can sign into the site,
"No clue who to even talk to about this but I was charged twice today for my subscription, so I'm pretty mad. I'll be finding another similar service.",
Very slow. Doesn't connect very well. Doesn't save changes.,
"Well,when I was in kindergarten I was smart. But they made us play it and it was just boring and didnt help.The people in the commercials are prabably just acting.",
son gets to lesson 1 level 67 and its stuck there. it will let you move the kids but it will not play the activity. it's been stuck for 3days and my son will loved doing it everyday,
Horrible. We deleted this app a year ago and got charge again for a whole another year today after already canceling this app a long time ago. I would like our money back please!,
This app is terrible and it won't let me cancel my subscription! I've written to them and everything but keep getting billed,
I love it it's help my kid learning,
"My daughter is 5, she has downs...she has learned so much, she says more words, counts better, and shes learning her primary colors",
"1st thing.. after install is to set up account then 30 days free. So when I test it & decide it's not worth it, I then have to monitor my account to ensure your not charging for something uninstalled after 30 min. No thanks.",
I love it! We are going on our 2nd year using it. My daughter has learned so much & loves playing it.,
Cannot even install the app after paying for a subscription. Just trying to help my preschooler learn during all this and cannot get what i paid for.,
We loved this app now all of a sudden we can't log in. The screen is messed up and will not allow my little one to log in.. disappointed,
"The screen stays yellow and the app won't open. I updated it, no change.",
"It is a GREAT program for kids, but 70% of the time I log in to practice with my kid there is a technical problem with it. It's annoying.",
"I was subbed to this rats nest via a scam website and haven't been able to log in at all yet alone to cancel until recently this company took me for nearly 200$, go spend your money elsewhere these people don't deserve it.",
Doesn't open beyond the yellow screen with the mouse. Newly-downloaded. Useless.,
I only installed this app again to let you know I did not subscribe to this and gave no one permission to withdraw funds from my account. I will be disputing this charge.,
this app is incredibly slow. wait time is almost 5 minutes to load. my 3 year old just politely slides on over to kids YouTube. fix this if you still want me as a customer,
"I'm giving this app one star, but it really doesn't deserve that. I paid for the membership and I can't even log in and do anything. I've been trying for an hour and at this point I'm fed up and annoyed.",
"Wonderful app for my child, already in the first week he recognizes numbers 1-10 and all the letters of the alphabet. Money well spent!",
I bought a years subscription a few months ago my kids have only been able to get on there a few times locks up most of the time on one page won't let him switch people and speaks really quickly at the beginning of the sign in like gibberish I'm mad I wasted the money,
"Really wanting to cancel and cant do anything until i download the app üôÑ def gonna waste your time with this! Very slow, kids get frustrated with it too",
Since the latest update. I can not sign in. It wont let me put in the email address but will accept the password with no issue.,
Not free.. needs to be removed from free. free means free. frustrating.. download this big app just to find out you have to sign up and pay after stupid demo.,
I would have subscribed to this software if it was clear that when downloading you aren't getting a game. This is shady business practice. From one developer to another it's quite sad to see this type of business model on a kids game. Big time shame.,
"Don't let your kid talk you into this, five minutes of your time is worth a week of this. It's a scam that locks you into payments, and then charges you months after cancellation. More effort spent on trapping your payments and not worthwhile learning experiences.",
"This app isn't supported on the new tablet we bought for Christmas, a 11galileo pro. Very disappointed, something so popular should be more widely supported",
This is a great learning tool for kids awesome definitely recommended my sons will sit on here and play learning games for hours they learn how to take care of different pets an infinite amount of options,
"It not letting log in at all , I just signed up for it today thought I'd be great for my kids because school has been cancelled but I don't understand what's going on , how do I stop them after the 30 days for charging my account",
I just paid for a subscription and now the app didn't work on my daughter's tablet. Thusnisna crappy experience because her school is closed indefinitely and we need to continue her education. Fix this today or give me my damned refund!,
I cancelled the almost $10 a month subscription 2 months ago. Deleted the app and later found that I've been charged twice.,
My daughter was behind in speech development. Since starting ABC mouse she is progressing so quickly we are truly amazed.,
You have to subscribe or join something before you can use the app. Not worth the download when looking for an app you can read to your child/children.,
I would have given it 5 star. Its all good except I wish there were lines in each letters and numbers like the cursive letters.,
Parent section of app isn't working right. When I go to access it i click.on setting or any link there and nothing happens.,
My son is on pre-school lvl 2 and the game Market letter line R-Z is glitchy. He can't advance because the Z is missing. The update didn't fix this. Please help.,
My kid love this app very much it was so helpful during this lockdown time it's very innovative educational kids would definitely love this app no worry about using iPad anymore ‚ò∫....,
I can not put it on any of my devices and i cannot cancel the 10 dollar a month charge due to no compatible devices.,
Have attempted to use this app for 3 yrs . tho we live in a rural area . i have been Very Disappointed with the very poor service,
I hate signing in can you just make it your email and password not the code for your card and stuff I hate that can you please that would be good and then it would be okay I will give it five stars if you do that I do like it I just wish that you didn't use the code for your card it is great for my child but it's not great for the card thingy,
"During this quarantine it makes schooling my little one easy and fun, and there isnt much if a fight about getting her ti keep brushed uo on school work.",
needs to have easier controls for a 3 year old. other than that so far she loves it.,
"The app was ok but I have asked yall to please unsubscribe and stop pulling the money out of my account for over the last six months. I have email support numerous times. Out of respect this should have already be taken care of. So I did not have to say anything ugly about this app. Some of us do not have much money as it is, but we try to help further our childrens education. Then when it isnt benefiting them anymore and ask to stop you still proceed drain there account. What are you teaching ?",
This app is acting up when I sign in my email it doesn't go through so I would not like this game anymore I deleted it and it came back on my phone I was horrified!!!!ü•∫,
After the recent update it no longer will load on my child's tablet. It stays on the loading screen and drains battery.,
has been VERY glitchy lately. great concept but so many problems loading and glitchy games it deters use.,
All three of my children play ABCmouse and absolutely love it. They love creating their character and doing their Pals as well as playing with their pets.,
I've been trying to install it many times. It's says it's downloading then disappears when downloading is finished.,
Not satisfied. App does not work most of the time. App up to date. Plan to cancel soon.,
"Subscription through app only and not via Google subscriptions (how is this allowed?). Wanted to like, buggy and expensive.",
Login email phone card and all info. Before u can try it. Absolute horrible. And u have to agree to receive all kind of EMAILS.,
Paid for full year. Have receipt but it keeps asking me to pay and cannot use the app.. such kame! want my money back!!!,
My kid loves this app but very annoying when it messes up alot takes forever to load really not worth paying for when you have so many bugs..,
"I tried it but then it lagged and uninstalled itself and all my other games. Its good but this is just stupid. #CREEPY . I loved it when l was 4 or 5, but now im 9. So please fix it. Thanks.",
My daughter is actually interested in learning now. She wakes up and immediately wants to get on ABC mouse.,
My grandson and I both love ABC Mouse I believe it is the most educational app. available to date and I also love that you can keep up on the progress you child is making,
"It's great when it works. Half the time i just get a yellow screen on tablets, computers, and phones.",
I have this app on my daughter's new Kindle Fire and for the learning path it keeps stalling out and not letting her progress to the books so if that is very frustrating,
Good education content but the slow load time and glitchy-ness makes it to hard to use. Wouldn't not recommend,
The best learning app. So happy i decided to get this app for my twins. They're both above average in their kindergarten class.,
After this recent update the app has completely stopped working for us. Now we are paying for an app that doesn't work!,
Having a hard time going back to the beginning of the learning path lessons. Is not ready for level 1 yet.,
This app is amzing and I love being able too set with my two family members and play and watch them learn. All in one place.,
"Unable to access anything. When I first signed up and up to last month I had no problem, but today, NOTHING!!!!!",
Its fun and keeps my 4 year olds attention. I can tell she is learning and getting excited about it too!,
conveniently the app wont let you cancel an account. neither will the website. and the hotline doesnt work. this program funds the cult of scientology. beware!!,
absolute scam. got me to sign up and I can not download app needed and can not cancel.without app! scammers if anyone can help cancel my account I will withdraw this review,
It never has worked right for me. I login and it keeps sending me to the login page. I'm canceling and uninstalling this app.,
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èWhen I first downloaded the app it was wonderful and fun but after a while it started to Take so long for the page to load..my kids have to wait 30 seconds to a minute for something to load ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è,
I couldn't even download app even though I had alot of memory but it still wanted me to delete some apps. App doesn't work at all,
I downloaded for my daughter. I cancelled before the 30 days was up. I still got charged for it. I'd like a refund.not happy with this,
"It was ok i suppose but my 3 year old had little to no interest in it after 20 minutes he never wanted to play it again. Id say ""Hey buddy wanna play ABC Mouse?"" hed say ""No no no ABC Mouse"".",
My grandson absolutely love love loved it Im thinking of doing k-12 for him next and I highly recommend it to everybody else on the planet keep up the wonderful work we desparately need programs like yours in every country right now and thank you for this wonderful experience,
The monthly subscription is too much so maybe lower it to $20 C99.Its how you get money but expensive.I get my salary once every too months and have 3 children to use this so my wifi bill also goes up.Please lower it to atleast 10 dollars up what I said. -Stephanie Lanza(Using my daughters account),
"Hate this game! While I went to download this app on my IPad, It said I had to do an account, and I tried to do that, it didn't work! Profile was locked, of course! Please fix that! But anyway, DO NOT download THIS APP for kids!",
Really love this app for my kids I feel it helped my son alot before he was put in school I want him to have every possible chance he can as well as my other kids,
Awful. Impossible to contact customer services. Trying to cancel account and they have made it as hard as possible,
It a great learning app. I'm starting Mary Jane on her homeschooling Monday because things didn't work out with baylink and brick and mortar so I'm downloading this app again because it is a great app,
App doesn't work right on a kindle. Its slow and freezes up. My 3yo didn't like abc mouse at all.,
With the schools shutting down this has really helped me as a parent feel like I'm giving my child something good and educational.,
My child could not use this app and i cancelled it and i got billed for it anyway. Now i have no way of getting my money back nor shutting off a $12.99 charge a month for an app my child never used.,
It's really sad because strait away u have to do a 30 days trial and then start paying so useless I swear I suggest don't download it in less u are ready to pay and if not that delete!üòë,
DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! I tried to cancel my account and its not letting me go to the home screen. its charging me 9.95 a month and its not giving me the option to cancel.,
It is the best.My 11 kids love it.I am a single mother and I do not regret installing the app.It teaches every thing my kids need to know for school.I totally do not regret spending my mony.It's the best.,
Horrible app...first off the website doesn't let you do anything on it and secondly the app wont let me install it so i can cancel my subscription.,
Love this! My grandkids are learning so much...and they are having fun while learning. Awesome product!!! AAA+++,
My 3 yr old son loves ABC Mouse! The hamster and cat make it so he wants to learn because he wants to build a cool home for the mouse! Thank you!,
"I just wanted to download a game for my kid. Instead I need to fill out some form, create a password and leave my email. Oh, and they also want you to pay for it.",
I love this app so i decided to download it again but it seems to not be working at all it just keeps loading the page but nothing shows up,
Terrible apps so far doesn't work and will not load thank God it was only a $1 waste of money and time very disappointed in a company claiming to be one the best I dont reccomend at all guys.,
The videos arent being played on my daughter's tablet. It buffers and at the end I am hearing that she played that path 5 times today.... Can this be sorted out please,
ABCmouse is a great source of education for young children. We have been using it for 2 months and am totally pleased with it.,
"Our 3 kids (preK, K, and 2nd) Love this and it is a great tool to help them before school or during breaks to work on stuff they struggle with.",
We absolutely love the improvement in our toddlers ability to learn and grow in independence!!,
This can't be worth $10 a month because it just shows has black screen and you can't do anything don't fix it I just uninstalled it,
Unable to login from Android,
"My daughter 3-year-old loves this. She loves the songs, the puzzles, the activities and the the virtual books. She enjoys it!",
My son loves ABC Mouse more than any of the other apps he has done. I'm so greatful he likes it so much!!!!,
daughter loves it! she is 3 and thinks it is just games but I can tell she is already learning from the fun activities,
"Bought for a coworker's son, I can no longer afford it, as I am no longer employed, But it's been a joy seeing his progress. It's a very good program for kids.",
It will not work on my laptop google chrome? not full screen and i can barely see the small window it gives me cuts half of the picture?! Ive tried to make it big window but wont let me???,
The material is great but there are some glitches that need to be worked out. Some of the activities lag or kick you out.,
"not free. paid monthly subscription only, i flagged it. it should be removed from free section please mark this comment as helpful to raise awareness and flag this app as inappropriate like I did so they can remove it from the free section thank you",
Have had this app for a total of 5 mins. Paid for the services and it's not working... I guess I just wasted my money and I should have listened to the others about this app being a joke!,
I cant give it a rating because i never tried it i thought it was free...there are other apps just as good thats free for my child to learn and have fun doing it...too bad,
I love the app and my son has fun but after the last update. the pages don't load and it freezes ALOT.,
Worst app.. Cheating .. I have signed for free trial.. I am not able open my app during free trial ..we forget on the app..now they charged $9 ..i want my money back,
My kids love it but wish there was new content added and that the learning path wasnt so scattered on what you learn one minute its teaching you things that srart with the letter a then it moves to the letter g ect,
I'm sure this is a good ap but I got a new phone and now all I get is a yellow screen so now I'm paying for an app my don can't use. But I must say it worked great until the new 5g phone,
Hi sorry i used to love this game for my daughter she used to play it! We cancelled it afterwards. But they send bills to pay more taking out the money from his pocket,
I am not able to log in for some reason. The app does not give me the opportunity to enter my email to log in. I HAVE A MEMBERSHIP BUT KEEPS SAYSING THAT IT IS FOR MEMBERS ONLY,
"For whatever reason when my child has used up all his time for the day it won't accept my password inside the app to increase screen time, but will accept the exact same password when I open the app in a browser.",
LAGS HORRIBLY. Some pages don't even load. Haven't been able to use the app for months.,
Not Good with Chromebook. It only shows half the screen and doesn't let you click on anything.,
App is garbage. You will be lucky to get past the load screen. Same on all devices. Jut awful.,
I would really appreciate if y'all would stop taking money off my debit card. Because I don't use the app anymore. I haven't use it in 3 months. Thank you,
best experience for my kids that are bearly entering school. thank you for this fabulous program. for this kids.,
"This app is keeping my son busy during the Covid crisis and he's enjoying the learning games, so it's a win-win.",
"I cant get the app to start. The app is like its in minimized format, and there is no way to use it.",
"Hasn't loaded in months even after updates. When we first got it it worked great, but we haven't been able to use it for a long time.",
I have an ongoing subscription and this is first time I downloaded app to phone. It will not bring up typing bar to sign in.üòû,
I love it so much that i feel like i should play it every day. No one helps me! Its so my mom even changed my grade to 2nd grade! This is the best day ever! :Mariam:,
"Great educational app. We used this when I taught kindergarten...kids loved it! My 2yr old grandson loves it, too!",
"awesome app my child Syndy has a great experience with this app and is the top kid in her class thank you so much she comes in and comes staight to my chome book instead of being on her ipad thanks so oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much age of learnig, ink. Also, Selena Gonzalez your crazy the app isn't feezing your connection is bad so dont blame the app dodo brain",
I've used ABC Mouse as a parent and teacher for 8 years. The offline content apps are amazing additions for on the go learning.,
The reason I am giving it a 3 star rating because I am in second grade and it is so easy because my dad put me on level 10 and it is still easy I do not know why but it is k I like the game tho it is really fun I play it every morning,
"Signed up for the free trial, cancelled before it was up, and was still charged. NOT HAPPY!",
SCAM! They got away with charging me for months after I was curious enough to check them out. It took me a long time to cancel with them also. Beware!,
Amazing app!! He has learned so much! Even knows some Spanish and its only been 5 months! Thank u to everyone at ABC mouse!,
"Don't waste your money on this , it never loads and is a rip off. You'll get charged over and over . You can't get a hold of anyone to help and stop them from taking your money out of bank ... beware !!! Total rip-off (I hate giving this even one star )",
Great content but the app glitches constantly. If the program didn't cost as much I wouldn't mind but this app is too expensive to work this poorly.,
abc mouse will not let me cancel my subscription for nothing i've tried everyway to cancel and they are still taking money out my account. Pissed,
u have to pay for this app I hate to pay for just a game too expensive but a really good tool for young kids I liked it but it was too expensive so I stopped paying for this game sorry üôÑüôÑüôÑ,
This game was so beautiful. It made me so happy to see such a fun amazing game on the app store. Would recommend for kids 37-42,
"Slooooooooow. The app is terrible, it takes forever for activities to load. Do not waste your time or money.",
I can never get it to load. I even just put it on a new tablet with nothing else and it still won't load. I'm going to be cancelling my membership.,
Keeps crashing on my phone,
Very sloooowwww not easy for kid to navigate through. Also signed me out and tells me I have no subscription but still charging me.,
Omg I luv it so good for my 9 yr old daughter she was having some problems with math so I thought this could help her and it did that is why I rated this 5 stars.üòÅüòÅüòÅüòçüòçüòä,
Really a kind help for childs to achieve a strong foundation for academic education and also for their professional life. üëå Excellent,
They will continue to charge you for months after you cancel. Customer service is a joke. After I posted on my personal social media about my frustration with customer service. I've had over 10 people tell me they experienced the same. Over $100 worth of charges,
App sucks flips from landscape to portrait mode back and forth that's all it does.,
This app is very educational. My four year old loves it and really enjoys the many different educational games and activities,
My son loves it. Loves getting hes tickets to be able to purchase stuff. He also gets a good feeling completing the stages.,
My daughter is learning a little better on this program than how i can teach her. This program makes learning fun,
My 5 year old son has autism and he just hasn't wanted to do much with ABC mouse. I think it's great and I will keep trying to get him to continue to work on it.,
We were loving this and was worth the money but it keeps crashing on my phone. Samsung Galaxy 10+ if someone could help!,
"my daughter loves the games, songs, and activities. helps her pick up concepts quickly!",
"I was just charged for it, even though I haven't used it for a year and was never given an email about upcoming charges. I tried to call but I can't even find a number and I don't want to send another message!",
"Definitely not worth the money !!$30 a month is ridiculous ,you can find free apps that teach more",
Do not try the free trial because they will charge your credit/debit card and not refund it back. Also good luck calling customer service because you wont get an answer,
"I can not get access on the app, I've downloaded the app and it gets as far as the optional survey but won't let me click anything",
i cannot log on it keeps messing up my computer is up to date and i deleted and reinstalled the app and it wont work need to cancel my trail,
"I think this is what I expect from an online app for kids, there can be some improvements but overall the concept is great !!",
"In computer I use it, but im 8 and at home I cant get past sighning in, I even asked my mom. She couldn't figure it out either. Please make it easier to sign into.",
This app is amazing it helps alot. The only thing I suggest is audio for reading because my brother is behind and his stuggling with reading.,
We first had problems signing ....now we can't get in we tried on all our devices and it won't get past a blue screen!!,
Can't get it running it. I paid this monthly but the app is lacking. Please fix as we are getting charged for it.,
I was charged 75 pence straight away when I sign up I wasn't aware of that it was meant to be 1 month free not very promising... I have now decided to delete the app,
Works perfect for me. Used on a 200 dollar tablet from Samsung. Anyone getting lag is probably just using a 100 dollar tablet.,
They have two many adds.they take over the internet.this app is poop and the adds.you should delete the app so it gets less suport so that they don't have adds.this app is only for desperet people.üí©üòæ,
I downloaded this for my son since I have a paid subscription but it runs horribly and it will not let me log in at all. I'm very dissatisfied.,
My kid really likes it. Been playing since 4.5-6 years old on/off occasionally. I think it's helped her writing... I'm grateful this app exists.,
My 4 year old loves it. The biggest issue is that some screens do not load all the way or they take a long time to load.,
This website is nothing but a scam they took my money however I can't log in it keeps saying my email and password are not in the system. However your taking my money & customer service is a joke.,
Unable to create child's account during set up. I uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Now I can't cancel.,
Trial cancelled still charged. Now wants to set up account on app and it doesnt work. I want my money back. This is poor customer service,
It takes too long to get down to business has to load the libraries and all of that lost my grandkids attention everytime I tried to get them on it had to cancel it,
Sneaky subscription practices...show no sign of a subscription in the play store and it is still charging me for an app that was deleted month ago...shady practices,
"This app has helped my grandson to improve more in his READING, Sight words, Math and more...thanks ABCmouse keep up with the good work.",
Doesn't even open,
downloaded app and created account but keeps freezing and crishing will not even let me go onto any activities such as the learning path or anything very dissappointed will not be getting again,
Both my girls love this app and I can see it is helping them understand the basic concepts of learning.,
my son loves it and I do too because not only is he learning hes having fun. when he wants to do it he says can I get my tickets please.,
Horrible. Force closes every single time Since having it for 3 days -_- Its completely useless. Will be unsubscribing and uninstalling ASAP,
"I cannot cancel my subscription the app never works and the website just says open app, I need to stop the payments!!!",
Definitely been a great learning tool for my 2 yr old,
"Good content, but the app is so slow that it's practically unusable. Please improve the load times",
Best app for kids. I used it pre k and have had a lot of good feed back from the teachers.,
"I got the ABC Mouse for my four year old granddaughter. It's been extremely helpful and keeps her busy. Hopefully, she'll be prepared for kindergarten!",
I just did the thing for 2 free months and noq when i download the app on the laptop it dont get me past the front page. And when i try to download the app on my phone it wont work,
It does not open properly to enter log in. What a waste of money. Looks like 1999 computer screen frozen.,
My son didn't like the app I cancelled after the free trial as he wasn't interested now just realised money has been getting taken from my account. Not happy at all.,
We love this website we've been using it for years now but the app needs work I have to keep restarting it for the kids to continue their work,
Very interactive and the lessons keep my child engaged. He is always ready to sit down with ABC Mouse.,
I am unable to even log on to this app! I did the trial run for this and I cant even use it! Is there someone that can help me with this issue??!,
"Learning path crashes on Amazon Kindle and some annoying ""talkback"" stuff happens on Samsung s10 even though ""talk back"" is not enabled.",
"My children have come so far and learned so much using this app. They wake up every morning ready to do ""homework"" lol.",
This is not a free app. No matter how you spin it. It freezes on screen and is slow to load.,
"I just purchased the age of learning app and the 8-13yr old app and already having issues. Startup page won't fit my screen, can't find the 8-13yr old app",
"Such a great learning app for my learning toddler....she loves the activities, the prizes and being able to earn and learn!!",
I cancelled my subscription weeks ago and they billed me as if I didn't cancel it. Now I have to figure out how to 1 cancel for good since cancelling it weeks ago obviously didn't work and get my money back üò°üò°üò°,
I love this app but it has been glitchy lately. It also started off with live classrooms and now that is no longer available,
App will not open on Lenovo Yoga Book running android 7.1.1! Freeze's on mouse load screen does not even display loading circle. Please fix.,
Stop working. Now it's just a blank yellow screen. Tried reinstalling and still not working.,
Great on an iphone. Horrible on an android. Totally different experiences and app performance.,
This app no longer works,
Extremely sluggish and laggy. Crashes constantly. Definitely not worth $12.99/month.,
It helps you learn,
Not user friendly,
Thank u guys for making those,
It's the best thing in the world kids love it you can do everything it's like my kids love it this is so fun thank you so much whoever can wait in this I love ABCmouse it's the best thing I ever saw but thank you very much .,
Im really good at these,
"Downloaded the app multiple times, but it never loads. Looks like I dodged a problem by the looks of other recent reviews.",
In app purchase of annual subscription for this app. Where's the notice? Free 30 day trial available. No thanks,
ABC mouse is awesome and definitely contributes to my child's learning. I would recommend to anyone.,
Another good 1 tu teach kids; and also keep kids occupied plus; it helps keep them out of their moms cabinets. U never know what they can get into when their moms get into a cleaning and organizing fit!!üòÅ,
My kids can not use it. when they click on it the full screen comes up on there laptops. As soon as they log in all the can see is the lower left corn of the page.,
"Love this App. It keeps my sons attention and stays on track toward his reading, writing, math and social studies goals. Thank you.",
I'm a kid and since school is out i though it would be a good idea to download it but you should not half to pay to learn if you have to pay when you get in the app so why not make the app on the app store cost money,
I really enjoyed using ABCmouse for many months to years however most recently I disapprove of their actions in teaching young children about evolution. That is a parent's decision and it goes against believers in God the father. The idea of evolution is not a fact and for ABCmouse to teach it as such I feel is unacceptable again especially for believers in God the Father and Jesus Christ His son. I won't be using ABCmouse unless supervised,
We have to sign in and we have to pay money or credit card for a free month wasting money I don't like it delete this learning app it's very annoying we have to pay for a free month.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò†üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,
I can't even log into the app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app on several devices and have the same problem on all of them.,
My granddaughter loves this app. My grandson really enjoyed it too. There are so many different activities for her to do so she is never bored!,
this app is great! Very educational and the children love it....they have fun learning and are always excited to use abcmouse,
"I wish I could at least open the app! If I try to sign in it tells me that I have that email registered already, but if I try to sign in it tells me that the emai was not found. I guess I'll download another app",
The app itself is great! There's just many times when it wont work because there are too many people using it at the same time.,
Less than a week after purchasing we cannot be access the content as it keeps saying that the app is offline even though there is working internet.,
My experience using abcmouse is very good. Hopefully she and he will get the most help getting my daughter and son already for school.,
"When it's actually running it keeps my kid engaged, but the loading sucks, it freezes, can't even get pass the main screen üôÑ",
"It takes forever for pages to load, and the app freezes up regularly. My kids don't want to use it for that reason",
is it just me or is everyone having a lagging problem??? it's very frustrating when you paid an annual fee!!,
"After paying for the app, It crashed and now it says my wifi network is offline. I tried installing and also refreshing my wifi. please help",
Our little ones have learned so much since we started doing the activities on this app. I highly reccomend it.,
"Thorough, engaging, exceptional and accessible. I love this for our 4 year old boy and girl twins!",
"The content is great and my child loves it, but the app is slow to load and can be less than responsive using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4",
I've un-subscribed several time for over a year and they keep taking my money... not happy with this app at all.,
Awesome app my daughter who is 2 loves it and is learning so much and is so happy to play everyday üòäüòä. I can't wait for my 1 year old son to start on it,
"I have a newer version of the samsung tablet, so I do not see why this app is not optimized for it? I cant even use it on the browser.",
"My childhood loves ABC Mouse! He looks forward to earning tickets, and doesnt even realize that he is learning. He has come a long way in a short period of time!",
"My kids absolutly love it! ABC Mouse has made them love learning, as well as having fun doing it.",
Not as great as how you all promoted it... my son is 4 and unable to use it by his self. But the graphics is awesome,
Works great on my phone besides a little freezing which only happened a few times. My kids love it.,
Very helpful and fun for my kids. My youngest loves it and doesn't even realize she is learning at the same time.,
The app was working fine and then all of a sudden it takes forever to load n then crashes.,
Their ads are annoying and they need to hire some cute chicks instead of these fuglies doing their ads now! If anything it makes me not want to buy ABC mouse,
Asks for zip code and when one is entered says its incorrect. im then blocked. Countries that do not have a zip or postal code cant get access.,
I read about this app on internet Downloaded it... It crashes... Thank you but will look into a other program that actually works...,
My daughter loves ABCmouse but 8 moves very slow and I can barely get anything done on it so I cancel my account try to reach customer service and it moves slow to get to customer service,
i love abc mouse it really teaches the kids. the only thing i dont like is it needs more books that reads to them .... and needs more spelling words,
This app runs extremely slowly waiting up to 5 minutes to open different apps within. No child is going to have the patience to wait this long each time they go on,
I absolutely love this app my four year old daughter she loves this app to she learns very fast and easily this app meets my expectations everybody should try it,
i been paying for this app and my son cant even play with it. we been trying to download it to my phone and is not letting me. is giving me a hard time. I feel like this app is stealing ur money every month and my son never played with it.,
We can't get the games to load on the app. Is there a certain level a child has to be on? My toddler said he was bored of the learning path.,
Helps my daughter and son in some extra work that they think is fun also. Highly recommend for younger children.,
Wonderful app. My kids absolutely love it!!! The reward system is so much fun for them!,
I just got charged this morning after trying to erase my card information from the app.. my son is 2 and hasnt & will not play on this app.. I need this fixed please & thank you!,
Screen flips around the phone and then just stays yellow. No use. I'll be seeking a refund.,
My daughter loves learning on here!! She loves the ticket rewards and actually enjoys all the different activities!!,
And you can get on level text however you want if you get on your cheek bigger on your person I don't think they're that happened but it's ABCmouse it's fun now did you watch ABC mouse on the video that subscribe button princesses scribe button and that knows Pace okay bye you also know that you're going to be able to get like tickets to buy stuff and like get stuff right so that's true and when you always give me the game it by Lloyd and then it'll say welcome back,
"Cannot use the app on not one but 2 of our devices. Been paying for almost 3 years and never used it. Now that we want to, we can't.",
My 2 year old son loves ABCmouse! His favourite app is the music videos. Entertaining and educational.,
Trash. This app sucks. They suck you into the trial and refuse to let you cancel. I'd better NOT see one dime of my money touched.,
Won't even work anymore. Even got a new phone app won't even open on any device. Useless.,
"My daughter loves this! She was quiet for a while, but warmed up to the songs and now sings along with them. Wonderful! Worth the money.",
Like the app but it is currently frozen we haven't been able to use for weeks and customer service is unnecessarily hard to reach,
Great app. Would be great if math aligned with level expectations but my daughter has learned a lot on the app.,
I used this app when i was younger than i am it whas awsome now im letting my younger sister have a chance because she has not had a chance to be at school so it will help her with a lot more stuff for schoolüñíüñíüñí,
Wonderful app! Keeps my sons attention and there have been signifigant improvments in his development since we started using ABC Mouse. Worth every cent!,
My 4 year old is going on her second week of ABC mouse and she absolutely loves it. I couldn't be happier!,
Isn't free. Won't even allow access without putting in an email linked to a paid membership.,
"Impossible to cancel, and they just keep charging your account. Awful customer service",
"Great for general entertainment for around 2, but going into 2 and a half I can tell our work with this app has paid off.",
the app takes forever to log on. it freezes while my son is in the middle of a lesson. it didn't keep his intrest,
"Engaging, fun, and a good way for kids to start basic life skills and responsibilities!!!!",
Really disappointed I read the reviews and i wish i did not sign up cuz the app does not work at all. I cant do nothing.. I'll be asking for a full refund... pls dont pay for this... until they fix there app.,
"The kids love it! They get to play for a reward, for good work finishing their responsibilities.",
My grandson loves the learning and the tickets after so he can go to the store. Best investment we could have made.,
"Love the variety of content, Grandson loves to hear stories from library. He also loves the games.",
Just downloaded the app just for it not to fit my screen (Samsung 2022 model). It's half of a black screen and mouse head,
When to getmy free trail and they tried to take money out of my account. Shameful. Lie about free trail. I've never even had abc mouse before,
I bought the year subscription and after one use it will not load,
App does not work 80% of the time,
"Works great on my phone, cannot get my tablet past the login screen - it just spins and freezes.",
I enjoy learning on ABC Mouse! Yay!,
This is the best game ever because I'm games you can watch videos you can play games you can have on French you can make pets you can shop 20% around and you can also I'm going to go get my table,
Has slowed down so badly that my daughter gets tired of waiting. Waste of money.,
As a 7 year old I know this is only game l played because this game is fun,
I LOVE IT I CAN LEARN EVERYTHING FROM HERE! üíóüíñüíù,
Past problems have been corrected. App works great and is fun learning for my child.,
Amazing app for children at home,
"My 2 and a half year old loves it, you made her happy, so I am happy üòä",
My son is improved more than I expected he is exceeded expectationshe's doing incredibly well and has gone further than we expected.when he gets excited to actually do school work it makes it to where we're excited for him.,
I don't know why but they keep charging when I was on the three day free trial. Also my daughter doesn't like because it keeps glitching. So I don't know why you charged me to pay.,
I pd for a yr $59 and for the assessment $39 yet can't open the app..i want my money back. I sent request to PayPal. Ridiculous the app doesn't open..had I seen the reviews I'd never paid..,
Female robot voice going 3x normal speed and you can't use the keyboard to sign in. I pay for this annually and can't even use it!,
I like the books the learning path the art the music the videos the games and dressing up! Get it now!,
be careful doesnt work on certain devices.....I just bought a new Dell desktop and not compatible.....love it for the kids though!,
They charge you without permission. I definitely canceled after the first week when my child had no interest in this app.,
Hi it's me a kid I actually really like ABCmouse and I actually really really like it because it actually teaches me different kind of thing every day every day I go on a next-level to go to go to a different Adventure every learning path and I shot and I actually got on to new endü§©ü§©üòçüòÄüôÉ‚ô•Ô∏è,
"My son is 4 years old he sit and enjoy A B C Mouse ,and it keep him quiet and he learning so much,he started PK, and he is ready, thank you A B C Mouse.",
"My 2 year old, 10 month old and I absolutely love ABC Mouse. I highly recommend this app. You won't have any regret!",
It's very educational :),
My 4 year old daughter enjoys it so much and I don't have any worries because it strictly educational. Win/Win!,
I can't enjoy the first free month because it won't load. it won't go past the yellow abc mouse page.,
Half the time it doesnt load. I have to exit and go Back in it. When it works its great.,
"After the free trial i was charged twice, is dt how it works? Though my kids like the app alot. Seen lot of improvement too tnx.",
Downloaded app to try free trial. Can't even log in the app is working so poorly. Disappointing.,
"Easy to use, full of great educational subjects We have been using it for 5 years, and my kids enjoy it.",
It is CONSTANTLY telling me my password is invalid & then won't let me reset it - so this app is useless as we cannot access it!,
"Lags terribly. Paid for my son to be able to use it, and he hasn't been able to access any of the lessons on the app.",
My granddaughter is learning so much. Extremely useful tool for learning and time management.,
The bunny hop activity stages 1-5 doesn't work. It will load but you only hear music. Fix the problem or you lose a customer,
Subscribed with my card and couldn't get access to the app. So I Uninstalled it and attempted to install it again but it's not downloading.....,
Never received a renewal notice and paid for another year despite my child aging out of the content. Shady accounting practices.,
Took money out of my account when I didn't download it or give permission to purchase it and won't refund me my money this app really sucks and I want my money back also in charge me another $9 just to cancel the app so again this at really sucks and I want my money back or I'm going to report you guys,
We use this in between our Abeka Academy curriculum for supplemental learning. It's quite addicting to the kids!,
"This is really good for kids. I have a 7 year old girl and a 5 year old boy they love it. Able to use on desktop as well, would definitely recommend!",
Maybe your app shouldn't say free with ads if you have to subscribe to a monthly subscription after you download.,
"ABC mouse is fun, very cute, easy to use app. It's perfect for children. A+",
It's actually really great it has done well for my children it has been an honor downloading this app and I'm not joking my 9 year old son in 3rd grade is now reading 5th grade level he is high above,
My daughter keeps trying to play but the screen won't do anything. Not trying to be paying monthly just for it not to work,
"Everything to help your child get ahead games, printouts as well as prizes to keep them engaged I recommend everyone get this app for their children",
It's unfortunate that you are required to pay for use when the app consistantly crashes and freezes.,
We haven't used the app in months. We tried canceling and can't. I just don't want to be charged anymore. I can't afford it,
Mouse is a really good game for your child because to help my child go to I hope my daughter get her running really fast and she knows how she barely knows how to meaning of tattoos,
"Just downloaded the app and it ts already freezing. Glad the first month is free, i wouldnt waste my money on it.",
My daughter absolutely loves ABC mouse and she is learning so much from it! She is 2.,
"ALL three of my kids love it and can navigate the app easily. My kids are 3, 5 & 8.",
good learning app it just the app itself that always crashes. just freezes every 2 minutes,
ABC mouse is an amazing educational site. My little sister loves this site and plays all of the educational games. 5 stars from me.,
"Your billing practices are horrible and bordering on the line of unethical.oh its easy to sign up but ive tried to cancel like 3 times and your company KEEPS trying to charge my credit card,smh",
My kids are already showing progress! They love playing the games and going through all the activities!,
All 3 of my boys are loving it and it's a great way to sharpen basic skills and make review fun for my 4th grader!,
She is 2 but not interested or able to do some of these things for her age. The graphics need to be alot better to catch the kids eyes.,
It looks like an amazing but I really hate when you have to enter your credit card information in order to take advantage of a free trial.,
I can't even download the app to cancel it they didn't even send out no email about renew it at all they just changed my account,
Love it . . . One of the best apps of all times . . . It's the best way to help children have fun with learning üòç,
"Love it but won't work properly, keeps freezing and won't work * please fix this or my annually membership will go to waste !",
Very entertaining and educational at the same time! My 2 year old granddaughter loves the interaction!,
It the most important game my daughter like playing Roblox with her phone so l took away the phone for the week only the weekend she gets it back and it teaches everything when she forgets l take it and give the iPad so that what I'm sharing today bye bye guys,
Has helped my daughter tremendously and she absolutely loves it! Definitely worth the money!,
Not entertaining and requires constant internet. My 3 year old found activities dull and app hard to navigate.,
Never opens or loads like it should. I‚Äôve used it on here before and it does the same thing on my Apple table.,
My son really likes it. He ask to do it every day. It makes me happy to see him learning and having fun. He even helps his little sister with it.,
"This has been an amazing learning app for my toddler! Best thing I have ever purchased, by far!",
My 2 year old daughter loves this app!! So many things to keep her engaged and learning!,
"ABCmouse com is a great website but the app is very slow, choppy, and buggy on my android phone and kindle fire tablet.",
love all the different activities that this app offers. my little tahliegha is learning so much and having a blast while doing it.,
"my daughter loves this program, she beggs me everyday to do her learning game. my son is just starting to use the program.",
This app is great but I have to keep uninstalling it to get it work every single day. I personally want my money back.,
Just doesn't work subscribe online and download the app but I can't type the log in info. Subscription cancelled.,
"My grandkids love this app. But there's no way to exit the app to get back to my browser, I have to restart my Samsung tablet to get out of it",
Excellent! My daughter is learning so much and retaining it at just 2 years old! Amazing,
Downlaoded it today and it took several hours to finally get into the main area and now it will not allow us to click on anything. Not impresed,
I cant even download the app. I have tried on every phone in my home. It wont download on any phone. So messed up.,
I just paid $45 for this app for my daughter and she can't even start her first program because it freeze and go straight back to the uninstall screen üòí i want my money back asap,
My son enjoys the app. It is easy to navigate. I'll have to see how much it is helping him after we have had it longer.,
Scam!!! Paid 59.99 and this is a scam. Reinstalled several times on IOS and Android. It freezes on the servey!!!!,
With all the different activities she seems to continue a little longer than just paper and pencil thanks,
"I loved this when i was young and when i was trying to play again i had trouble. Still, pretty good game and now im eight years old!",
ABC mouse is like so sos so soooooooo fun I'm on level seven load try it it will be fun you can read books you can buy toys clothes beds all the things and even you can see the theater you can go to the zoo to buy things you need tickets to get tickets you need to do things like read I book color and try and if you try it it will be fun you will see I'm correct,
"My account was charged fri 3rd of april 2020. I cancelled immediately because I had no access to this app for months. My account was then charged AGAIN for the same subscription fee today Sun April 5th 2020. I am pissed and I want my refund pronto, this is nonsense.",
The app is really slow I can't teach my kids anything because I can't get off the first page it doesn't load up and it's really pissing me off,
"Every time I try to open the app it stays on the 15 of 64.40mb screen, and won't let me do anything.",
Uninstalled and Cancelled Subscribtion. There is still no way to adjust puzzle levels despite what I was told.,
Tried to temporarily cancel my subscription but couldn't. Just wanted to cancel for now and start it up again later,
"Cancelled my subscription MONTHS ago and have tried calling about the 12.99 that continues to come out of my bank account every month, for the PAST 3 months now and still no answers....ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",
my baby is finally excited about learning dont.. dont be afraid to let your children play games they help build confidence i see a huge difference in my little one,
I just purchased a year of ABC mouse and a year of full access and it doesn't even load to any of our devices phone laptop or tablet very dissatisfied and disappointed...,
Load times are frustrating,
AWESOME APP FOR CHILDREN! My granddaughter loves it and so do I. Great learning experience for kids.,
"Great App. Keeps my child's attention. And the fun part is, he is learning!!!",
Hi. I thought payment will only be debited after 1 month??? Took money straight from my account! I 1st wanted to see how it works and if its worth it?,
App won't load at all. Samsung Galaxy S10. Not even that old of a phone. Frustrating.,
Very wonderful site for children I highly recommend it I have used it with both of my daughters and the price is worth it.,
"Subscribe first, unsubsccribe within 10mnts after. Web app super lag to load, mobile app super super lag to load, read reviews in PlayStore, immediately uninstall and unsubs.",
"This use to be my little dude's favorite app. Now, it's logged us out and won't allow us to log back in. Such a waste.",
"My four year old loves this app! He is learning so much! I would encourage everyone to get this app for their children, you won't be disappointed!",
"it's been more than a week now and this site keeps sticking, my child gets annoyed and lose interest.",
Can't log in from the app because the page doesn't load properly. It's a lot of money for an app I can no longer use.,
My4 year old grandson Loves this app. He has been enjoying and using it for over a year. He is now teaching his 1 year old sister how it works!,
"It,s a good learning game and it,s fun üíúüíñ I like it because you can pretend that your going to the store it,s so much fun.",
"App doesnt work, a voice thing happens and i cant login at all. 7/19/21 still broken.",
I think that this is a very important game for the kidoes so they can get better and math and so they can get very smart at know all the answers so they don't have to gess in there head,
You charged us $60 today for an app that we can't use on the only tablet my son uses. This app stinks!! Fix this optimized bug or give me my money back NOW!!!!!,

Issues where learning path freezes up on color pages. Wish I could remove color pages period. Child not interested in them.,
"My 3 year old grandson LOVES doing his school work every day! As he takes care of his pets, he's learning so much!",

"site is terrible cant even fully log in because it will not let me pick a hampster or fish, no way to skip it either you people will not answer a phone call, I'm attempting to cancel my account asap",
"Might as well write ""works best on iOS"" for this clunker of an Android app. Solid ideas behind it though.",

Warning!!! App doesn't work on tablets and the company will screw you out of as much money as possible. Ive yet to see this program interest a kid let alone benefit. They automatically charge you because they know after your child forgets about it you will too. Poor customer service! Good luck getting your money back!,
"This is a really great game my 8 and 7 year old do not want to stop learning, they wont stop asking can we play abcmouse.",
"My kids love it! Because the activities are fun, what they learn sticks with them. The only downfall is that it is slow to load, but that's only a small inconvenience.",
My three year old son has loved ABC Mouse since he turned two years old. He has so much fun learning.,

They want a monthly fee. Idc but label it better they got my email before I realized it was trick. Dont be fooled!,
Thank you guys for quick response and fix! The program is great my 4 yr old lost interest in other programs she loves this one.,
the site is slow even when i have full service from lesson to lesson it takes awhile to load and that causes my kids to loose interest.,
The app freezes after 2-3 lessons are completed! It's so frustrating!,
Why make the app premium because some people don't have credit cards to pay especially me I don't have one to be able to make my little brother learn.,
"App keeps crashing, I pay for it and my kid can't when play it",
I try to update and it won't. It starts and then at the end of downloading it still say update,
It puts me in mind of the app called tiny tap the only difference is you can actually subscribe to tiny tap without having t I have funds on an actual card,
My kids love this app and seem to be learning from it! I love that I can set a time limit in the app itself so that they don't spend hours and hours on it.,
"The app has a lot of crashing and telling my kids that they have no internet, this issue should be fixed.",
This app is for kids ages two through eight and you can do anything you want it's free I want to install this app because I want to watch the video and then login to abcmouse.,
"My daughter has been wanting to try this, finally signed up and downloaded it and the app doesnt even work.",
it may be child safe but I tried to sing up for free it I still have to pay money when I tried to do it for free and it sometimes it keeps freezing,
Do not down load keeps trying to charge me wont let me log in so i can cancel it have to put in card numbers to order to beable to log in i just want to cancel stop trying to charge my card,
Had a subscription for two years I did not know I had it shows clearly on my bill yet they won't give me my money back or new subscription,
Can't login. Not happy. Just spins How long is this going to take to fix. Otherwise cancel my service,
my daughter absolutely loves this app! she gets so excited when i mention thay it's time to start!! AMAZING!,
My son loves this app. He goes on it all by himself and laughs and smiles while playing the games. I would recommend this app!!!,
App is ridiculous doesn't let you do anything doesn't let you cancel I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS!!!. although ABCmouse is great the IS TRASH,
It is stupid it requires payment to get in this app sucks I wish I never installed it I deleted all of my apps for the stupid game and I never want to see it again my students are not happy!,
Our daughter absolutely loves getting on ABCmouse!! We love this app and definitely recommend this to all parents!!,
it wont even let me download the app. Very disappointed and it wont let me cancel the subscription either.,
trying to cancel account and they won't let me. Also they keep charging my debit card and I already called and cancelled.,
Can't seem to access the app at all! Would like to cancel my membership before the free trial ends!,
I love this app but the coloring activity on learning path doesn't color and you can't skip ahead.,
The app is very slow I'm very disappointed. We paid and used it once then it froze what a scam!,
"Waste of $$$ My 5 year old lost interest in 15 minutes, said it was too easy, not challenging.",
I love this app for my younger children I just wish there was more advanced material for my 3rd grade 8 year old and older to at least grade 5!,
"App keeps freezing and we have to restart after each lesson, very annoyed.",
"My 3 year old grandson just loves this. he just graduated from toddler time into preschool. he enjoys the pet park, the aquarium and his hamster cage which teaches responsibility. Excellent program",
"This has to be the most terrible app I have ever delt with, did not even allow me to have my son take 1 class, crashes leterally every 10 seconds",
Doesn't work. Downloaded and it just freezes on multiple devices after sign in.,
It's so boring it's for babies and I hate the ads but they keep saying it's so fun but it's not so boring and I already told unikitty about this I hate whoever made it I just want the a cat to gobble that mouse up,
My 3yo daughter Nicole found this app uninteresting very quickly. I paid for the trial and app immediately shut down. Uninstalling soon.,
Too difficult to figure. My three year old gets frustrated trying to use this program,
"Too expensive, kids don't like it much, found better app: khan academy. My kids like it way better, and its free!",
Piece of junk! Won't install on a Galaxy Tab A. Tried running maintenance to make sure nothing is conflicting or any memory errors but to no avail.,
Not able to enjoy the app after being told email is incorrect and constantly being asked to download the app multiple times,
ABCmouse is bad because never responds it makes me rage makes me quit the app makes me shut down my whole phone and it's very easy to delete it and it broke my touchscreen,
"You download the app to pay for a subscription. You get a month free, but what's the point? I uninstalled immediately after downloading it.",
"My daughter is 5 and JUST about to go into kindergarten when COVID happened. This app has given me a sense of continued education and helped us to prepare her for Kindergarten.. which will be a homeschool curriculum style and so I am very grateful to have the suggested curriculum and scheduling provided through this app. As a single mother I never knew how I was going to homeschool when all this happened, thank you for this tool!",
I hate everyone that rates 1 star just because it doesn't work on mobile. It's a really good game on PC and thwy should visit the site the developers are saying they should.,
App doesn't even open on my phone. I'd like my subscription money back ASAP. If I can't use it what's the point in just giving my money away.,
"Good world building and she loves the abc mouse shows and feeding her pets and enjoys the lessons. But we got very upset when they put a story about being scared of the dark in her learning path. For 3.5 years wepurposefully never mentioned ""afraid of the dark"" and our child had no thought that she even should be afraid of the dark. We did not appreciate abc mouse implanting this suggestion at all. If a child is afraid of the dark the parents will surely already be addressing it.",
I've been trying to cancel this subscription and cant seem to figure it out. we haven't used this app for over 3 months and I'm tired of paying for it,
My daughter is 3 years old. She like ABCMouse alot.... She is learning a lot. It really works.,
"Sucks. You pay, and it dont teach. Isnt organized. Just another developer trying to make money. Period.",
"Very cumbersome and opaque billing process, does every trick in the book to quietly steal your money. Avoid.",
My 5 year old loves it and can work independently on it. He will call me over from time to time to look at his work and show me his self designed aquariums.,
Fix optimization for tablets. All of sudden does not load learning path lessons.,
The best learning source out there. Very amazed with the results I see daily with my kids.,
The very best experience of kids learning... Wow!!,
Execellent for all three kids however one of mine repeated the grade and I cannot go back a grade lesson without contacting the support.,
"I don't like it. I've heard that this is a great game for little kids, like my little brother. I have to pay to use it and IM ONLY A KID!! I downloaded this to help my little brother in school, but all I got was a peice of junk. This is worthless!!üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò°üò°üò°",
I'm not gonna be paying for something that my kids can't use the app is not working and I've already done all the steps too clear it up and still not work I want a refund!,
"Love this on the computer, but I couldn't even log in on the phone app because the log in screen is screwed up.",
Can't even login cause when I downloaded the app it goes to a login line the website from the app and is all glitched and huge and my phone is a Samsung galaxy s21,
"Paid for it but, app won't even open up. (smh) now having problems removing my debit card from this app. üò°üò°",
This app is extremely slow! I can't even get past the login screen to open the app fully!,
im teying to register and its already being a pain in the ass. i am too impatient to have to click the sane button 5 times!!!!! keeps it up im cancelling in the bext 5 mins,
This is a great game so things to do always so many new games every day so much to explore and always something for you to find in this app a great game for a great review,
I just installed it and was working fine and now it keep shutting down can't gett my son to do anything when it shuts down!!! Please fix it!!!,
My eldest child used ABCMOUSE AND EXCELLED GREATLY. WE LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR OUR YOUNGEST CHILD TO TRY IT ON THE CELL PHONE COME CHRISTMAS 2023 WHEN SHE WILL BE 2 YEARS OLD.,
Not Working!! I have the app downloaded but it just continues go get stuck in a loading screen.,
This is an awesome app . my 5 year old and 2 year old are learning so much . it keeps them interested,
This app is AWFUL!!! Y'all just took the $9.95 out of my account for the first month and now it won't even download back onto the tablet after my daughter unintentionally uninstalled it..... so how's about you put my money back in my account and good riddance to your failed technology,
It's great! It has educational games for my 3yrs old and 6yrs old. It has books and more.,
I bought the year subscription and I have it on my laptop however trying to add app to my daughter phone and app won't load says I'm off line when I not.. please fix so I can get my money worth,
Excellent app for kids especially during this lockdown period. The only problem is expensive subscription,
This app isn't loading or giving me and my child access. And the subscription was paid in full for 6months.,
"Cant login to cancel my subscrption, beacuse it will not load. And when i try to chat with costomer service the page frezzes up",
Come on ABC mouse it worked great for a week now it won't load and will freeze if I am going to be paying for this app this need to be fixed,
Non existent customer service. I've been having issues with this program and no one has yet to respond to my multiple inquiries.,
abc mouse is fun and cool you even get to go see the learning path and your own house and your school and the pet park and everything else u can also earn tickets for pets tubes and more abc.mouse com download it and u can also change your Avatar.,
So I subscribed for a year I'm trying to create a profile for my 2 year old daughter but everytime I click continue after we create her avatar it says error.no offence but it's really aggravating that I paid $60.00  for something I can't use.I need this fixed or I'll need a refund thanks,
doesn't stay connected to the internet. takes ages to load. frustrats the child wanting to play.,
Amazing! My 6 and 4 year old are improving SO MUCH! One of the best things I've ever done for them!,
"I can't even get past the log in page on her tablet. Uninstalled and tried again, still nothing.",
My 3 yr old loves the games and I'm always surprised at how well she can do the letters and numbers without my help!,
There is no log in button. It only says log out and sign in. Uninstalled and got the updated version too....,
"Great site/app, especially during distance learning! Lucky to have something reliable right now.",
"We absolutely LOVE ABC mouse! All of my kids beg to play, they have no idea they are learning ü•∞",
I keep trying to download app but its gets to 72% everytime & will not download any further. Can you please fix this so I can add app to my sons phone!?,
My daughter has loved abc mouse since she was 3 she's now 11 and enjoys reading the books on this app. Great app for educational purposes.,
I canceled this and still got charged again. Not happy at all.... Now I have to download the app again just to be able to try to do anything about it.,
I canceled subscription moooonntthhssss ago and yet it is still charging me monthly! Can this be removed please such a hassle to do a simple thing!!!!!,
Really good on the phone hands on. But not much on the computer for small kids.,
Excellent program! My baby is 21 months and loves ABC mouse. She asks for it all the time!,
it is way to slow when changing activity . that my 4 year son..gets frustrated in waiting that he just click out of it.,
It should be a nice app if only you can have access. Tried so many times today but never been able to open it. Of course I will ask for a refund,
Ive paid for a whole year and my son cant use it without wifi constantly connected. This is crazy wish i could get my money back.,
"Great app for the babies, my son and daughter love this app, awesome app to keep kids sharp and great app for the new learners",
Unable to find cancel subscription info. Did not realize I purchased this app. I don't even have children.,
Kids love it and so do I... I never worry about them playing abc mouse and I love hearing what my kids learn.,
"My daughter loves this app although it does run a little slow at times, she's learning and having fun at the same time",
My baby girl loves this app she always has to go to her school I think this is the greatest thing they could have came out with for little kids,
My son loves this app! He'll be starting kindergarten remotely so we're using this to prepare for online learning.,
I am not happy at all. Bought a one year subscription and I can't even log in. I want my money back!!!,
its very good for children to learn and enjoy the exiting way of learning the colors and ABC,
My 4 year old loves this app. He feels like he is playing a game and I know while he is having fun he is also learning.,
I've uninstalled and reinstall multiple time. I just wanted something my kid could actually use for learning.,
"For the past week during a session, it gets frozen and I need to restart the app all over again.",
I got 3 months free because I couldn't login. Here we are a few weeks out and I can't login again. This is not a new app. This should not be a problem.,
I love it but it constantly freezes. I'm fxxking getting super pissed right now. Some body fix this app.,
I keep trying to cancel my subscription and it won't let me. Also it was crashing on me a lot. So just not a good fit for us.,
"Great resource for multiple learning moments with awesome games, songs and much, much more!!!",
"I may be over the age limit by now....BUT IT'S STILL FUN!! so much fun. I. JUST. LOVE. THIS. GAME............I really recommend it.(sorry if recommend is spelt wrong) if you played and didn't like it...THATS JUST OOFS FOR YOU.I also understand. I SAW a game that LOOKED LIKE FUN BUT WASN'T...anyways, gave it a five star. Adi√≤s!",
This is so annoying....why would they even try to charge my card after my kids didn't even have the pleasure of using the app at all...it doesn't work...it's annoying I can't even get to log in...and I want to take this off my card pwrmantly and I'm not getting to do so...I am going to take this further legally if I have to...almost seems like a scam ....I'm so displaced I'm tryin this one more time to log in and take it off my card or I'm really going to have to go to my cousin about.so angry!!,
Loveeeee it. Great app Got a year subscription. My 3 year old loves it. And she is LEARNING ! IS WORTH IT.,
Fun learning experience for kids! My daughter started ABC MOUSE in Preschool and is still using it in Kindergarten.,
I love watching my daughter learn so much and have a smile the whole time I just tell her it's time for school and she runs to the computer,
"Waste of time people, everything went smoothly until the company took my creditcard info. Then, puaaff!!, I could not even login. Look somewhere else!!",
"I would give them 0 stars if possible. These crooked ass people charged me months after canceling on a day that I need that money to eat lunch. Good app, BUT HORRIBLE SERVICE & THEY WILL CHARGE YOU EVEN IF YOU CANCEL.",
I just subscribed and installed but cannot open the app because it keeps on crashing. Trash,
HOW DO I CANCEL THE APP. I've been charged twice now and I don't approve this-- but I can't find the link to stop it from doing it again. ü§¨ü§¨,
I dont think its right that kids have to pay to learn something thats more important than adults games that are free...SHAME ON YOU GUYS FOR TAKING ADVANTINGE OF THE KIDS...CHANGE IT FOR THE KIDS AND STOP CHASING THE MONEY.MY SON NEEDS THIS AND FOR FREE TOO!!!,
"App isn't working, takes forever to load every page. Paid subscription I can't even use",
Downloaded app thought it was free but tried to make me sign a subscription should tell you before u download deleted the app all together a form of false advertising,
ABC mouse has an amazing ability to Teach through fun and engaging age appropriate videos and activities,
This app. Is amazing if you want or need a teaching tool for your child they don't get better than this one.,
I downloaded this for my kids and it does not work what so ever. I can log in and after that it freezes. A waste of money.,
I played when i was in Kindergarten. Not when COVID-19 happen. I played this when I was 5 or 6 years old. I love this I am almost 8 years old. That mean I almost gonna use Adventure Academy.,
I updated the App and it doesn't work. Keeps sending me to the play store.,
Just a platform to buy a subscription. Can't do anything unless you provide credit card. Booooüëé,
So far so good! My 4yr old grandson loves it this far. We have had it for almost 30 days and he has made so much progress.,
So far not great but it just be my device need help Signed up for the subscrition but everytime i download the app it downloads till 72% then stops.,
My kids love it they will sit on it the whole day home schooling is amazing with An mouse because I can have them sit in the kitchen and play the game and I can make food they are in 1st and 2nd grade please go higher,
I need my money back from all the months you have charged me. Not using this at all. Tried to cancel and you make it impossible,
"Love the games and learning levels, my 3 year old repeats what they say and it's helping him remember the letters and numbers",
I can't give any star for this app cause I've downloaded it and it's not even opening up after I sign up all my information so I'll like to moved my info and get off this app.,
Really? I just paid for a 6 month subscription and now suddenly the app is so glitchy it won't even open.,
My daughter has greatly benefited from this program. At 4 she can write all her letters and numbers. She is starting to read on her own.,
My son loves to see his sister play this but i tried to install the app and When I open the app it is stuck on the scren with no loading circle. I am really bummed.,
She has grown to understanding ways of compression and how to play games and loves math now. Thanks,
Its easy to sign up but when you want to get in contact with customers service the page is blank.,
App no longer works. Wish I could get my money back. Was great until the last update. Paid for something I can't even use,
"Doesn't load half the games properly at all, daughter gets frustrated with it frequently because they don't load.",
An excellent option to maintain and advance knowledge and skills during these trying times.,
My daughter loves this. I love it. But now they continue to charge me and not let me log in. Ive hit up customer care and got an answer saying they would look into it and still charging me and still not letting me log in. Idk,
Not sure why I was charged $15 when I didn't subscribe? I did a trial but never authorized to have $15/month taken out of my account. ü§î,
It's helping me in ways that I didn't think it could and I appreciate it everyday for helping my son love learning.,
"So far I see that it's going to be, a very awesome üíØüòéüí´üòé tool for me to have, as well as use in teaching all of my grandkids when they are with me. I'm so excited to use",
My 2.5 yo loves this app. We actully paid for it because i love her using it. She can navigate it herself and play what she wants.,
Terrible - charge your card after quitting. A very so-so product that they want to charge you monthly for.,
My 4 year old twins love this app one of them can now play twinkle twinkle little star on the piano. And they were telling me all about primary colors last night I'm loving it,
Fairly easy to follow. 2 year old loves the pet park. The spanish is also nice feature.,
This is the best use of screen time for my little one. He enjoys being on the app and often asks to use it.,
I love it I child my child was it and it's really great and also she does it every day and he's getting ready for school,
I just paid for the annual membership and the additional program for 39.99 and i can't even download the flippin app!!,

Just paid for a year and cannot get it to load on either lonovo tablets. It is barely working on my phone.,
My 3 & 1/2 year old loves this app! I like her playing because she is learning and problem solving.,
"Works well. Lots of different activities. My 3yr old will ask to use the app to ""play games.""",

"Our grandson loves it. He looks forward to feeding his pets, as well as the puzzles and coloring.",
I love this app however I had to cancel the subscription because the app is no longer compatible with my children tablets,
Really has helped my autistic son on developing more his vocabulary. Also has increased his engagement in doing exercises,
Set it up for my students yet when we go to use the app it wont load up for use log in just goes to blue screen and does nothing else,
"The app freezes alot, has trouble loading to even get into it and freezes between screens",
App keeps freezing in loading page and withing the activities. Very frustrating.,
lately the app has not been loading just spins and spins...we do pay for this service.However have not been able to use it.,
my daughter has always been smart. but ABC mouse has helped her progress even further.,
"App is Always in ""loading""mode. Hardly ever works. Shouldn't have to pay for this to not be able to use it.",
The app is very slow. I just dont know if I have the patience for it. My kids love it but it takes so long to load from one thing to another,
"everything is good with every mouse, but I need to ask you something, please here is ok, basically, you got to pay for it, and I hate this really that's messed up Mr. You're trying to help kids' education, you should know the least make it free dumb",
Kid loves it and is actually wanting to play it on off times. Skills have noticeably improved in about a week in!,
Great customer support. Couldn't log on and they were able to fix the problem. My daughter loves this app,
"I can only install it on my phone for my children.. My computer says it is not compatability, my tablet says the Samething. Not too happy",
My Granddaughter asked me for ABC mouse and I'm so happy I got it for her! It is worth every penny! Couldn't be more satisfied.,
the app keeps buffering and I didnt even get past the profile part I just paid over $50 I want my money back I will work with one of the free apps,
I cancelled abc mouse and they still took out the money. Wasn't happy with their service and cancelled and now won't let me into the account or cannot contact them,
"Freezing up and glitching, did good for 2 weeks ans now cant even get on it.. Ugh!!!!!!!",
I love this app. It is entertaing and usefull. My son gets super excited when he hears it uploading on his tablet.,
I'm having trouble with the app on my kids tablet. Gives an Error message saying Failed to extract resources needed by il2cpp. Any help.,
"Keeps freezing and at time completely unresponsive, canceling my subscription because of this.",
As a special education teacher this app is horribly overpriced for those in my community who cannot afford it as a teacher who also has to pay out of pocket for this app it shuts down when one or more of my students are using it at the same time,
My favorite!! My little girl loved this we shared alot of memories through interacting with this app on our 62 inch LG. I WILL NEVER FORGET,
Just downloaded the app. Kids are enjoying. I want to find out how add more than a kid. They are 3 but I have only manage to add the youngest one. How do I add the big siblings?,
Awesome and engaging learning app that make it fun for kids and keeps their attention.,
Normally if I was not 10 and in 4th grade then I would put 5 stars but I'm in fourth grade and I'm 10 and this is For second graders and I'm not a second grader I'm in fourth grade and actually I do love this game it's really fun but it's not that great when you're in fourth grade and the highest you can go is up to second grade but i still love it,
i am having trouble installing abc mouse and i get one month free and then ztart paying please cancel my subscription and dont take any money from my checking account,
Worst app it didnt work the entire time i had it and it is a pain trying to ppen the app just to cancel the subscription,
"Just bought the membership, it worked for one day and has been nothing but errors and frustration since.",
I keep getting charged twice for some reason. Contacted the company but got no response back from them.,
"I love this app because you can play any game you want to play my favorite part of the game is the puzzle,art,fish and pets.",
My 2.5 year old and I like the app but I really wish the app would work without being connected to wifi.,
"Horrible, they brag about how it's easy learning for kids at an early age but it cost money, so I dont like it",
ABC mouse is amazing.These past couple of years my daughter has been playing ABC mouse. I hope school can keep up with her. I am planning on letting my son do this,
ABCmouse takes a long time to load and when it load it says 504 gateway time out my internet is fast and my device has lots of space so can you guys please dind a way to fix the problem please and thank you if atleats took the time to look at the comment,
i think it could be more challenging for his level but he loves the app its definitely worth the money,
This app was the worst it didn't teach my kid anything she is a fast learner it just can't help her you need to make harder levels and lives in this app this app my little girl is n't asleep going on through,
My son is 95% through the first grade but the next one to click on the learning path just keeps loading fix so my so can finish and get his certificate please üôè,
Poor because I have three children and not once have you offered a free version I feel disadvantaged and slighted that many parents with money can use your game but children like mine will never know the joy of being ready for school because you still don't give a free version and you never bothered to respond to my first rating,
This app will not even stay open. It opens and immediately closes back down.,
Pleasant nice books for children unfortunately I don't have any and it's the only reasonable choice for another prize that is appearing to fall into FTC REPORTING,
My five year old absolutely loves this app!! It really has helped her grow academically.,
Too much clutter in the app. Need a simple interface for kids brains.,
Good exercise for my son however we can't seem to get passed a glitch that is preventing my son to progress the learning path beyond 71% of level 6.,
A lot of log in issues and takes forever to load. Not worth the money.,
App is great! All 3 of our children enjoy and look forward to using it!,
All it does is freeze or stop loading when you go back doesn't matter if on wifi or data.,
It's a very good learning game but I only do it in school for some reason they force a very smart 7 year old to do it ughüò†üò≠üòî,
"Went online, signed up for free month, downloaded app and CAN NOT even log into the app. Will not let me type my sign in information.",
"My child enjoys it. It freezes, or he gets stuck occasionally though.",
This app has been FANTASTIC during these complicated times. My kids love it and have learned so much!,
It was great til they did an update. Now it keeps crashing before it even loads,
I LOVE IT! The only thing is that sometimes it takes a long time to load everything. And it has nothing to do with the wifi connection.,
A lot of glitches and app freezing multiple times!! Spent money on an app that is glitchy !!,
"full of glitches, freezes, frustrating for me... can't imagine how my 3yr old feels.",
Not helpful and it forces you to download this unhelpful app. Hard to login and going to cancel soon.,
very buggy. stopped working after 10 minutes and reinstalling didn't help.,
Great for both my kids I have been with ABC Mouse for 11yrs and it has been such an amazing learning tool.,
This app is wonderful. Teaches the kids everything they need and want to know. It's definitely worth the download.,
i just spent money on this yesterday and my children have yet to be able to play cause the screen on the app gets small and it wont let you click on anything!! couldnt even finish puttin in the info it askes for? nor can i get onto anywhere to get my money back?!,
I'm only a kid and I can't pay for it I am really mad and very disappointed in ABC mouse in the ads I watched that didint even say anything about paying or having t PUT YOUR ADDRESS IN SO SO THAY CAN ROB YOU!!!!!!!!,
Both of my kids have grown so much using this app and they have so much fun with it ! Thank you ABC MOUSE üíó,
"My 6 yr old and I were excited to try it, but the loading time is just way too slow!:(",
Just bought a full subscription and can't open it. Reloaded twice and just won't open up,
"This is a great app my child lovvves it but sometimes it would take long to load. Like it, nothing's wrong accept slow loads",
I can't log in! The log in screen will not let me type anything. Very frustrating,
Worth every penny... kids love it and learn at same time. Should of bought it sooner.,
"So far not happy the app on my phone is very slow, will not load, and it times out on the computer",
My son has made such strides in his learning from using this app. I recommend every child get a chance to use it.,
Not friendly to use for my child. He prefers to play with the pets other than do the lessons.,
This app is the first time my kid tried this type of app and hated it and then her tablet died for good an we got charged another 6 years no refund. ADDED: WE HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THEM NOT CANCELLING SUBSCRIPTIONS WHEN ASKED. ABCmouse please cancel my subscription,
4 stars is ok üëç yes there is a little bit of ads but not too much.I downloaded it and I love it so I would recommend it.üòÅ,
"Regards to all of our 3rd of July, so you know. The list is a good time. The list is a good idea to advertise your business",
it's fun my daughter likes it but the app FREEZES CONSTANTLY I have to keep restarting it and it is very annoying.,
My son loves the ABC mouse apps . He loves listening to the videos the most and he learns so much new things.,
Can't even get on to use it the screen loads up and stays on the yellow screen after loging in waste of money,
Can't get pass the login I will enter my stuff and it gives me a login in problem for grown up and takes right back to the login agian,
I had this app for my kid for about 2 days and wen he uses it it just doesn't look fun its just to childrendi i guss and she is like 8 and she said to me it was to childrensi and no hate when i soll the add i was like oh this is something my son may like but im just like no she didn't learn anything from it so yep,
Takes twenty minutes to get to the cartoons. In a busy restaurant with a 3 year old and 18 month old it was unacceptable.,
Pure trash! Wouldn't even get past the loading screen!,
It does not allow to sign up ....How can a new customer installing this app directly sign in when he first needs to sign up ?,
it is really great for litte kids to learn it helped me when I was little I was so bad at learninggand soon has i got on abc mouse i was learning so fast,
Very good so far. Do not like when we travel because only gives songs to do. üòï‚òπüôÅ,
"I like playing with ABCmouse,that what my 5 years old son says about abcmouse, What I think about abcmouse is it is good learning tool my son and he loves it so much,and thank you and God bless you. üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüí™üèæüí™üèæüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ",
"Good app, but it doesn't work for the oneplus 10T that I just bought. I am paying for this app and I cant use it, can you please assist.",
I love this app it is helpful and now I can learn on the day off and it is sooo cool I love it so much and I am only 7 in 2nd grade it is sooo awesome :D!!!,
"It really works for my hispanic Child to learn English! I recommend it! Funciona muy bien para mi ni√±a aprender Ingl√©s, la recomiendo!",
My daughter loves playing ABC MOUSE. She learns a lot from counting and reading/spelling sight words,
My 4&5 year olds are excelling with this program! I wish I had started them on it sooner!,
Download app won't even let you log in and there web site makes you download the app can't even do anything either way what a waste of time,
It will never load. Worked for about 5 minutes then it never stopped loading.,
Happy my daughter's learning lots about different things but wish the reading portion was stronger because this is where she struggles.,
settings dont work and games freeze often. in talks with customer service to resolve issues.,
This app is TERRIBLE. Has no problem loading the page where they want me to spend MORE money but cannot load ANYTHING else,
I absolutely love this app! My 4 year old has progressed so quickly within only one week,
My daughter Keoshia is 7 years old and is doing so good shes learning so much so fast and its very nice to see the difference she loves tha activities and the pets,
Takes forever to load! This app is ridiculous. How can we get a toddler to be interested in it if everything takes long to load?!,
Very helpful and tends to my child's individual learning needs.,
This app was great until the learning path stopped working. Please fix. Thank you!,
Freezes alot. Have to exit out and go back in the app often. Basically after every 2 activities,
"My daughter can take it anywhere and keeps learning, even on long car rides!",
My son loves it. A fun way for them to learn. He has learnt a lot since we started using this app.,
My son is reading and he loves to play and learn. Its helping him enjoy school so much!,
"Unlike the VAST MAJORITY of EVERY SINGLE OTHER APP AVAILABLE IN EXISTENCE, THIS ONE SPECIFIC APPLICATION DOESN'T NEED WORD OF MOUTH PERSONAL OPINION REVIEWS IN THE WAY THAT MOST AVAILABLE TO DOWNLOAD, THE ABSOLUTE AMAZING WORLD WIDE AS WELL AS TV, THRU OUT ALL THE INTERNET,. EVERYWHERE ANNOUNCES EXTREME HIGHEST PRAISE POSSIBLE. IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE ALL OVER THE WORLD... IT'S THE SINGLE MOST IMPRESSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS EVER CREATED, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING IT'S FOR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN",
The lag the lag the lag...the info and activities are great. But the lag makes it so difficult to enjoy and stay focused,
ABC mouse is a app for kids there are games puzzles art they never run out of things they just add new stuff! I LOVE ABC MOUSE,
Canceled this app before free trail was up and been charged every month and cant figure out how to email or anything to get it stopped,
I have made payment but app has been loading for hours. Hvnt been able to download on my daughter's tab and it cannot work without me downloading the app.,
not good. paid for a year then tried to set it up and the app keeps frezzing up.,
"My son got so board with this app he hasn't played with in months, however, as ABCmouse DOES NOT allow refunds I stuck paying a useless service for my child.",
I like the app but I can't log into the app through my phone. And I can't get ahold of customer support. Need help,
Not happy by any means with this app its so slow that my kids dont even play on it cause they lose interest waiting for it to load to play waste of money,
This app is really repetitive like every app I play your ad keeps showing up and it's annoying!,
"My kiddo loves this, and gets a lot from it. She is 27 and a special needs learner. That's right, it is not just for little kids.",
Incredible when it works. Sometimes it lags and sometimes it doesnt load at all,
I love the curriculum but its lagged way too often. Sometimes wont even work at all for days.,
I havent been able to load for 6 days after re subscribing. Can't get a hold of anybody to help me either :( just disappointed,
"Stuck on a level in the learning path, waiting for the costumer support to answer.",
I love this app it's so much fun and its good for kids and adults but I have a problem can you make it free please I have no money left so can you please make it free so my daughter can learn but I still love this appü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞üíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüòçüòçüòçüòç,
"Won't load, my daughter only used this app once and now won't load just comes up with a loading screen nonstop.",
My children are growing up so I no longer need ABCmouse. I need to cancel my subscription. It has been beautiful.,
this app runs very slow. My kids spend most of their time waiting for it to load. Definitely not pleased.,
I think it should be completely free without having to pay with a credit card it seems like a great program but why isn't it free like any other school,
"this app is very very very amazing. the kids love it and I as the parent is very much amazed by it. I totally recommend this app, you'll never regret it.",
Be nice if it didn't update everything my kid wanted to use it. B6 the time it's done he's lost interest.,
The app is amazing I downloaded this for my sister to help with her reading and she loves it üôÇüôÇüôÇ,
"It's to expensive, would Love for my kids to try this out but of course it's money first then education for kids.",
When I open the app. It's just a yellow screen now. Nothing loads. Trash.,
"My great, great niece loves ABCMouse!",
Never loads keepa crashing,
"Great app my child loves it so much she learns ALOT it helped her go through kinder, first grade, and 2nd thank you so much for making this app",
Why does the app not work when you want to cancel? I click on it and it turns yellow and stays yellow.,
"Love this!! People complain thats its 9.99 or 12.99 per month, but my child's education is worth the two Starbucks coffees I have to give up a month! Not to mention, covid caused inflation in every area. Hulu and netflix increased, what's another $2 for education and learning? My kids love this app and I love that they pick this over xbox!",
its really helpful I don't need to teach him myself. when it is time for bed he will not be able to leave it for 1 minute,

My granddaughter loves this app because it's fun. I love it becase she is learning while she has fun!,
Both of my older kids love it at first it was a little rocky but now they are willing to play and learn from this app everyday üòäüòä,
I cancelled my subscription and am still being charged. Contacted customer service 3 times. Calling the Better Business Bureau Monday. Terrible customer service.,
they have been taking money out my account for the last three months after i have sent numerous emails stating i didnt want this. Very disappointed,
I did not sign up and am being charged and I'm trying to use the app to clear this up but cant get thru it!!,
"You guys are not serious i have downloaded this app twice but every time i try to login it decline claiming √†m offline,,,!!! Why are you consuming my mbs and later claim that im offline!!! Why are u advertising something that doesnt exist!!!!",
"My son, who hates sitting down learning, loves this app. The fact that it's like a game he really loves. He asks to do his ""lessons"".",
This app helped me to teach my 2 yr old grandson to read. He is now 6 and reads at 4th grade level.,
"My kids love it, and everything on it is educational so I don't have to worry what they are watching or doing.",

"im sure this is a great app, however i cannot get it to load for the life of me! Hopefully this can be addressed because if not i will have to download something else ..üòë",
My son loves ABC Mouse but since I downloaded it on his new tablet and it is not working.It just jumps and flashes.,
App rarely open on my son's tablet or on any phone. When it does open it lags terrible.,
Always freezes. The learning path dots aren't there for my son to be able to move on the next lesson. Its been a real pain lately.,
I love this game because it helps me learn so much and I just like this game because it was fun that has games on it but I already know why not because this game mother game in math but this game still house me and it's a good game I love this game cuz it had fun game and it's easy and yeah and I love the little lion guard game but like I like all the games on here and I hope everybody else hits like or whatever if you don't like this game was in your missing out or if you're too big of a kid,
I highly recommend this learning app to anyone with children.,
Great when it's working. Takes longer to transistion between activities than other apps.,
Thank y'all for addressing my issues and concerns. My son and I will work together using your product to learn how to read this summer. I reccomend this product to anyone with inquisitive children,
Glad it gave me a free trial that I won't be renewing. All it does is buffer and freeze,
"Just signed up, my son is excited to use it but the app will not open and I can't login online. Help!",
I love it. My son loves it. He gets excited to feed his pets and play with them. He also learns a lot from it too.,
"Very helpful, my daughter is learning a lot and enjoys reading more.",
Terrible app... always freezes up....how can you expect us to pay it is barely operational.,
This app is so slow that my son cant focus and do the activities on his tablet. So frustrating!,
We love it! My kid is a little young to be doing it by herself but she very much enjoys it,
"Amazing! My littles, (2 and 5) love this and it is teaching them so much.",
Bad app. It auto renewed the following year. Hard to cancel subscription. Wasted hundreds,
"I love the app, that on tv, but I cannot install it on my phone which is easier and fun for my kid",
Disappointed!!!!! I can't afford a monthly subscription to anything!!!!!! NONE of y'all's commercials mention that you have to pay a single dime for your children to learn.,
Try to download the app after registering for 1 month free trial..but no luck. App stops downloading after 70%.,
I have problem with abc mouse app too. Until now she was doing her work until. And talk to somebody and they kept on giving me run around on this abc mouse.,
Wont let me cancel my subscription. My kid does not use this app and I would like to stop paying for it!,
App not working. Won't allow me to log in. It won't even allow me to ever my log in information to log in,
"Love this app, sadly it runs so sloooow loading the "" next activity"" and with a child who is very impatient thats kinda not a good thing!",
"I am not able to use the ABCmouse app on my phone, all I see is a yellow screen.",
This program is the best money ever spent for my granddaughter!! I highly recommend to everyone I can.,
cant even get on screen goes from full down to half then down to a small square when loggin in have proble on the computer also phone and tablet i got free trial a couple weeks ago so now i am paying for it and dont know why when cant use it will be cancelling,
I paid for the 6 month because it was cheaper. My grandson does not like ABCmouse. It does not have the interactive educational games he likes to play. How do I get my money back?,
Cannot log on to account on four separate devices. I'm sure they're going to say it's an update problem. I just want my money back.,
love the app. sometimes there is delay with the lessons and glitches but still worth every penny.,
My son loves this app. It's fun to play and educational activities doesn't really feel like school work.,
I can't even get past the sign in page. The buttons don't work to let the app know what gender my child is. As if that matters. What a disappointment.,
It freezes alllllll the time. Leaving me to uninstall reinstall jus so my daughter can keep her knowledge.,
"Love this app two kids on it and its just as good as being in a class, well worth it especially in these times",
great app except very slow. i feel my kid and i are constantly waiting for activities to load.,
I say 0 reviews the games would freeze so I deactivated my account with them but every time I get money that I need they go and steal it I'm not happy and if yall dont stop taking my money I will go to court,
"I got this for my son who will be two on the 11th of oct. And he loves all the different activities, and the books. As soon as we gave him the tablet to play it; he self taught hiself everything.",
Gets really glitchy. Also need a way to prevent ticket spending. Also ticket spending by siblings on shared accounts.,
We are trying to log in but cannot log in there is there is not a way to turn off the talkback when trying trying to get into the program,
Curriculum is great! App is garbage. Constantly freezes.,
not happy I need to spend $100 to have assessment done. I can't send information to her teacher. That's the whole reason I paid for the year.,
Me and my mom has not done computer school she said this is the perfect game to do school and I love this game too cuz I can change my character and my favorite is the hamster,
Autism 5 year old is doing much better in school. Makes learning fun.,
Freaking robbed i was forced to download this app to get discount on a game and said was free 7 day membership cancel anytime before then no charge bs charged emeditly 10.00 and now again 9.99 for idk what already canceled acc and still charging me,
This app is so fun you have ton of things to do I go for games math some science puzzles they never run out of stuff they just make their stuff,
"My daughter is in love with ABC mouse and it actually works, she's learning so much I love it",
Love it my son only a year old and he loves doing his ABC... hearing the songs and playing the puzzle games so thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è this app,

I am not happy with app. I have already canceled our subscription. Do you refund payments and if so when do you get it? Thanks,
ABC mouse is a very good learning game for kids I let my kids do it 5 minutes after they wake up in the morning,

This is a great app if you have kidos they will love to explore play and learn. I recamend to all,
I deleted so many apps just for space so my son can start learning just to not be able to install and open.,
The customer service is a nightmare. they don't warn you when they are taking money out of your account after a year. and even after you cancel they don't want to give you your money back. I will never use this company again.,

"Don't like it I was charged and the app won't even open to get my kids started üò° definitely want my money back or cancel the whole thing I wouldn't tell anyone about this it's a waist of time and your hard earned money not sure what the problem is but I just want my money back.......................................................... ,............... .................................................................................... ...............,.,..................",
It is too slow and we are never able to finish the assessment because it freezes.How can I unsubscribe?,
Excellent learning tool for young children. We love this app.,
We love this for my 3 year old. Hes learned so much and the grading tool.is an absolute must,
Unable to subscribe. Payment Authorization error is being shown continuously.,
I loved the idea of this app but I paid and could not use i emailed asking for help I didn't want my money back I wanted actual help telling me what to do to get in so I explained this and got an email back saying sorry we will refund you üòê,
This is the slowest most frustrating app ever. Remedial at best.,
"i didnt play it! you know why? i have to fricking pay to LEARN IN A FUN WAY! the girl in the ad said every kid should have it, BUT NOT EVERT KID BECAUSE THERE PARENTS WONT LET THEM PLAY CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY! And i dont have this in my school so NO EXUSES",
My 4yr old son loves it great app for young toddlers to learn and grow from,
We quit paying for this app because of its ties to Scientology. That aside it seems best suited for 3.5-5 year olds.,
I have had nothing but trouble trying to get connected. I even paid for the upgrade,
Granddaughter love abc mouse because it's so interactive with the different activities.,
Can't enter email or password to login. Doesn't work on my Samsung devices.,
It's been a real learning assistance to my 3yr when we started he's now 4 and doing well in kinder,
Before abcmouse we did Epic and both my kids HATED it! Couldnt get them to sit down and do school for longer than 10 minutes. This year we dropped Epic and started our own school. They literally argue now over who gets to do school first! They can sit there and do school all day! It's fun and even if they are just taking care of their pets their learning. Only thing I'd change is the games and puzzles section isnt working? Other than that its awesome!!!!,
"Very Rewarding,..My Twins finds it Amazing and Loves to learn to read and my 7yr.old daughter made a 100% on her math Test before she went on Christmas break!üëèüëèüòòüíïüòç‚ù§üôèüôèüëåüôåüíô",

"My child loves all the activitiez. It iseven helping her, to talk better",

My four-year-old daughter has thrived with this program and she loves it. I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEGE!,
"Very intriguing, and draws the student in. Encouraging the student to be involved.",
It won't let me download to my phone. It gets to 70% and just stops.,
My daughter absolutely loves this app and its been amazing for her learning experience,
Difficult to get started on smartphone when on the move for the child.,
The app doesn't work. Bought this in July and still won't work.,
This program is good but makes it hard to cancel your membership when you no longer need it.,
IT WILL NOT EVEN DOWNLOAD ON MY PHONE IT HAS BEEN STUCK ON 72% FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES AND MY WI-FI IS NOT BAD üò°üò°üò°,
I love this app because it helps babies or kids learn a lot even if it is with the games,
Can you please fix your servers? My mom paid for a year and my daughter can't even use it. This is really disappointing since my daughter loved using it.,
"once I paid the suscription, its not working!! Do not buy!! This is frustrating for your child",

My 7 year old daughter loves this app. Its helped her so much through 1rst grade!,
This was the best thing we could have done for our learner's they have fun learning.,
Will not load error message every time I open app and try setting up avatar.,
Excellent resource for the kids to practice learning objectives!,
I had downloaded the app and still have not been able to actually get Into it to even try it.,
I have seen the commercials and it is helping the little ones and my daughter loves it,
Why the hell would you frequently send popup ads on an app that three year olds play on? Morons.,
"Terrible, paid money for an app that didn't work and I can't cancel. Scam",
i downloaded the app twicw still a small screen i cant do anything on not a good app it DOES NOT WORK on chromebook,

I love it but it lags alot of the time. Even after updating.,
Kids are really excited about learning get and earning points.,
App not working on latest Android. It does not even let me login. OnePlus 8t.,
Hands down best learning program. I'm very impressed with it!,
Have been a customer on and off for nearly ten years. All my kids gained something different from it.,
This is such a good app I downloaded it in 2013 and now I'm getting a adventure Academy keep it up,
Its awesome it helps kids learn like the two shows on Netflix numberblocks and alphablocks,
Way too slow and kind of boring maybe the latter is different for an older child but definitely not for my pre k toddker,
App consistently hangs and need to be close and reopened to work again.,
If you have Android tablet it is horrible. I purchased ABC Mouse and not able to use it!!!!,
It really helps them engage in learning and want to learn.,

Very easy to use & understand. Good program.,
Just downloaded the app. It does not work on my son's android tablet nor on my Samsung galaxy Note 8 phone.,
"Helps kids learn Better and it's,experience for young kids ready for school.",

I love learning and I love ABCmouse because it's the best app I could ever have on my tablet,
App is pretty good teachers should use this app and if you buy it have fun whith this app I tried to play on my iPad and it was cool,
Easy to use quality videos and variety in materials age appropriate,
Its slow! Which makes it frustrating to use.,
My daughter is two she loves it but cant seen to keep her focused on it for to long yet,
Kids love to learn with this app. They have fun and learn at the same time. What is better than that.,
Abc mouse was ok but it didnt let me in. I have to add a email and a address. That was nonsense. thats why i give this review a 2 star rating.,
"I absolutely love it, It makes learning more fun. My kids enjoyed it",
I hated it i hated the ads and its glicht y i dont like it its interumpting my game-not this poop thingy- just dont install it,
If ABC mouse really cared about kids learning they wouldn't charge money for them to learn so learning is important only if u pay them,
My 3 year old is so captivated with learning. He thinks it's a game!,
Terrible. App won't even load and crashes each time,
This is so great my daughter is learning more and more she only 4 thanks ABC MOUSE!!üòÉ,

This has been a huge help with schools closed my son has loves the fun work and i love that hes learning,
"app stopped working, and can not intsall it on my phone anymore.",
Try to cancel subscription but it wont let me unless i download the app and my phone wont let me download the app...is there any other way to cancel the subscription????,
App does not work....paid $59.95 for the year and the app does not open. üò°,
$19 a month can't complain can have up to 4 kids on app really good if you can get your kids to stick to it and not go running to YouTube when they see you not looking,
"Not compatible with older devices, which is what we give our children to play with.",
This is the 3rd time unistalling and istalling app paid yr subsription it doesnt work at all,
I had to wait for few minutes to get in the app like the loading screen takes forever,
l love this app. So much to choose from for them to learn from. Great tool for any kid.,
Could not get the app loaded so I am going to cancel the subscription.,
I am paying for this subscription and cannot get the app to load. Please fix it.,
My 5 year old loves this program! He asks for it inxtead of YouTube which is a miracle in itself. We have been working on his name for over a year and he is now confident in spelling/writing it. ABC mouse has been a great investment in his education.,
This is the best game for me.I learn math art games really fun u guys should play this!,
"This app is so Fun it's good for children it's reading , math, science .",
Love love love my kid looks forward to this game and learns a lot!,

"My kids love and beg to play this app, even the learning path!!! 5 stars!!!",
This app wants credit card right away. No thanks. Money hungry app that dont care about kids with no money,
This app is horrible. I can't even get into it. It will not load much less open,
Can't log in on galaxy s21 ultra. It will not allow me to type in any of the fields.,
Such a scam. I have requested multiple times for my account to be cancelled.,
Great teaching tool. My son loves it and it keeps him engaged.,
abc mouse classroom live is great. my 5 year old grandson loves miss lauren. please dont get rid of her. the switching of the teachers upsets him (ie switching miss lauren with miss melanie ) it would be different if he started with melanie but with the covid time its stressful enough without the change causing more. i think students should be given a choice. He started with lauren and he is afraid she is gonna be fired and he really is upset about that.,
Unable to sign in after just signing up. How do you cancel if you cannot sign in??!,
"My 4 year old daughter loves this app, she learns so much from it everyday!",
takes too long to get into app. It is very SLOW!!!!!!,
Why can't i go pass the payment plan trying to get into the parent app and nothing pressing continue and it's not loading,
"I love it because my 3 year old daughter loves it. I hear, ‚Äú mommy I wanna do my school work please.‚Äù Thank you ABCMouse.",
Slow it doesn't even load anything or if it pads it's the very slowest.,
Loved it but now my grandson is 12years old he now he said the app is for baby you need one for older KIDS please help loved it for about 4 years,
"Says top #3 free app, but you have to be a paid subscriber to use. Cant bypass it",
Liked it until tonight. The parent section where it says how long your kid has spent on each topic is no longer working. Too expensive for an app that doesnt work perfectly,
i dont know whats happening after the big fix i cant access it anymore its just loading forever,
My child learns a lot from ABC mouse and it improves her grade and makes her smarter,
Stuck after the intro video. App is not advancing,
And mouse have songs videos reading and math books and games calendar and the leading path and the classroom And stuff and everything,
Wish it had more comprehending for speech delay and more of a math games for the right age group,
my kids rarely used this app and I have canceled it a few times now but am still charged every month.,
Scam. There is no free trial. Requires a $55 payment before any access is granted.,
I wish I could get this app but I bought a Google play card to pay and I can't I have to use my visa and I don't want to use my visa I don't want my son's to have my visa saved on his tablet I want to buy pre paid cards can you fix that,
"I Hate This app, it's Sooo Horrible, Like One I Was Little I Want to install The app Because I Love it But it Says ‚ú®Try it For 30 Days Free Child‚ú® But I Didn't Like That So I Unistall and install and install it again But it Said it again and I Thought My Big Sister Can Help But She Doesn't Know How to Fix The Problem and I Was Like WHAT THE FLIPüò°!?!?!?!?!? and My Sister Was Like LoLüòè. and I Was Like Soo angry and Can You Fix abc Mouseü§î?",
Great love it just wish it was a little bit more restricted to staying on track,
I have been charged and had to cancel multiple times with them.,
My kids love this app there's no adds everything is educational if you don't have it you got to get it,
Really helps make learning fun. Keeps my kids motivated.,
"A fun , and learning app !! Though I get to many ads about it ;).",
works good and definitely a great learning tool for your kids,
Canceled and I still got charged monthly. Plus the yearly charge.,
My daughter loves the app and learning that she begs me for this app...definitely will recommend this app for everyone .amazing app,
"installed app , it would not enlarge so i could only see half of the screen so i was unable to use it",
Great learning tool! Wonderful supplement to what we teach our child daily.,
i can't even get half the screen to pull up. and i have to pay for that? it freezes and won't let me do anything.,
This app is really good it helps you learn and have fun at the same time. Hope you enjoy it.,
Descriptive advertising. only things you can do free is watch their annoying video,
Can't recommend an app when you make it this hard to cancel the subscription,
For a free trial why do you need my credit card. When the 30 days are up give me the option to buy it. Thanks for nothing. Should be illegal to do that.,
I gave ABC a 3 because it didn't hold my granddaughter attention some app's did open and some did not work thanks,
Best app ever my 3 year old can read and add i thought it was really werid but this is realy great,
Doesnt load past yellow mouse screen and difficult too unsubscribe on trial...not happy very dissapointed,
"My daughter is a very smart child,and fast learner she loves ABC mouse",
This app is so good for learning it teaches kids a lot of great stuff,
I love this app for my kids they are having so much fun and learning at the same time!,
My daughter has not been able play one game since downloading yesterday. App keeps shutting down.,
Took my money but wont install. Removed apps to make space and cant get a refund without the app,
It not downloading for okay üòî and it's too much mb can you cut it down for me on my Amazon tablet or on the phone can you cut down the mb please üòÅ,
Haves been the amazing thing my son has he has picked up on alot of words and everything,
"fantastic app, highly recommend this app and abc mouse have added 1500 activities for year 2. my boys love the app",
I rate this app 5 stars because I heard that it helps with your learning and your mind think more.,
The app fine it's pretty easy use but sometimes the game stops i think it might a glitch,
love this game but i think it colud go a little herir on the geraid level becouse it needs a update a BIG one to but overall i LOVE the game #asdfghjkl,
i feel like it would be great only if it would load faster and not lag so much,
Screen is distorted. Will not let me sign in despite reboot of the app,
My son loves this app it keeps his attention and he doesn't realize he's learning!!,
This is really engaging informative and full of fun for kids.,
"Every time I I try to load my learning path, the App crashes..",
So hard to cancel. Still charges you afterwards. Not worth the investment.,
Kids love it. My kids have been playing non stop since they got it and love it.,
Love this app. My kids love it because the learning is made fun for them,
It's so fun to play with are hamsters and pet park pets.The games are so fun.,
"you have to pay and i just want to teach my kids without paying money. sorry to say this abc mouse, but you should change to were you dont have to pay.",
Completely disappointed in this company. I had called and emailed and not one person got back with me on my questions. I will not be recommending this to anybody. Also if I could I wouldn't even give it 1 star.,
ABCmouse is amaizing it has taught my 4years old daughter alot and she loves it!,
Love this app my 5 year old does really well with this! would definitely recommend.,
I can't download the app and cancellation my subscription so I could stop getting billed,
I am trying to download the app and it won't even let me download the only reason I am trying to download it right now is to cancel my subscription because it will not let me do it online and I would see if I can't do it through here I need somebody to email me and help me out with this situation my daughter's father already has this app on his phone for her so there's no need for me to have it as well. And there is already a $1 hold on my account that I would like taking off as well as my subsc,
Ok stop showing ur add I was playing game and I was getting this free at to get free gems and you keep popping up your little ad and i DONT WANNA INSTALL IT,
This app is amazing abc mouse helps me learn new or old stuff it's like real school whoever made abc mouse this helps me learn,
This game helps me learn new things and get ready for my 4th grade I love this game so nice and funüòä‚ù§üòáüëí,
Not a reliable app they make it hard dot cancel service app does not work well kid is not happy,
"Keep the kids busy, leaning, and having fun.",
It doesn't work half the time and I feel like spend 13 bucks a month on something my child can barely use is pointless .,
Excellent learning app. My kids love it üòÄ üòç They love story time.,
I think this app should be free for kids trying to learn why pay for this... if it was free you would get more people downloading it... if would be a very popular app,
The app shuts down. I can't even use it. I want a refund for my yearly fee,
app has to constantly be restarted. thinking about canceling my subscription,
I can not get it to load past the get started screen i registerd and everthing payed for it and can not even use it,
Keeps on freezing and after 2 days it didn't open at all,
I like this at 5 stars because it's a great learning app and I'm literally 9 years old and I still play this game.üòÄüòÄüòÄ,
Learning activities are no longer loading. My son cannot nove forward with the activities,
im very upset with this app i have been charged many times in the same month for 3.95 and 9.95 and dont know y i wouldnt recommened this app to anyone,
"App doesn't work, its horrible freezes all the time",
I just love how it teaches too help kids to learn.,
"Awesome app, keeps my toddler engaged and makes learning fun.",
13$ A MONTH!!! I dont leave reviews often but I also dont like being duped into downloading something that appears free when it's 13$ A MONTH. For the kids right ABC RATS,
Amazing learning resource. My 3 yr old son loves it.,
My child loves this and I am really impressed with the content for such a low price.,
They do that predatory thing where they get your credit card number then charge you after your free month without asking whether you want it or not.,
Awesome games and activities. It makes learning fun!!!,
I love the abcmouse experience but I do not like the fact that it freezes alot,
This is amazing and my daughter loves it! She is Kindergarten Ready!,
Can't use the app anymore. It freezes all the time. üòê,

It's really expensive and does it load on my phone or my laptop when I connect it to it up grade,
i keep trying to download it to my phone and once its done it doesnt download i have to keep redoing it and it won't,
This is such a great app! It is a good source to have during this stay at home period.,
When I scroll down for many games it didn't rain out there are so many I could play from ABC mouse,
my boy just loves earning the tickets and it really is teaching him fast so ii 10 star also for the variety,
We love this app. This is a fun way for the kids to apply what they are learning. Thank you.,
The kids find it engaging and it's also educational.,
Great. My son enjoys the songs and colorful videos.,

My 3 year old gets bored fast. It doesn't keep his interest.,

That you have to pay for having your child learn before they start school. Spend money on them in school I don't think that you should have to spend it outside of school.,

Its very educacional and entertaining my boys love IT they say its fun,
So abc mouse wasnt working very well for my kids tablet so i deleted it and it wont let me cancle my subscription so i keep getting chaged for it,
"I had cancelled my subscription but it still charges, plus cant even use app.",
Just joined and the experience is bad. Shows am offline yet I have internet. I feel conned.,
"Buggy even on a good day. Also, everyone knows you can make tons of money when the kids are forced to be out of school. But don't accept more subscriptions than your servers can support.",
screen auto split and shrunk. impossible to work on,
This has help my two year old identify all her letters.also my one year old knows all his alphabets...so wonderful üòä,
give it five stars because it works on my at school because I'm only 7 but it works at my school but I don't want this one how in the world do you make it like it's at and how I see it's in the freaking commercials,
I think its great that ABC mouse has offered this service free for children due to the corana virus situation . I think its ridiculous that some people are complaining that its lagging a bit lately when obviously alot of kids are using it due to being stuck at home all day . thank you for putting our childrens health over the mighty dollar ... I wish more companies followed your lead,
Totally disapointed in this app i feel scamed. Why after putting in all my infomation I cant use the app and it only asking for my info over and over again? I want out !!!!!,
I used to use it everyday but then I stopped using it it got boring and we also had to pay for it so it was a waste of money üí∞üí∏ü§¨üá∏üá¶,

"It goes very slow, tried on my phone,tablet and same",

Can't even log in to the app. Paid subscription,

this is very misleading. its not free. its free to download but not to play. whats the point in adding it to the free if its not free. very stupid and misleading,
The app is nice but too slow to load ...it says error.,
I paid for a supcsription and proceed to download...about 30 minutes later it still downloading. My 3 yr old grand is waiting. 2 thumbs down.,
I hate this my daughter hates this like I don't know what to do because she said I don't want to go on ABCmouse every time I say it and for the first time he tried it she said she doesn't want to do it either so I'm very disappointed in this they should take away this app no one should be on this,
Great progress with my child. Worth every penny!,
Very slow running app..not worth 60 bucks..neva again,
My son can't stop talking about it. He has fun and it's easy to use.,

My Son is soooo into this app! I've even learned a few things or two from the lessons... M.E.,
"He loves doing his letters. I love when he bring his screen and says ""Granny I need to learn""",
I somehow got it to unfreeze because I clear cache it!!!,
With whatever this new update is its a hit or miss for the app to work.,
It's a little boring and it takes too long to load everything,
its allready making her learn to be able to read anyway I like it,
"I just signed up, it takes a long time to load from one thing to a another....",
This app is amazing! I'm ten years old and I still enjoy it. I say download the app.,

It's stupid because you only make it to where kids can play it till they are 8and just for your child to learn you have to pay for that is so stupid!,
Fix your app this is ridiculous for a messing up so much for a paid app do something about it or continue to lose customers üò†üò°,

I PAIDED FOR THIS PROGRAM AND IT DOESNT WORK IT IS STOCK ON THE MAIN PAGE WHERE YOU SIGN UP AND PAY IT WONT EVEN MOVE OFF THAT PAGE,
I've never been a member. How do you set up a new account. When I install the app all it has is the members login . Please How do I fix this.,

Is there ABCmouse I thought there was supposed to be 7 but there's not I don't see him nowhere,
Why do they claim they are #2 free app when they allow a free 30 day trial and then chg $10 month after they get your child hooked on it. They aren't free. Boo to the people behind this big lie!!! It's one thing to chg when you're honest up front but to lie & claim they're free. Shame on them.,

It talks forever to log Into and you have to pay and I paid and it tuk a extra ¬£5 out my account,

Stoo making people pay to educate children. Kids are vital and learning should not be a privilege. You can get paid through ads or something else.

Be better to our future generations.,

Do Not give your bank info. ABCrat continued charging after I canceled my account twice! For months this happened & of course I can not stop them through my bank nor can I erase my bank info from abcüêÄ app & website. Also the charge was increased to $14.99 after i canceled the first time. And my child didn't enjoy it. I will edit this review if customer service refunds all of my taken money. You can see the account was not used after the trial period except to cancel and cancel....,
I love it and it's wonderful thank you ABC mouse for this amazing opportunity,

Muy buena la allicacikn lastima que se tiene que pagar para entrar entrar en los niveles la educacion deveria ser lo principal para ls ni≈àos perk entie do que las mejoras y actualizaciones son caras deberja ser abajo costo para que lo principalsea la educacion de los ni√±os del futuro,
"My grandson has really taken off with this app. He is excited to learn on it. That being said, I had a school coffee for 60 days free and I'm glad it's free because it is lagging bad. Now I'm trying to add my 3rd child on it and it won't even load. I do understand that because of the ""free"" time added that there are more users out there so it may slow things down. Unfortunately, kids don't understand this. It's frustrating for them. My grandson is behind in kindergarten NEEDS this. Please fix.",
My two and four year olds both love Abc Mouse. My four year old is especially exicited and keeps telling me that she wants to get to level 4. She watches her progress by looking at the bus in the learning bath. Thank you Abc Mouse!,
"My daughter loves ABCmouse. I wish there was a way to bundle reading iq, mouse and adventure academy into one payment package. I have all three apps for my kids.",
Downloaded this app a few months before my son started kindergarten and I must say that it helped him a lot and ended up being ahead of his learning level.,
I'm changing my review. Customer service did a great job of resolving issue I was experiencing.,

"The constant log outs were annoying, but manageable. In the last few days however the games aren't being completed or advancing no matter how many times they are played. You complete a puzzle or listen to the song and it just freezes, it's not just that it won't give tickets (which irritates my toddler) it won't move on to the next game. We paid too much for this for it not to work, please fix it.",

What's the purpose of the app and can't even get a free trail to determine if you are interested in the program. Total failure with this app. No wonder they have 3.9 stars,

"The concept of the app is good, my biggest complaint is that every week, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app due to a glitch that causes it to fail to upload the content upon opening the app. It never makes it to the opening page of the last child that played on the app. This is very frustrating not only for my children, but for myself as well.",
"Was running choppy on my daughter's Dreamtab. Now it's just a frozen intro screen.... It's what she does school on, so unless you can optimize the app for what children are using for learning, this will be my rating...",

"We had originally signed up for ABC Mouse about 2 years ago, when my daughter was only 9 months old. She was able to push the buttons but not much more, that was my fault for signing up for it too early. Needless to say, we cancelled until just today. My little one was so excited to play!! The issue is, she had tickets from our prior subscription and was ecstatic to buy a frong with her tickets. We attempted to go to the Pet Park and it keeps freezing or just doesn't work. We're canceling!!",

We love abcmouse. But it is slow on android. always give the concept and content 5 üåü but now since new updates it's gotten way slower and freezing alot more. first load up is soo sloth slow that i watch the yellow screen like forever. please fix. great app. been around since forever. but since u wanted more new things like 1st grade stuff for example but which is great. very buggy.,
horrible won't even load! nice waste of money! and the company responding is a joke. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! DESERVED NO STARS!!!,
"3/16/2023 we had this app for years but when it came time to reup I didn't think it was really worth it anymore. It doesn't work without being home to have internet. I'm not a parent to let my kid sit on my phone. I'm using it for GPS driving! I decided since they had sale to maybe reup. I just installed it again. It it won't even let me log on. It tried sending me to a web page which always upsets me, but then I need to contact cust. Service instead of just fixing it. These ""new age problems""",
My granddaughter has learn a lot from ABC mouse.,

Perhaps our expectations were set too high that we could buy an app that replaced all the add supported apps out there. The main problem is that the app is painfully slow in every and all aspect. Launching takes time which perhaps would have been ok. But even inside the app everything comes to a halt. To teach the alphabet you would have different pictures but even going from an Apple to a Banan there is like a 5 second delay which is super frustrating. Already been in contact with the support team and apparently there is no plan to improve the app. Also note that if you don't have a very quick and stable broadband connection the app will not work. So forget using it during car/plane trips. There is some apps that could be downloaded for offline but not these are subpar. If they invested some money into the app maybe it could work better.,
"AWFUL APP THAT NEVER WORKS. We have 2 tablet and 3 brand new cell phones, ALL ofwhich crash when using this app. We have paid too me h money for this for this to be acceptable. FIX IT NOW.",
Could not get it to come up on my phone was told I had a 30 day free subcription. was just charged $9.99 or something and I wanna cancel it and I want my money back,
Literally will not open or work at all. Just freezes after I log in. I have uninstalled and reinstalled with no sucess.,
"Terrible app and terrible program. Horribly slow, hard to find information, app size is HUGE, all around terrible.",
This app is anoying to use and they heckel you when you try to cancel your subscription. They refused to refund me for a month even though my child didn't once touch the app and I cancled it at the begining of the month they had charged me for!!,
"I have paid for the subscription and was working fine but now I can't even click on the area to login when you open the app to put in your username and password. Ughhhh nothing happens when you click the box, an ok pops up but no keyboard",
I wanted this since I saw the commercial about ABC Mouse why don't you guys just make it free and I'm 8 and i still want to have it,
Not a good learning app and they way too much,
Used to be great. It's so slow. Nothing loads. I see a cancellation coming.,
Just have android w/internet. Downloaded but not activated.,
This game is great so make more learning please thank you!,
You can you can learn for babies and child's,
"Now my app is not working. Im not sure what it is, just gots in blanck",
I got this for my child and she loves!itüòòüòçüòòüòçüòòüòçüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòöüò±üòÜüòÜ,
Grandchildren love this app!,
Its a cool app for kids,
Super educational,
I love it,
Awesome,
Hehhd A,

Tilloswattyouthin,
Absolutely love this app for my daughter she loves to learn. This is the best app for her since she is one a waiting list to attend a Head Start Program. Due to her age and birth date she is not able to start Transitional Kindergarten until next year so for now this app is the best home school education she can get. Thank You ABC Mouseüíú,
"Outstanding app. My daughter has special needs and the customer service team has been great every time we need to back her up and redo lessons. The app is super engaging and she absolutely loves it. I used it for my older daughter who has no issues, and she excels in school today. ABC Mouse could very well be for everyone. No matter what the educational or learning need.",
"This is such a bum app it need something some people can not tell and it is 
bad coz im 10 and it is not what kids my age need to laern so what im 
sayying is please make this app better but making kids my age know what 
thay need to know! But it is a good app of kids say 3 to 8 but kids my age 
not so much... SO PLEASE UPDATE IT SO KIDS MY AGE CAN KNOW WHAT THAY NEED 
TO KNOW PLEASE... But like i said it is a good app for kids for 3 to 8 but 
not kids my age So please Update so kids my age can know what thay need to 
know!...üòä",
"This site is what made my daughter a straight a student. She's never gotten 
a B. I start her off at age 2 and the rest was history she started writing 
her name singing songs reading me stories. ABC mouse have me crying just 
writing my reviews this site is amazing. Here I am 3 years later adding my 
son now.",
"For a yearly fee you'd think the UI would be better. The UI is extremely clunky. Feels like its 10 years old. Also, my children are uninterested in the content. Make this more fun to use so I don't feel like I'm just wasting my money.",
"DO NOT BUY YEAR PACKAGE!!!! This stupid thing glitches all the time and now 
my son can't even move on in the learning path because we can't complete 
the activity with the software not working properly. Hey einsteins, make it 
to where parent password can over ride activities for when these stupid 
glitches occur so the children can continue on the learning path...not too 
difficult!!!",
"I actually do love the app and my two year old likes it and we enjoy our learning time together... HOWEVER!! read the terms of services. I pay money to ABC mouse because I don't want ads or inappropriate content like some other children's free apps have. ABC mouse does not do that however their agreement does say they collect and share cookies and info from your phone, browsing content and child's progress with third party providers. I'm anti govt regulation however I'm getting to a point where these companies are invading way too far into our devices privacy and collecting too much personal information that does not revolve around the direct use of the application. I don't mind if mouse is using data to assist my kid through lessons but they have no business collecting info off my phone. I'm ready for regulation to end practices like this.",
"Horrible costumer service. They could not even cancel my subscription I was 
having trouble with my I pad and said the only way I could cancel was 
through Apple .. which I could not contact due to my I pad not working. I 
just can't believe they could not cancel from there end. And I'm sure I 
won't get a refund when I finally get this resolved.",
"I thought it was great until it updated . Now my son can't do any of the 
rainbow traceables. thus he is stuck on level 5 of his learning path. Tried 
closing out as suggested but won't work. Not on either of our tablets or 
phones Can't use the the contact us section either .",
"It uses predatory practices of having you enter credit card information that will auto-bill when you sign up for the free trial, hoping you'll forget to cancel, and offering a hefty discount to trap you into a year subscription before you even start the trial! You can thankfully cancel through the app, but it takes going through 10 pages of ""yes I'm sure I want to cancel"" as they try to convince you not to. This is not a sign of an app that people WANT to keep using. As for the app itself, the buttons are way too small and there's so much on the page that it's hard to read. The back button is perfectly in the spot where my daughter holds the phone, so it's way too easy to press and leave the current activity and get lost in a menu somewhere. The ""puzzles"" automatically put the pieces in the right place if she so much as touches them, so I doubt she's actually learning anything. Every click of every button results in a 2-3 second load time, even in the menus! This was the first phone game I showed my daughter where she got so frustrated that she started yelling no and hitting my phone! Maybe it's good for older kids, but for preschoolers, hell no.",
"I have three grandaughters, and each girl has her own tablet. I have ABC 
Mouse set up on a different device for each child, with their own learning 
path and personal profile. The children would love to be able to open the 
application, and play the games, any time they wanted to...and they would, 
if I didn't have to log out of the kid safe mode and into ABC Mouse EVER 
SINGLE TIME my granddaughters want to play with this game... And if all 
three girls would actually show as ""users"" to play the games, and if the 
technical support team actually listened to my concerns instead of sending 
me blanket ""fix""e-mail that didn't come close to answering my questions and 
addressing my concerns, maybe I wouldn't hate this app so much...but as it 
is, ABC Mouse is a pain in the butt to use. Unless your kids are happy 
listening to the ABC Mouse advertisement over and over again, and if one 
child doesn't mind never having her name show up on the player list, and 
therefore never getting any ""tickets"" for her play time, then maybe ABC 
Mouse would be worth the rediculious price...but until somebody can take 
the time to address my concerns and help me to correct the problem, ABC 
Mouse sucks.",
"It's good but now that I switch phones I have the g7 n it won't let me in 
it I want my account canceled if I can't get in it",
My son loves this app. With all the game on his tablet this is the only he plays now and h e is 2yrs old and I usually don't write reviews.,
"Canceled long time ago and have been charged 71 bucks since. When we were 
using it my son loved it and if your kid find A it boring is probaly 
because your not putting the time in or they're always on fortnite",
"The games themselves can be spammed to completion by children who don't 
understand the lesson. Tickets can be earned by the children listening to 
stories. This app is all hype. Very dissapointing. They want the kids to 
like the app. So they make the app fun instead of challenging.",
"This app is ok but my main issue with it is the loading time. It's just way 
too slow for a little kid game. Also it's not user friendly it's too 
complicated for a small child.",
Simply awesome app. There is sooo much to do and my 3+ yr old just loves the activities. No complaints,
"This app doesnt work for Android. No one has contacted me back in trying to 
fix it. I pay monthly for it, but its worthless if it wont work for certain 
systems.",
"The app is great, when it works. It freezes a lot and takes a long time to 
load.",
"Excellent app for learning. Just needs some bugs and glitches fixed, some 
of the tracing activities don't allow you to trace the letters.",
For such a simple app it's laggy. My 3yo son is getting frustrated.,
Needs lots of fixs for starters its soooooo slow my child gets so frustrated she just rather not be on it. Bummer!,
"My daughter is having an issue with the game with the seal and feeding the 
fish. I've even tried to help her and you can't pick up the fish and feed 
it to the seal. Is there a trick I am missing or a way to bypass this? She 
can't move on if she can't feed the seal.",
I find some of the activities to be a little young for the age group what other activities are a little too old for the age group. I would like the activities and levels to be easier to change according to what I see he needs. All together though it is a very good app and I enjoy using it with him. He's learning quite a bit and I see a lot of progress.,
i clicked in the link you sent me and encountered the same error. i cant even contact your support team. u need to cancel it today otherwise i will be charged for the monthly fee. please send me an email directly so i can send you a screen shot.,
Its a good app my child loves it but it freezes alot whether its on the phone or tablet.,
I love material but there are constant glitches in the software. Lessons are interrupted daily.,
"I want to give it a 5 star but the construction counting on one of the 
levels doesn't work. It will not allow my child to move the numbers to the 
cranes. Therefore she cannot finish a lesson. Please fix this and I will 
revise my rating. Thank you",
"I have a paid subscription to this app for years. I've used it on my 
laptop, tablets, and galaxys s5 and s7. I bought an LG g7 this week. Every 
time I try to open the app now with my new phone the app blinks open and 
closes. Why is this happening. Customer service responded via Emil telling 
Mr to do things I have already tried and then sent a survey. The problem I 
still not fixed.",
"I cancelled my subscription over 2 months ago and im still being charged $14 a month. Thats called STEALING abc, should do a lesson on stealing. Absolute BS. Definitely not worth it.",
"This is the worst app I have ever used! It freezes daily and doesn't save 
my kids' progress. Total waste of money!",
"Menus and navigation too complicated for a toddler or 4 and under. Needs improving not worth the money for early learning. App is not compatible with Android 4.2 systems and below. Load time is too long,",
"My daughter was trying to do the traceable on her level and it would work 
on her tablet. Very annoyed especially when you have to pay for the service.",
"Does not open on the LG G7, immediately closes. But works on my s8 plus. Won't renew membership if this isn't fixed asap!",
You can't play without a subscription. Deleted it.,
Suks smams people suks sighn up for the free trail an get scamed,
My 3 yr. Old grandson loves it .once he gets started he hates to stop . There is so much for him to explore .,
Stopped working on G7. Doesn't pass loading screen,
My grandson cant seem to get enough. He looks forward to it each day and loves to learn new stuff,
"Kinda hard to know if its useful, educational, or appropriate for anyone let alone my toddler, if I can't even use it bc you have to buy it. This is not free, and I am incredibly disappointed! !",
"It needs me to pay to sign up. I am not an adult and im trying to help my 
little bro learn, and i need to pay!!! I dont have any credit cards!",
Very slow. I would NOT recommend this app.,
Some lessons are frozen and will not work,
Love it! My granddaughter learned so much using this app. Thank You ! Best app. ever,
My daughter loves it and has learned so much in a short time.,
"This is so good it help my daughter so and is so fun she love's it thank 
you ABC mouse",
"This is the best app ever my son is going to kindergarten and he loves 
learning new things",
"I absolutely love it! My daughter has got a lot better at math and 
reading!!!",
I hate it you need to buy things,
My kids love ABC mouse. It's easy to use and fun at the same time.,
Day . Hi Grammy this is munchies,
Absolutely LOVE it. My 7 year old is thriving thanks to God and this app.,
"Looks like a awesome learning adventure, thank you so much",
"Excellent & entertaining way to get kids excited about learning! AbcMouse 
is worth every penny!",
This will my youngest son Dakota to learn so thank you,
"I got this for my son when he was two, and he loves it!!",
Can't get past the loading menu to use the app.,
I have recommended it to several other parents,
It's amazing my 2 year old love the app,
Not working on our android and even on our PC..,
Nice Interactive Learning app very helpful,
Won't even open. Paid for a full year.,
My daughter didn't seem to gain anything from this program,
Its a great learning app for the varying ages of my kids.,
A thought it would be easier for a 3 year old,
Got the free trial and it said i would not be charged till the month was over and it charged my card,
"Love it , so helpful for my kiddo,",
My three year old loves it!,
Since i home school my kids this is great learning for my kids,
My child is not entrige as in the commercial,
Downloaded the app and it wouldnt even open,
My boys enjoy it very much,
"Complete scam!!! Was roped into subscribing to this in relation to a drone 
give away. DON'T FALL FOR IT!!!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP!!!!!",
My child didn't like it at all,
It won't lode. All I get is the yellow page with the mouse...,
My four year old Love's playing on this app,
My son loves it!,
Best learning app.,
My. Son loves it,
Required creation of online account,
Great for both of my granddaughters,
My daughter loves this app,
the kids love it.,
It is bad,
"I like the app but the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the sound 
isn't working. I have the settings with the sound on, but there's stil no 
sound.",
fullllllll oof happines,
GreatüíØ,
It is a great app,
Get learning tool,
Cool Stuff,
I love it I love it I love it,
helped my child tremendously!!!!,
We love it love it,
Awesome,
it is good,
Love it,
Fun,
Beautiful,
Love it,
Love it,
Love it,
Great,
I paid for an app that does NOT even open! It keeps force closing. I've tried restarting my phone and uninstalling and re installing. Nothing works. Can someone help me from the company please.,
Wouldn't open,
I don't it,
Paid app,
I like it,
üëç,
"My only concern that the trading game isn't working. We uninstalled and 
reinstalled couple of times but no luck, I can't find troubleshooting tab 
so my son is not happy not being able to practice writing. Beside that 
everything is great. My son is very happy to use the app and he is learning 
so much, plus it help they use it at his school too",
"Once you unsubscribe here, you won't be able to use the app even if you've paid an entire year, even when they say you can use the app for the entire year of your subscription. I unsubscribed because it runs so slow, it demands faster internet connection, and probably bigger memory. Not advisable for third world countries like the Philippines, when they should be considering the country as a big market of their product. Everybody here speaks English.",
"The app is great but I don't know what the problem is with theater add 
books not always working. My son loves to watch the music videos and they 
haven't been working. I don't know that I'll be paying for this if this 
continues. It's sad to have a sad kid who hopes to watch these videos or 
books at bedtime and can't. He can't even pass the current level just 
because videos aren't playing. This is a 5 star app but with this issue 
it's not. It's a big problem when you can't move forward.",
"This app is free to download but as soon as you open it you have to enter 
your credit card info in order to do any of the activities. I unistalled it 
immediately. It is deceptive. They should just put the price on the app so 
people know that they will have to pay for it BEFORE they install it.",
"Some people say it's boring, but the truth is you have to be involved with 
it as much as your children. Kids in turn will feel more enthusiastic to 
open the app if they have a parent's to sit on and share the content with, 
rather being left to their devices to do this thing alone. Then again I 
suppose it all depends on the child as well. My Grand daughters loves it, 
because they can always go to father and do the games with him and he's 
just as enthused to sit with them and play... it becomes a game to all of 
them.",
"It does not work well on my kids iPads but on my phone it is fine. My 6 
year loves it. My 2 year is not allowed just yet.",
"My kids wake me up to play this hahaha. I don't mind as much because they 
are learning.",
"Have a paid subscription and the app doesn't work. My child hasn't even 
been able to use it. HUGE waste of money. No customer support either with 
this issue either. I will not be renewing.",
"hard to navigate for my almost 4 year old. it doesnt catch his interest and 
doesnt seem like theres much to do that he likes on it.",
My son is 3 1/2 and the games don't seem to hold his interest or teach him anything..,
"The app needs a built in screen lock. So your kid can't exit or back out of 
anything right in the middle of it cause they hit the home or back button. 
Our son is handsy and wants to hold the tablet. But keeps accidentally 
pressing the back or home button. Uninstalling and canceling untill added.",
"I dont understand why this app wont load. I have a subscription and 
everything and now im getting nothing out of it for my son because the app 
wont even work. I have updated it as well and it is not working.",
"It's an amazing app. My daughter will be in first grade by August but she 
reads every words without my help.",
"ABC Mouse makes it extremely difficult to end membership. I'm at that point 
where I'm calling my bank to stop payments. We do not use it. My child is 
bored with it. I've tried to cancel subscription but it's impossible.",
"Will not work. I have uninstalled and installed 6 times now and still 
cannot get this app to work. Waste of time and money. I will look for 
something better and cancel my membership.",
"This is the best app for children and parents that I have ever in my entire 
36 years ever seen thank you abcmouse. Com",
"The app itself was great, cancelling and then leaving the country only to 
find upon return that they continued to charge us for months was not!",
"Not bad. Not super great. It loads super slow at times. Would have to go 
back and replay it! Can't even move forward. Even my kid is annoyed and 
frustrated with it.",
"My daughter loves this app and has honestly learned a lot. It's amazing 
watching her learn and have fun at the same time!",
"I love how interactive this app is and how my daughter takes the initiative 
to request to get on the app daily. She absolutely loves ABC mouse.",
"My granddaughter has really learned a lot. Thank you for this educational 
program. I recommend it to anyone that has little ones.",
"The game deeply saddened me such a beautiful story line and that rat Oof Hit me right at home I never had a rat but is this game family friendly pg clean? HmmMM edit: nm lmao, the game writers said ""100% family friendly""",
"This is one of the best apps i have found and the assessments are great. 
Only app on my sons tablet now",
"I highly recommend this app so that children can still use abc mouse while 
on the go. I would give it a 5/5 but because sometimes the graphics glitch 
in both the website and in the app I have given this app a 4/5.",
It lags too much on any device. Sometimes the game doesn't work.,
Very glitchy and I have to be tapping on a link more than twice.,
did not keep my kids engaged i guess is the best way to discribe it.,
My kids love playing. It a fun way to learn and they dont even realize.,
"Works ok most of the time. Sometimes can't connect. Sometimes it says I 
played a video when I didn't. Work ok on android phone touch screen. But 
has issues with android box using a mini wireless mouse",
"My granddaughters love this game... variety of activities always keeps them 
engaged. System of rewards is great.",
"Thank you for this app... Its helping my daughter whos 3yrs old advance for 
Kengarden.",
"I can't find the literacy section? My daughter is 3 yr old and she really 
likes it. She is already advanced past where she is and I don't know how to 
advance the level.",
So why do I have to buy every thing make it free for once,
I hate it it is so boring. We dislike. It very much,
Phone app horrible. Takes wayyyy too long to load lessons.,
So slow loading child loses interest before it fully loads.,
App is force closing not able to use on LG g7,
"abcmouse has a lot of activities for younger children. I wish they would 
add content for older children on a higher level! We love that the price is 
good for 3 kids in a family!!",
"Love it! My daughter has grown so much and really impressed me with her 
learning ability with the curriculum.",
"Great learning app. 4 stars because it loads slow and freezes from time to 
time.",
"I love love love it. It has helped my soon to be kindergartner so much. 
Thank you ABC Mouse.",
I love this for my daughter! She's delayed speech and helps a lot!,
Garbage app. Would not let my kids use it.,
"Literally downloaded the app to cancel the subscription, especially because 
I was charged a dollar for the free month. But no the parent controls do 
not work on the computer, phone web, nor app. DELETE MY ACCOUNT!!",
"This app is for my son. He absolutely loves it. He learns so much while he 
explores.",
It a great app. My little one loves it n hes learned so much by useing it,
"pj masks Romeo kidnaps night ninja Luna girl attacks owlette gekko and 
catboy",
I hate it it would not let me play,
It keeps kicking me out of the app hate it,
"I absolutely love this app it's the best learning app for kids my son loves 
using this app and has helped make learning fun and keeps teaching him 
things he needs to know and get him ready to start school",
"I have a question, can my 15 month old start using this? I had it for my 4 
year old and he starting reading and writing on his own in the same day. I 
love ABC Mouse :)",
I am 8 and I still play the game!üòÇ,
My 3 year old love it. My 18 month old enjoys listening to the books.,
Won't work on fire 8 tablets,
I think that it really helps kids learn and it gets them prepared for school,
I use printable section alot.,
T I Think It Is A Really Great App,
Keeps crashing. I paid for the membership.,
This app has been helping my son to do well in school.,
I love this more than that my baby can read or whatever it is,
Is amazing for my sis she's 4 and learning alot,
The best for a kid to get ready for kindergarten,
"It look cool my friend jade this for 8 years and the new the smartest boy 
in my class",
Wonderful. My 3 grandkids love and learn!,
Can't really call it free education app when it costs $10 a month.,
I love it and so does my kids,
This is a great head start when parents don't know where to start.,
I'm just trying to find my place.,
My son has loved it. It's easy to use and fun.,
I think this app is great and it makes Kids learn,
Excellent app just need to be more exciting for kids,

"Update: I cancelled yearly subscription so I won't get charged, like 
thousands of other people;even though they cancelled their subscription. 
Suppose to renew in April 25,2019. Guess what, there is no option to remove 
credit card from account. Going to call Citi to send me card with new 
number. Why no option to delete credit card? Wish I had read about this 
scam before paying for whole year. Please do your homework and there are 
tons of better option out there. I happily donated to few free apps to 
support the developers because my son was using and learning from those 
apps. Old: Please fix it. App keeps crashing on kindle fire when loading 
since last update. If you have a policy of no refunds, then provide us 
working app.I didn't pay for full year to get an app that my child can't 
use. Paid till April 25,2019. Used only for few weeks. Looks like they 
don't care about fixing ,only care about money getting deposited into 
account.",
"This is awesome. My son is catching on so fast while having fun. This year 
will be his first year of school and I believe he will be ready or ahead of 
the game with the help of ABC Mouse!! Please try this if your child is 
starting school for the first time or struggling in any areas. You will be 
so surprised at how quickly they catch on with this app.",
"It's a good idea but the software is very glitchy on both the app and 
website no matter what browser you are using. I used this service for 2 
years and when I paid to renew my account that said my account wasn't 
active anymore. Which was the reason why I was contacting them. I paid for 
a service that I wasn't able to use. Instead of fixing the problem they 
refunded my money. Very poor customer service. Plus the content is so 
repetitive my son would lose interest. There are way better programs and 
services out there. Don't waste your time with ABCmouse.",
"Tienen un horrible customer service. Te cobran all minuto pero nadie te 
contesta cuando los llamas o escribes.",
"My kids love abc mouse. Set it up on computer for them and it worked great 
til the new update was added. Just gets stuck on that page. Can't hit ok or 
anything. I pay for this app and am very disappointed. Before update, no 
problems",
"App is broken. Trying to sign my daughter up and it shows a broken screen. 
Top half is black and gotten you can see the continue botton",
"Amazing learning app for my four year old daughter it's fun filled games 
that help them learn at the same time it's absolutely great",
"My 3 year old daughter absolutely loves abc mouse. She has learned so much 
in the few months that she has been on it.",
"Do not get this app unless you want to spend hours upon hours trying to 
cancel your account. What a scam.... I cancelled this previously and months 
later it just starts billing me again.",
"Great app just runs a little slow. My 2 year old loves this app and is 
learning so much",
"My daughter loves this app. Freezes at times but mostly works well. The 
activities are age appropriate and she is loving learning. Tha k you 
whoever came up with this app",
"My child was on the app not even 5 minutes and made my device very hot to 
the point it shut right off and drained my battery. Also can't download on 
my child's tablet which I would like since my phone had no space and the 
app takes the rest up.",
"This app is useless!! It continues to freeze while I'm setting up my son's 
profile. I paid for the subscription and am unable to use it because this 
app is awful!!!!",
"I have two grandson's and they love it. I use this a lot more during the 
summer and it helps them for the following year to come. Thank you so much 
ABCMouse for being the extra teacher for my two little ones. Lisa",
"It looks like fun. Lots of great things to buy on this site, th a,I you!",
"My grandkids love ABC Mouse. I even bought them tablets with just this app 
loaded! Hours of learning entertainment.",
Have a son with neurological problems has helped him tremendously,
This app is terrible 60$ out the window üò°,
"It's boring for my 5 year old. It's not really a learning app. It's more 
for fun.",
"Tried to cancel for 2 month and they never let me. Did it from mobile phone 
to register but to cancel sent me to website then asked me to download the 
app and like that continuously",
my 2 yr old and 5 yr old niece loves it!! and I love that they are learning.,
Very educative and my children love it. Also self-explanatory.,
"It is a good app but it is more for a computer instead of a phone but that 
is not the apps fault",
Best app ever! My kids love it and they are actually learning!,
This is for my baby cousin that is 2 years old and she loves it,
Great app. Both my girls love playing it.,
I think it is really fun and I'm 9 years old.,
It helps my son a lot in,
It's Good for my child Kayla,
U have to pay for it how does that help are kids,
Love it it is perfect help for home school.,
It's good for do kids,
my granddaughter asks to play it all the time!,
The app won't even open.,
"Can't review an app I can't use because it won't let me play without credit 
card information.",
Doesn't get past opening screen on my lg g7,
My kids LOVED the app!,
i been trying to get this app for my son for like 6 months now but it want let me get it,
I love it my kids love it!,
My kid loves abc mouse ü§óü§óüòéüòÅ,
Fun learning app!!,

It's fun,
Great educational app,
Cool Awesome l,
I LOVE it,
Horible,
Great,
Love it,
Love it,
Love it,
Kids like it.,
Hopefully it's real.,
This is for baby,
"My son, Kahikini has learned so much. His getting ready for kindergarten. 
So thank you.",
"The features and tools in this app are great, useful and its awesome to see 
what my child has been learning. however the app has glitches quite often, 
so does the website. It makes it frustrating to use if you have to work out 
bugs all the time",
"My daughter loves it and I can tell she has learned alot and continues to 
learn more.",
"The app just doesn't work. I've tried several times to create a profile on 
the app for my child and can't. I was able to do it computer, but we wanted 
to use the app on his tablet.",
Worth the money. It's learning in a fun way that my son loves to play.,
They give my kid all the answers how is he supposed to learn anything,
Hate!!!,
I hate it,
Hi this is the best,
"The app is sp incredibly glitchy. Its very laggy. Sometimes it wont mark a 
task as complete, and other times i cant click on certain options that are 
supposed to ne available in th classroom. Just a moment ago while my child 
was in the Pet section it was stuck on loop saying""fish food alphabet"" at 
the same time as another audio explaining directions was playing. Maybe the 
website is worth paying for, but the app surely is not.",
"Very glitchy lately...keeps dropping off our wifi while my son is trying to 
do the lessons. I also wish there were a way to lock him out of the games 
until he spends a certain amount of time or makes a certain amount of 
progress in the learning path portion, because he keeps going to the pets 
or more advanced games, etc.",
"I would like my money back. I cannot get into it. I have paid for it and 
installed it and it won't log in at all.",
"Make you provide payment options before you can even play the games. Felt 
like a ""forgot to cancel"" and make money revenue model.",
"I love ABC Mouse but this app is impossible to use. I have an S8 the app 
has only opened correctly twice even after uninstalling and re installing. 
It's nearly impossible to get logged in and even once you do it's 
impossible to switch between kid accounts, the coding and images are not 
lining up correctly or at all within the correct window size. I wish they 
would fix this but they've failed to do so for a while now so I have no 
choice but to rate it low.",
"It never loads or works on my daughter's tablet . extremely slow and not 
helpful if she just gets frustrated when trying to access it",
"It's great for me because I'm 7 years old and I love it but I have no 
internet on the phone so I can't use it",
"I just got an email about a promo and decided to try it. I opened the app 
and every link works EXCEPT the log in button! I can highlight the words 
but it doesn't act as a button! If I can fix this I will gladly edit my 
review but right now I'm just disappointed.",
"So many glitches, pages don't return to the appropriate activities and 
menus. Some don't load or mark ""complete"" . You have to supervise the whole 
time to help with the glitches. Disappointed, waiting for the subscription 
to end.",
"It's been helpful for my daughter. She gets to learn and practice fun 
things during her allowed screen time.",
"It's good but my son got bored of it really quick.He liked earning things 
but got bored of the songs. I think they should add videos to the songs or 
have it optional to have videos with the songs to interest kids more.He 
loves the puzzles .",
"Would be nice if I could log into something I paid for. Tapping on the 
login button does nothing. Only the ""30 day free trial"" buttons work.",
"Can't log in. Log in button doesn't work on Samsung s7 edge. Will update 
when we can log in",
"I cancelled abc mouse after, the free trial and not only have abc mouse 
charged my account once but twice I'm outraged!!! Worse online app ever",
"Okay so I'm trying to cancel my account but every time I try it's sending 
me to a link to download the app. I did and when I try to log in I can't. 
This app sucks and since this was a free trail I better not be charged. 
ü§¢üò°üò°üò°",
"I love that this app is not only educational but it keeps my child engaged! 
She always wants to come back and learn more!",
"It's a great app, I love how much my son has learned. It just freezes quite 
often. If it wasn't for the that id give it 5 stars",
"I cant login to my app!! Had to get a new phone downloaded it and the link 
at the top wont work. I use this app all the time and my son has learned 
alot! Please fix",
"My kids love to use ABC mouse every day they ask me can I do my lessons 
today dad. Sitting down with my kids and watching them learn something new 
every day is exciting.",
"My son is four and loves using this program. It's a wonderful introduction 
to future online learning programs, as well as a fun interactive way to do 
review with your child. I highly recommend it for preschool and Pre-K 
children.",
I can't even login on the app on my phone. Some serious design flaws.,
"I like the app but it keeps freezing up and I have to restart it over and 
over again.",
"Would be nice if I could log in. It's just a web view app, and clicking the 
login button does nothing.",
I don't have a password you can see me your password please thank you,
"ABC Mouse kids a great app that teaches my chil, even when we are on the 
road! I recommended this to everyone I know.",
"Why do we have to pay for it like my kid needs to learn like that is so 
stupid.",
"This app is terrible, don't trust it. It makes u have to put ur email, use 
something better fellow parents!",
"Extremely glitchy can seem to login was charged and then they sent me an 
email that they'll cancel my subscription after i had already emailed them 
about login problems never again my daughter gets extremely bored of it the 
3 times it worked.",
"The app isnt letting me log in, I tap on the log in option but nothing 
happens",
Best thing I could ever do for my 3 yr old,
"My 4 yr old thinks it's boring. It's hard to get her to use the app. It's 
very repetitive.",
"I just want to unsubscribe. When I try to log in, the screen goes black 
Everytime. This is a huge waste of your time and effort. To ever consider 
this for your child.",
"i haate this app this is the worst app in the whole world and if this app 
the people in that company is ass",
"I bought this app for my cousin's and they love it. They are learning so 
much and they enjoy it!",
"I got charged 19.75 for 2 months and was not able to enter the app. I have 
tried to get ahold of someone and no answer! Very disappointed!",
"I can't login and I have paid for a year subscription on my phone app i tap 
on login and nothing happens otherwise I would give it a five star my kids 
love abc mouse",
"I love it my son loves it and I will continue to let him have this app and 
the good thing we can have more then one child and I'm having another baby 
so my son can teach his sibling to learn with ABC mouse as well",
"Downloaded the app twice, it will not let me log in, waste of money if I 
can't access it!",
I love it but the app refuse to let me log in,
I like it! It helps your kids really learn.,
"The best app for any child to learn on.. it's easy and fun for any child to 
use",
"Both of my kids love the games and videos. They enjoy learning on here. 
(Ages 2 & 5)",
"Best learning app out!! So many things to do. So full of fun and learning!! 
My children have gained so much from this app. Thank you so much!!",
"App shucks, doesn't work most of the time.",
"My grandchildren love ABCMouse! To see their excitement as the play & 
learn, is amazing!",
My little girl truly enjoys the books and activities this app provides.,
The log in button doesnt work,
Super! My child loves it and is learning so much!,
Abc mouse is awesome best tool ever to help my babies,
It's a good game for little kids to learn so much,
I'm mad and I'm crossed with you I hate the game,
Way too slow to load anything,
My daughter loves playing on this one and she is learning so much,
This software is great for teaching my little ones. Fantastic product.,
Its everything and more granddaughter loves it thank you for a wonderful app,
It is rily helping my kids learn,
"My daughter loves it. Were just starting out, so far it's great.",
Our soon to be 4 year old enjoys this very much!,
It helped our son focus as well as patience.,
I love it .. my kids love it too,
It's the best education app for my little boy,
this is a great way to educate your child at home/school,
My kids love the hours of fun and learning sessions.,
Accurate grade by grade content that helps me to help my child.,
Couldn't cancel and payed for 2 months that my son couldn't even use.,
They charge it on your credit card not on your tablet,
My kids love it very much.,
Thanks ABC mouse my son loves it,
I think it is the best app in the world,
Best educational app ever!,
It won't even download,
"BIG SCAM THEY KEEP TAKING MONEY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT EVEN WHEN PAID FOR A 
CHARGE THATS NOT EVEN LISTED DO NOT DOWNLOAD",
It took my money off my card. :-(,
My children love this app!,
My grandson loves the app!,
I think it's helpful,
I got this at my school but it is sunnertime and now I can't go back,
It's the bomb,

Poooo,

It is very bat game,
ü¶Ñüç¶üòáüåå,
Still this king,
ABC refik,
You have to pay!!!!!!!!!,
Wow,
I i,
GO,
No,
sucks,
"I like the idea and the games are great , but only outside of his learning path. The learning path is repetitive and nothing like what you see on the commercials. He doesn't learn anything. He knows all his letters , sounds and numbers but even on level 5 ( kindergarten) that's all it teaches. Please revise the learning path by changing it to be geared to the level of the child and not a generic path.",
"Worst paid app ever made... Super laggy and its just poorly made. They have 
so much commercial on tv... it is very luring and I did sign up for 1 year 
and come to the conclusion my kids only wanted tickets to buy hamster and 
play with it. Their lesson plan sucks. And kids got bored after using for a 
month due to lagginess and nothing fun. Its always singing, videos, 
coloring... samething over and over... there is a pizzle that always goes 
back to level 0 when my child should be on level 3. Its sooo much time 
consuming trying to get it to work! seriously... those 5 star probably fake 
reviews.. I had kept changing levels for 2 of my kids and they literally 
learned nothing... stay away from it.",
"The app and program itself is great. We started using it four years ago and 
my kids lived it. Customer service and billing, however, not so much. We 
hadn't used it in months as my kids are getting older and I didn't realize 
my bill was coming due. Usually a recurring service will notify you before 
billing you. This is not the case with ABC mouse. I realized they debited 
my account and contacted them the same day to request a refund as we 
haven't even logged in to the service for months and they would not budge. 
I've been in customer service for 11 years and have had excellent 
experiences with Amazon so I was very disappointed with the attitude of the 
company for this product.",
"It is not easy to use at all for my toddler. The graphics are not inviting. 
It doesn't seem to help them follow a pattern for use or learning. My 
daughter is not interested in the app.",
"The app has been a great addition for my kid to learn more. It has really 
provided kids the opportunity to enjoy learning. Very helpful and 
affordable too.",
"The content itself was alright but my child didn't like it or use it. So I 
cancelled my account and went through the whole ""why are you cancelling 
your account"" stuff, got a confirmation of the cancellation and they are 
still charging my card!! But when I logged back in it is cancelled! No 
games no activities but they are still charging me",
"I just wish it would work 17 hours after creating account it is still 
loading on both devices. My very excited child did not get opportunity to 
use it bad start",
"I Love it my Son is doing so much better in school and it helps my daughter 
learn before kindergarten and they are learning so much!!!!!",
"Excellent app. Is educational and entertaining, kids learn while having fun.",
"Amazing, my kids love it and they're learning. It's so easy to use for them 
and me.",
"I will wait till my child is ready for this app, but overall is a good app.",
My daughter loves this app and she really is learning more than i expected!,
Excellent app for kids. Mine love it and learn a lot!,
This did not help my child at all,
"My 2 year hates this!!!! I don't see how its a award-winning learning 
academy!!!!",
I wood think that the company who made the game is amazing,
It's never available when we want to play with it.,
My kids want to learn now because of ABC mouse üêÅ,
"My 1 year old loves music so much of his time is devoted to the music area 
and he follows along for other areas",
Nearly impossible to cancel subscription.,
ABC mouse has helped my kiddos.,
Love it. It's an awesome app for kids,
GREAT FOR THE LITTLE KIDS :),
love this for my 2 and 4 year old!,
It can be better word's,
My child loves learning with this app,
Easy to learn for kids.,
Great app for toddlers.,
Keeps freezing!!!,
Perfectly made for my daughter,
It is a good game to me,
My daughter loves this app,
My little girl love it,
Its perfect üòÉ,
Too expensive,
My kids love it,
Great for learning,
This is a nice,
This is awesome,
Cool,
Cool,
Great,
Love it,
Fabulous,
"I've been trying to cancel my membership and it won't let me. I have it on 
my phone and don't have any access to computers near me and no car. I don't 
want to be charged for not using it. I don't even open the app n when I do 
it's to try and cancel membership!!! Please fix!!!!",
It we,
Meh,
"I have tried to cancel my subscription for TWO MONTHS now but every time I 
try there is an ""issue"" with the app (which is apparently the only way I 
can cancel the subscriotion) which prevents me from doing so. I've been 
charged 60$ worth of fees because of this and I am LIVID. If someone does 
not cancel this subscription soon I'm going to loose my mind.",
Horrible app right out of the gate. You must give them your email and credit card information to use the app for even a month.  Why not just make it a firm price from Google play. Instead now these scheming people have my email because I decline to share credit card information who gets people emails for nothing.,
"Do not sign up for the month trial, it will not let you cancel before its 
up! I figured I try it to see if my daughter liked it. She did not I put it 
on for her she'd become bored and exit to use other apps. So I figured I'd 
cancel before the end of the trial and it did not let me. Very aggravating 
to pay for this useless app.",
"This app would be great for my toddler. It has great learning activities and a performance tracker for parents. However, on all platforms, it is EXTREMELY SLOW. The startup takes forever, along with the beginning and ending of each lesson. Any page change takes about a minute to load up; sometimes more. This doesn't help with keeping the attention of a 2 year old. Performance of this app is not good. Because of that alone, I probably won't be renewing my membership after this trial.",
"It'd be better suited for an iPad or a similar device. I only have a phone and my toddler doesn't pay much attention to anything on a screen so it's not right for us, at least not yet.  I'd love to cancel my free trial membership before you people decide to charge me for a service I won't be using in the near future. I can't navigate to the cancellation page on the app; I have stared at a white screen with a blue border for half an hour now and it wants me to log back in to the parents section and it does the same with the customer support page. Please fix this ASAP",
"Absolute waste of money... My two year old seems not at all interested in 
the app that I signed up for a free trial and got charged 21 bucks for. He 
will not stay on it longer than five minutes. I cannot cancel the 
membership because it goes to a blank white square with a blue border, 
whether we use his tablet, a phone or desktop. He seems to learn more 
watching YouTube videos, maybe because they use real children and real toys 
(he likes cars) to help him learn. And YouTube red is cheaper than ABC 
mouse and works just fine. Please cancel my free (paid membership) trial. 
Thanks",
"I really like this app. he only thing i am having a hard time with is 
getting my three year old to get in to it more ,and try to understand it 
better. i feel there should be more options for children with slow and even 
problematic learning disablities",
"The app frequently errors and every time we open it, it has trouble 
orienting to the position of the device. Otherwise it's great and just like 
the site. My 2 year old loves learning and loves this. My 3 year old loves 
to learn, but hates to sit still. This keeps him engaged and he loves it. I 
saw reviews complaining because it ""hits them over the head with 
learning""... Well, that's what education is!!! It simply makes learning 
fun. I really appreciate ABC mouse.",
"App sucks, hard to work around for the kids. Is expensive and no refunds whatsoever. Updates erase data is just troublesome.",
"Its awesome but right now it is not loading right. Its stuck on a loading 
screen and will not work. My 2 year old is very upset.",
"What I don't like about abcmiuse is that I can't suspend or cancels the 
membership.. it tells me how but when i click on it it stays blank. Unjust 
want to suspend it until he gets his own child friendly tablet but once I 
figure out how to.ot I'm just going to cancel it.",
"I have been trying to cancel my account and it won't let me. Gonna be 
pissed if they charge me.",
Unable to cancel subscription as it does not allow me to log in. So i tried resetting password and it says i have an invalid email. Tried contacting customer service and no one has reached out to me.,
This is a scam. It won't let you unsubscribe after taking your card details,
"My child doesn't need it anymore. I'm trying to cancel and the info given 
(on the newest version) is blank! There's NO way to contact them to cancel. 
All that info is BLANK. There's nothing to follow, no link, NO info under 
contact us either!!! Rip off take your money!",
I signed up for the trial and now it won't let me unsubscribe.  I refuse to pay for something my child doesn't like. So this really needs to be fixed,
"Do not sign up. It is impossible to unsubscribe, they take your info and 
charge you but when you try to cancel it redirects the page or the ap 
freezes and goes to a blank screen. It's a scam to trap you into a monthly 
subscription.",
"This is great for when she has to go with me to appointments. I'd much rather she played ABC Mouse than the DS or something like that, and ABC Mouse holds her attention better. AND she's excited to play it! My daughter is 4.",
"Using this app was a turning point for my autistic son. One improvement suggestion - make it less easy to log out. Have to re-log in multiple times when my kids accidentally log off, and there is no auto-fill option",
"Very helpful and educational love it so does my son he love going and do 
his work as well as play games..",
"Resubscribes you does not have easy access for cancelling account. 
Completely and utterly frustrated",
"Do NOT subscribe! When you click on the link that says cancel subscription 
it takes you to a blank page. I havent been able to find a customer support 
# either",
"Be careful downloading this it will charge u monthly. Layout is too 
confusing for a child.",
"It's great app I used it for all my three kids and they have been enjoying 
it since then. My daughter she's seven and until know she love to do it.",
"Would have loved to use this app but after I subscribed it kept kicking us 
out we didn't even get to try a lesson out",
Good content but doesnt work often. Even with new tablets still slow.,
Tried to cancel per their directions but link wouldn't work.,
"I can't cancel my account, can't report a bug or get in contact. I need my 
account cancelled please fix that Update 4/20/18 I was able to cancel my 
account on my laptop on mobil the tab wouldn't load",
Got the free month but won't let me unsubscribe it goes to a blank screen really needs to be fixed.,
"I love that my kids can have fun learning! The only reason I chose 4 out of 5 is because lately there seems to be more glitches than normal, but this app is great!",
"It's been 2 months and that's $20 down the drain. I hate this app! I wish I 
would have flushed a $20 bill down the toilet instead of paying for this 
lame app.",
It's great. My daughter loves the fact she gets to learn and play at the same time.,
"My two little girls just absolutely love this app, ages 4 & 8. Thank you 
for creating such a helpful learning tool for the younger children!!",
More concerned money than education. Go figure.,
"Crashes and lags at times on iPad, but seems to work fine on the phone.",
"This is absolutely ridiculous. I paid $8 for an app that I can't even use 
without a $10 monthly subscription!!! Biggest waste of money ever. Do not 
buy this app. It doesn't even state that it requires a monthly 
subscription. This is such a scam it isn't even funny. Don't be me. Keep 
your money.",
I hate the app my kids don't need app it's bad my kids hate it,
"Loved it! The children like to play even when its not ""lesson"" time",
"This app is so helpful it helped my little sister get ready for pre k and 
she is so smart creative",
My daughter loves ABC mouse! Glad we decided to get a membership.,
My son loves this app. He is learning so much everyday,
I have yet to find a better education app anywhere on the internet.,
"4 children ages 5 and under are all enjoying this app. This is a happy 
mommy.",
Very fun and educational app for kids to use. My daughter loves it.,
It helped my sister a lot and now I'm trying it on my daughter,
"It helped my 4 month son to learn and talk he is saying stuff like put me 
in preschool it is sooo cuteee",
My daughter loves and looks forward to doing ABC Mouse!!!,
My son really enjoys this app!,
Loved using abc mouse for when my kids were younger.,
I am only 7 but I like iT,
I love this app is amazing it's super fun,
This app is Great Learning for Children!,
This program doesn't have any sound in my android phone.,
We just love ABC mouse,

My BB and I love it!!!! Thank you.,
"I think this app sucks and my daughter didn't learn anything. 
üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°",

Everyone should have this app,
I like ches,
Booooo,
Yes,
"**Edit: still taking money after we discontinued use** We like this program but there are issues. If this program was free I'd simply delete it, but I have paid in advance and I'm sure it's nonrefundable so I hope these issues are resolved sooner than later. The app will open or will close randomly. Certain areas of the app will keep buffering, sometimes it will load after multiple attempts or reopening of the app if it loads at all. It is frustrating for me and the children. Fix it, we haven't paid for something that works only sometimes",
"Great content!!! Love how educational it is, but gave 3 star bc there needs to be a tablet/mobile version of app. It performs very poorly on mobile devices. Please fix! We pay for a subscription, it's pointless if we can't use it on the go on our other devices. Thank you.",
This is horrible I have been trying  to cancel and it's just not possible  I think I'm gonna have to talk to my attorney,
I love this program. It help my 5 year old get prepared  for kindergarten and now it is helping my 6 month old son.,
With the new update I'm not able to talk with customers service or do anything with my account on my phone.,
Having trouble opening pages.  There coming up blank. I will have 2 cancel.,
√èt's perfect for my granddaugh ter. She is able to get into everything needed to read and do  mathematics  among other things. I'm very happy.,
Don't waste your time. It's not really free. Then when you try to sign up it says invalid email. Tried 2 emails. Big waste of time. False advertising.,
I can't cancel.. it keeps taking me to a blank page I'm getting charged because I can't figure out why it won't allow me to cancel other then threw the app and it goes to a blank page when trying to contact customer service so that I can cancel so I can stop being charged for something my son has no interest in it also goes to a blank page,
This app is great for my 4 and 7 yr old. There is so much for them to do! We have it installed on ipads and phones so they can play on the go.,
ABC Mouse is by far the best learning  app I have found for my 7 and 5 year old. The linked family of apps by age of learning inc are also icing on the cake. Impressive job! A big thank you to the app developers.,
Recently some of the pages don't come up.  When you try to send comments to customer service the page won't come up.  Pages open but are blank so my daughter can't do the pages to progress.  Only started recently but it's happening on both the laptop and phone.  Hopefully you are working to get this fixed quickly.,
You gotta pay for a subscription. Ain't nobody got money to be wasting on a website.,
So far my LO is just at the beginning stage of learning and what's messed up is he doesn't know how to swipe or tap the screen. I'm certain over time he'll pick this up in time. I love it especially since it was free.,
Rip-off. My son didn't like it so I'm trying to cancel and every time the app freezes. Such a scam.,
"Both my kids love it secretly teaching my kids. I guess I don't expect them to use this one as often. It they both do, and have both learned a lot in no time.",
App is a scam. It wouldnt let me cancel and there is ZERO customer support. Beware. SCAM.,
"I recommend ABC mouse to every parent I speak to, it's that good, my kids learn a lot.",
Why do I see games you have pay for? Maybe in the future every game will be free for ever and no one has to pay ever again. Maybe I don't know. ü§î,
Hate it its borring you need to pay with cridet card,
I think it's dumb you have to sighn inüò°,
The app will not load!!! I've tried it on two different phones as well as a tablet. The screen just stays yellow and my kids can not use it.,
I hate it!you have to pay for it after you get the app!it's tareble!,
"Love the different levels, compliments in class learning and easy to use on school breaks to keep kids brains going!",
CAN'T CANCEL!!! My son was able to accidentally sign up for this app bc my credit card was stored in my phone. Now I'm trying to cancel it and there is no way to cancel the subscription!!! üò°,
It just keeps loading. Can't get anything to play or show up.,
Great program that helps my 2-7 year old learn in an interactive fun way.,
I just love it so much. A fun way to learn.,
My 6 year old and I are having a great time learning together!,
My son and I absolutely love this! I just wish it would provide more points,
I love it but they should add both language English and Spanish me and my kids loved it,
I think that it would be a good India to have a tablet in school and put ABC mouse on it,
Such a great tool to help my children learn English‚ô°,
Love it and both my girls love it!,
So far she loves this and it seems she understands it very well.,
"I am disappointed, it says spanish.... but everything is offered in English... you shouldn't put that option if its only to translate the instruction.",
Very good curriculum for a kids and educational.,
A great early start for all children!,
Abc mouse is for people that get all a's,
My 2 year old loves it!!,
"Absolutely horrible for,3 year olds. üò£",
Im trying to cancel it and it won't let me!!!,
It really does help your kids,
my sister loved it and me.,
Charge you if you didn't use it,
I couldn't get my granddaughters account set up,
Its a vool and sweet game brtaaahhh!!!!,
My daughter loves this!!!! It's helping her so much!!!,
My granddaughter Love's this. Her school!!!,
Woould not work on phone,
My kids love it.,
"Won't let me  cancel, always loads but shows nothing but the blue background and white and the back  button!!! Fix it.",
That's is helping the kids,
Love the learning skills.,
Charlie Jo loves it!,
Best educational app ever,
Is a great learning app,

"All parents should have this. My 4 year old daughter starts school this year. She's way ahead of her game watching hw r tell me shapes l like octagon is amazing all the colors not just basic, her math skills are hua t out of this world. I love ABC Mouse try it out you can always delete and cancel",
The app keeps crashing plus the headings are illegable blocks. I was going to entertain my children with this app during spring break since we will be traveling but I will be searching for something else. It's a shame because they love using it on the computer.,
"I am cancelling subscription because the programs generally does not load the majority of the time, regardless of where I am and what device I am on. It's very frustrating for my child. Troubleshooting has been to no avail. Do not waste your money.",
My 4 and 5 year old both love the app. So easy for them to follow and it has helped them learn so many new things.,
My six year old loves abcmouse. He likes the variety of games and lessons. He really enjoys collecting prizes.,
Can't log on. Can't get tech help. Haven't used this since February but can't cancel/uninstall,
"My daughter was excited about it at first, then she had no interest in it. I cancelled my subscription, and now they are billing me for an assessment subscription which I didn't subscribe to and  I am having a hard time canceling that!!!!",
Good except my daughter stoped using it then came back so it made her do 1st grade stuff when she was is second grade because you cannot chang your grade.,
It's a great  app my 2 year old daughter loves it,
The app some how after updating is no longer allowing to keep track or check the progress of my users.,
This program is great my son is 2 and loves it and I love how educational it is.,
I love it but it will not let me in my room i I installed it and maybe it will be fixed,
Love the fact my babies are learning while having fun!,
Great activities and lessons! My son loves it!,
It's cool for my little brother,
I have tried to delete my account three times every time I get a blank screen! Why is there no way to contact any of you?! Hated it! It sucks!,
I can't even cancel it,
My 2 year-old daughter loves this app!!!,
awesome product!,
It's awesome,
Love it,
Awesome,
Only for baby's,
"App updated on Kindle Fires and now no longer stays open. Gets as far as tapping on their avatars, then crashes. Contacted customer service and was told maybe the Fire doesn't support the app anymore. Seriously? YOUR app updated, of course it's still supported on the Fire. Maybe since there are some angry reviews here too, it will actually get fixed.   Will gladly update my review if this gets fixed, because my kids really like this app... when it's working. They were disappointed they couldn't play today and of course don't understand why they can't.",
"I love this app and so does my 3 yr old daughter,  it's helped her learn so much already in such a short time, I wish I had it for all my kids but I can't wait to get my 1 yr old daughter into it as well. Excellent teaching program this this age. I don't know who loves it more, me or my 3 yr old. I highly recommend this to everyone,  plus it's totally worth the price.",
My sons not interested in this app. And im not sure how to get him interested. My son has been not getting his proper amount of tickets most of the time.  I wish i could get through to someone in customer service so i can explain it in greater detail.  Sat on the phone for over 1 hour listening to childrens songs just to be hung up on!,
"I love the ABC mouse program and so do my kids (3-6), but it crashes ALL THE TIME! There are so many bugs in the app and even on the pc version that my eldest can't move forward on her learning path and we've had to switch back and firth between the two platforms to get all the content. But she can still access the activities outside of the path and earn tickets and learn. I am hoping for an update soon that fixes the issue with the activity she's stuck on.",
"Very dissatisfied, got billed 2 times within 4 days and was not credited a refund. Will not be recommending to other parents.",
I have 3 kids that I home school and my oldest caught on to things quickly and needed very little help. However my two boys have had trouble with letters and sounds. ABC Mouse has them catching back up so fast I have trouble keeping up now. LOL  They do need to change the renewal process to be able to send a payment as soon as it is ready instead of waiting for for it to try and take it. I had it ready and my card took a fee right before they did so there wasn't enough and now l have to wait for it to try again.,
"We have a subscription to ABCmouse, so we were excited to use the app also, but it's terrible! We can't even get to the content without typing in the password every time you click a button. It's ridiculous to think that a 3yo will be able to type our password every few seconds and still remain interested in trying to get to a game. Such a Pity to have a great product - that a child can't use on an app.",
Really great for children especially for home schooled children... The assessments are helpful as well to determine what areaand or areas the child needs work on/ in.,
"My 5 year old sister had trouble with communication and simple education because a lack of teaching from my older brother when she was 3, with ABC mouse and some at home practices she can now speak mostly full sentences and has great math abilities and understands grammer, ABC mouse is very effective!",
"Never subscribed got billed on a monthly basis anywhere from $7.99 up to 
$9.99 per month for over a year, spoke with Amy from ABCmouse she says they 
do not offer refunds especially when it was in their error, very poor 
customer service skills disappointing",
My three year old grandson has learned so much from this app. Learning while having fun.,
"My daughter has been using it for a few months now and we love it! She likes the songs and puzzles, her coloring has improved, and she enjoys gaining points to dress up her avatar!",
It's soooo boring I thing I cant do it no longer I'm only in 2 grade!,
My daughter loves playing and earning tickets. It's really helping her get ready for school.,
"Not only does my toddler love it, but I do as well.",
I think it's great that the kids have interest im learning other than video games with violence,
You can't use it if you don't pay,
It did not hold my 2 year old attention maybe when she gets older,
My brother loves this so much he thinks he's playing a game without work but he is,
My two and three old both love it. My three year older  is now  reading at a first grade level,
A tad bit boring sometimes but my son loves it.,
Not really a free app. Have to pay to play. Not worth it.,
"In the short time. We see a change in her,learning interest.",
Its very good because ts going to give kids get knowledge.,
I have a 3 year old and she loves this its fun and she learns a lot,
i got this for my 2 year old and she loves it she is one this site all the time what a grate app to have,
i love it but you shouldnt have to pay please be a free app,
gggggu7uuuu776 tomboi jhonson galibnya junk,
I downloaded this for my siblings and they love it,
I love it so much thank you guys,
A very fun and productive learning program for young kids.,
"I love this app,kid friendly and helpful to have on hands",
Good app for my son it helps him understand better god bless whoever thought of this,
This app is very useful and my 1yr old loves it however it would be easier if she could work it better,
I love it. N same my daughter love it also,
Too many distractions to be educational.,
My son loves it. So happy with it,
I think that this is the best app for children,
OK it's OK I haft to pay for it,
"Amazing app, my kids love it.",
I love the different forms of learning it offers.,
It  will frizz  and I have to close out and start  it back up once or twice so the child can go on but over all the children love it,
Fantastic app for multiple kids,
It great for my child,
I think i loved the game,
Bad app,

"Asked to download by a shady source, one of those gift card offers, they make you give your credit card and don't make it easy at all to unsubscribe.  The unsubscribe link in email only unsubscribes you from communication, forcing you to redownload the app if you deleted it.  I forgot my password and have yet to receive an email giving me options to  choose a new one, blocking me from access to the app which allows me to unsubscribe and not be billed month to month.  Scam.",
My child showed zero interest in this app. I paused the account to see if she would ask to use it on her own. She didn't. ABC mouse then took it upon themselves to reinstate my account and charge me without so much as even an email to alert me. So now I'm out EVEN MORE money for a worthless app. I regret ever signing up for this nonsense. Huge mistake!,
"Love the app and kids do too, but there is a slight lag when switching from one screen to the next and we keep getting white screens and ""thinking/loading"" for long durations. This is between multiple devices. We purchased our membership two days ago so hoping it gets better. Otherwise it's super fun, nice graphics, lots of games and activities for learning. The ticket incentives encourage the kids to complete lessons quickly for purchases. Work out those bugs and our rating will be 5 stars. üòä",
"It's amazing! I love ABC Mouse. I have three kids, ages 5, 3, and just turned 1 and they ALL LOVE IT. I had no problem getting the program for them over so many other non-educational apps/games. I would recommend ABC Mouse to ANYONE with kids, grandkids, niece's, nephews, etc.",
I can never get the app to open up since first downloaded. Pretty bad . I have paid for full year and can't even use it,
S6 Edge - This is great. Just in a couple months my daughter when from barely speaking to creating full sentances and catching up to her level.,
"I was hopeful given that I found this listed at #3 on the Top Free Education apps. That hope was for nothing because it's not actually free, but subscription based. Another case of false advertising...",
Just started the free trial for our 2 year old and we like it so far. I hope the discounts for payments be offered again.,
My daughter is almost 2 and loves all the music. My son is 4and he loves it; he practically begs me to play it every morning,
I love the website but the app shuts down every time i try to open a learning part to start my child on. If this keeps up i may not continue this program since technical support is lacking.,
"There's been a lot of days app doesn't work properly. Also why does the alphabet not stay in order,their all over the place. Would be nice to start at A and work to Z but you have to continuesly scroll.",
My son won't put this app down he loves it would rather be on this then watching TV,
My daughter loves this app. I can see a big improvement since she started using this app.... Thank you ABC mouse,
"NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MOBILE DEVICES.  Everthing is to small with no option to zoom in. However, perfect for tablets and pc devices. Highly Recommended. Just not on mobile units",
My 2 yrs old son loves the songs and the games. This app has helped so much with is verbal skills.,
"Okay, the honest truth is I love abcmouse but please make it free cuz It was boring when I was litte now i can't play it.",
It helps me learn it is fun it makes me want to go to learn even though it was teaching me second grade skills that I learned in kindergarten it is awesome and I caught up to it and now it's teaching things I have no idea aboutüíñüíÉ,
My daughter loves ABC Mouse! I can see so much improvement in her speech and vocabulary since she started learning with the app and website.,
My homeschooled 6 year old is doing independent study and loves doing ABC mouse verse the parts of school she does with Mom.  My 2 year old does not like it yet but likes to do things with Mom.  ABC mouse is a great tool to help parents to educate their children in a fun way!,
It takes so long to load anything my kids lose interest and don't wanna play because of it...I mean something like they want to feed their animal and they're pressing the feed button 20 times and then the food finally shows up..same thing happens with answers while playing the games,
"My children and I use this app almost everyday, they absolutely love it! It's fun, easy to use, and really does help them with their education.",
All 3 of my children loves the app and I see them progress. They range on 1-4 years old,
This app has helped my 3 year old daughter take off with learning! She loves it and so do I!,
"My 5 year was interested for a day maybe 2 then he was over it, it wasn't as captivating as other learning apps.",
It is a good learning tool yes but it is really slow to respond and has bad glitches in it,
1. Overpriced. 2. She was never interested in it for more than 5 minutes.,
"I love the content, but it seems to freeze a lot!",
"Every time I try opening the app it never loads, I might end up canceling what's the point in paying if my 5 year old can never play it?",
"Update the look of coloring pages and some of the book contents..overall, impressive.",
Helps my kids learn an have fun at the same time,
Started my 3 year old on it. He loves it!,
"The app has a lot of activities in it but would frequently freeze on both my phone and our tablet, even after uninstalling and reintalling. I chose the yearly plan initially. When my year was up I never received a email stating it was up for renewal, they just charged my card.  They are difficult to get in contact with,  only message through their app, no phone number. They say they don't  give refunds they just cancel your subscription a year later.  EVEN THOUGH I DON'T WANT ANOTHER YEAR!!! I'm sure they soak a lot of people for money this way. Unfortunate!",
Thos app is making my kid learn more and more everyday,
EMAIL ALARM DEVICE ID NUMBER,
Fun and educational. A variety of fun engaging ways to learn.,
Fun way for kids to learn. Good mix of games in there to keep them interested,
My 4 yr old loves learning with this app,
ABC mouse is a perfect app for children like me!,
I like it but it keeps closing,
Why do i have to pay for it awwüò£,
So many lesson for my child to learn. Never gets boring! My child loves it!!!!,
My two boys love this app.,
I like it when I was in high school and I have been working in the morning I will be working from home tomorrow and I will be there at noon and I have to go to the gym and I have been working on my car and my phone üòòüòç,
Great app! Kids are learning a lot!,
My daughter love this App. Keeps busy,
"Not free. Have to sign up with credit card. No sample. No test, just a credit card sign up page you cannot bypass. Uninstall.",
So terrible. And $30 is robbery.,
It is not a good app,
My granddaughter loves it it is so helpful My granddaughter,
Keeps the kids interested,
This is  for kindergarteners brrr r,
Love it great for kids,
I love it,
I love it,
Great,
Great,
Its a beginning for the little people,
So worth it!!!,
It sinks,
Eh,
"Horrible customer service. Tried the site to see what it was about. Found it was just not what I was looking for with my son so I cancelled same day. Deleted the app and didn't think about it again until I realized for months I was being charged for it and they never cancelled. Had to reinstall to email support, waited for days to get a response and then days again to try and find out what happened. Had to finally call cs to be told they could give me 6 months free to make up for it. Why would I want 6 free months when I never even used it for a day. BE WARNED if they take your information and you choose to cancel, regardless if it was a site problem or not. They WILL not cancel or refund you! Would never recommend!",
"Horrible... Friends had great experience so I thought I'd  let my son play with ABC mouse. Same activities throughout the application. My child was bored of the application quickly and many of the activities we're far too easy for him. ALSO!!! IF YOU CANCEL EARLY IT WILL END YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. Meaning I paid for a year and cancelled my subscription, charged for the year, but was only able to use the app at the date of my cancellation.",
"I chose ""pre-kindergarten"" and they had my son putting together sentences. I expected it to start with basic phonics to first teach the letter sounds. I noticed there was and option to change the level in the settings, but it wouldn't allow me to save the changes. The ""yes"" option wouldn't click, but the ""no"" option would. It was just one issue after another.",
Scammed out of 30 day free trial and was charged in FULL! Now they won't even return my emails. I've had this for 1 day before I realized they charged my account. My son is 3 and I wanted to test the service before committing to a heafty charge,
Ultra gay and retarded it didnt teach my daughter jason anything and she is now crying because there isnt a mouse in her classroom. Go eat a peanut butter and glass samwhich. This creation shouldnt be here! Whoever created this is mental. Cancer,
"Not recommended for phones.  If could read teeny printed screen instructions, then App is so far below intelligence to be any more than fueling encouragements in exercising stupidity. Uninstalling, stay away.",
"DO NOT LIKE THIS APP, SORRY BUT IT DOES NOT TEACH ANYTHING TO YOUR KID, DONT GET IT. IT KEEPS CHARGING MY BANK ACCOUNT AND I DONT EVEN HAVE THE APP ANYMORE, I KEEP TRYING TO CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION AND THERES NO WAY TO DO IT. IT SAYS EASY CANCELLATION. WELL THATS A LIE.",
"Too hard to control! My son couldn't put the level 9 puzzle together, he loves puzzles, and I had a heck of a time doing it for him. He cried and cried because he wanted to put the puzzle together and couldn't.",
It is impossible to set up the kids information on a phone. However she loved it and didn't want to stop using it once she started.,
It says it'll give you one month free but after that you have to pay 999 a month it will not let me do anything else without continuing and agreeing to the one month free and then after that I'll have to pay $9.99 a month I did not want to pay for the learning app I'm sure it is wonderful and it will help but I cannot afford $9.99 a month,
"My daughter has used this since she was 3. It makes learning fun for her. She actually gets up early for school so she can do her ""learning"". üíñ",
"Advertised a free trial period in which i could cancel subscription at ""any time"" - can't find a way to do so. Also, I got charged for the subscription DURING the free trial period, as well as a charge of ¬£1.00 extra for no apparent reason.",
"Want let me open the app, I've tried uninstall and re install and still want work",
This game came as a CD game with my gateway desktop computer and my 2yr old was reading and spelling by the age of 3! Last time I tried to get this app it cost money please don't charge for this my grandkids want to play it an my disk is cracked. Let them learn for free. Please! Just charge a one time fee for the app not for every little thing If I remember correctly. It's a great learning game Thank you.,
"Scam...wont let you unsubscribe and charges your card before the ""free trail"" is over",
Edit: Sorry for my behavior in my one star review. I was young and I really wanted to use this. I tried it a few months later and it was great! Super easy to use. I can't pay so I downloaded this for nothing!!!,
You can't use the app unless you have an accepted credit card it said free in the app store so sad  I would love to have it for my kids,
Just one big ad for subscription website,
Wasting hours of my time trying to remove subscription,
It has help my daughter improve in her learning,
Abc mouse is great at help me to learn and you are to creators of the gam,
My grand daughter was 4 sinse she loved it  and she still loved lt,
ABC mouse is not cool its OKüò∂,
It can go over the age of 5 because how good it is.,
My little sister loves this game,
Great for my 5 year old,
I love it it's great for the kids,
Had to wait for the down load to find out it was a free trial,
I have been playing it for years now I am 36 and my sister Emma she is in kindergarten and the teacher keeps saying that she does everything wrong and i know that it is a good game and I love it so I think my sister will love it too,
"This is not a free app, they demand payment information when you open this app.",
I like ABC mouse. Com because you get to play a lot of games,
I hated it,
It really helps,
Great app,
Horrible,
all good,
I can't use it because it won't let me sign In and they said ages 2-8 Get it free i told them my son was 4 but they still won't let me In.,
Lov it,
yuc,
My kids were SO excited to get ABC Mouse and I was so excited for them to learn more. Instead I paid $50+ for a glorified e coloring book. Coloring pages are quick easy tickets and tickets buy cool stuff. SEVERELY disappointed in the app and program!,
"Money hungry my opinion, it kept saying ""for this amount"" you can get this added or this extra..and I'm(or now was) in trial phase . If you are offering a TRIAL period leave it that. THEN when the trial is over a request for ongoing service should then be presented. I'll continue to read to my babies myself,with a new Job and such I thought it would be ok. Byt I'll keep my$$. People pay attention even to the tiny tiny fine print. Read EVERYTHING!",
"I thought this would be great for my grandson who is 3 and he was enjoying it when it worked but it freezes,  won't go to the games he wants and is overall a complete waste of money and disappointment now. We are going to discontinue service and look for something different.",
"I paid for this program every month and in January after changing cards I 
was not able to access my account. I contacted abc mouse and it took 2 
months to hear from anyone and I ended up going to the bank in June to have 
them cancel my account. Abc mouse refused to refund any money to me. I 
would not recommend abc mouse.",
"Waste of time, space, data, etc. for a money hungry, ad filled, nothing new or innovative what so ever.  Save yourself and stop here, do not download!",
It's  horrible  you can't  even get in,
It could be a bit more challenging and not so repetitive,
I try to sign in but its not taking my email,
Terrible,
I think you shouldnt offer a free trial then direct someone to a page that only allows 3 options each one to be charged now. Its like here is your free month. Oh yea but to access that on the site you want to pay now with discount. Or you can choose no and just be charged the full 12 months at regular price... what a honest business....,
"To everyone complaining on app. UPGRADE/MAKE ROOM ON THE DEVICE. ABC mouse is large and requires a lot of ram and processing power to run it. My son uses ABC mouse on his next book tablet, just had to delete stuff and dedicate More resources to ABC mouse. Not hard, research before reviewing people...",
My daughter was bored with most stuff on here. It seems to run slow on her brand new tablet. The graphics leave a lot to be desired. She has other learning games with amazing graphics that really engage her. I also tried to use this for her home school. I paid for the testing and monitoring. It just wasn't helpful or engaging. It's a good idea that really needs an update.,
Buggy and unusable. The first two or three things were ok but well below the age group specified. There were things that didn't work and you were forced to go through them to get to the next stage. We simply couldn't use the app. We cancelled before the trial month was over. Not sure how this company is still in business. From people forgetting to cancel? Maybe the web version works.,
"My daughter used to play on abc mouse when she was young. Now that my son is old enough to use it i signed him up for the ""free"" trial. Yet, i paid for it even though i had no idea weather my sin was going to learn from it or like it at all. He's played it twice and has learned nothing.  The activities aren't challenging and are repetitive.  As far as having it as an app on your mobile device it's a waste of money and space. I wouldn't recommend downloading this as an alternative app to other educational apps that are FREE.",
With homeschooling I'm always looking for ways to get practice in without them realizing it. ABC mouse had helped do just that. I love the fact that it covers all the way to second grade. The kids come back with more curiosity to learn more about the subjects covered in ABC mouse. Love all they have to offer.,
"Program is great and I like that I can adjust the difficulty level at each stage so it doesn't get boring or repetitive. Really hard to find something kids weren't interested in. App does lag sometimes and doesn't recognize new password. However, like that multiple kids and settings are under one login. Good supplement/addition to traditional learning.",
Loads and loads hard to keep a child engaged when they have to wait so long for each activity. Registration was a nightmare I had to use my 4 year old's fingers to choose the correct year and parent option. Really not well thought out.,
During activities the screen goes blank and my child is unable to move on from that one particular environment. I know its not her tablet because i did it with my phone and the same thing kept happening. Its kinda frustrating since this is something we are paying for. Please fix.,
"Everyone complaining about ""free"", it IS free if you have Amazon Prime.  However, I would pay exorbitant amounts if I thought it would help my children learn!  My boys love this app & use it daily along side ""normal"" homework from school & workbooks from home!  I don't expect an app to be my children's parents, that is MY job!",
This app has been a great learning tool for my son for a few years. For the past few weeks the app and online it  has been freezing or the game or book goes blank and he  cant finish what he  is doing. He loves abc mouse but with these constant problems lately i have started using other programs for him to learn. If it  doesnt start working right soon i will be cancelling my membership. I wont pay for something that doesnt work.,
It's a wonderful program in addition to school. My son son has developed such a confidence since he's been working on abc mouse. I would definitely recommend this program to any parent who wants to help there child's thrive in there education.,
"We're still in the free trial, but will be cancelling if this app isn't fixed. Activities take forever to load and it force closes constantly. My daughter gets so frustrated because she's never able to finish anything. I don't understand how so many people can have the same complaint, but nothing is done about it??",
Screen locks up all the time on both my phone and tablet. My daughter gets upset. I will be cancelling.,
Want to cacel subscribtion taking money out of my acct. When i haven't been using.,
"My son and daughter loves this app. They use it all day and they can even spell "" Mississippi"" correct and can spell their names",
Doesn't work right. Can't get help. Waste of money. Waste of time. Only get it if you want to be pissed and angry and throw your money away.,
Our daughter loves the game but it is CONSTANTLY FREEZING on her so she can barely play. We are constantly uninstalling it and reinstalling it but nothing is working. We have contacted them about this issue but it's still happening. Really debating if we should just cancel our year subscription.,
The sound kept going so we couldn't hear anything it would work when you first opened the app then just stop working. Not happy with this app,
It gets a bit boring after a while and it  freezes up all the time on computer or the phones after 20 mins of that it frustrating to want to play anymore.,
Perfect for the kids. My 3 year old is obviously loveing it   Thanks again for your help and I look forward to hearing from you soon,
"Absolutely love it so far. And for those saying it's misleading that the app is free but then you have to pay, obviously the app itself is free to download but you have to pay for the service. Just like with the Netflix app, you're not charged to download, but you have to pay to use the service. Anyways, love ABC Mouse &lt;3.",
Dont like it.  I have unSubscribe and  im this  getting  charger. They have twice in one month.üò°,
"While I love abcmouse, this app is a bit slow and freezes too often. My kids lose interest after having to wait for the app to catch up after stopping.",
Its a good app the level of work for each grade could be improved IE less coloring more math and spelling but otherwise its good.,
Great activities  but occasionally  some of them freeze. A few of the activities glitch from time to time  slowing independent progress.,
It's complicated for my 3 year old I have downloaded more simple free apps that are less challenging to navigate through,
"Great program on the ""big computer,"" but the app is hard to use on my Android and sometimes locks up.",
"My kids loved it they are 6 and 3 and tend to fight over who gets to play 
first and when its time to turn it off lol. Also its very educational. I 
love seeing their progress everyday.",
I absolutely love this app my daughter loves it and you get to view your child's progress witch is another plus I have tried many learning apps for my two year old and abcmouse is by far the best I recommend this app to everyone that has a young child if you are looking for a great app that will help your child learn this is the app and don't be cheap about every child should get the chance to learn,
"A bit difficult, in my open opinion, for my 4, almost five year old granddaughter. However, with an adult by this or side, they quickly learn the ropes. I was particularly impressed with the number recognition game.  Thank you!",
My son hasn't played it yet just loaded it tonight but I looked at it and it looks cool,
I've had the app downloaded on my son's tablet for as long as I can. Remember and now we can't get it to work on any android device. We uninstalled and reinstalled and it saidnsometgimg about it not working on the device. I've paid for this and can't use it now and Im mad.,
I like the lessons but the app won't let me change users properly. So only one of my children is able to use the app.,
Ever since I was  3 I have loved this app and it encouraged me to pay atenten to school and I got i n to gate for 2 years . this is my second year in gate . and I AME in third grade.download the app,
It's am amazing program my kids Lear lot didn't have to go to pre school,
Doesn't work on most android devices. Kids are frustrated with frozen screens.,
It has so many options for both my kids and they are having fun and learning love this app.,
It helps my son who is 3 years old learn but it won't let me rotate it on my screen of my phone,
I CANNOT LOG ON OR EVEN GET IT TO PULL UP BUT YOU PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT THAT MONEY. EITHER FIX IT OR GIVE ME MONEY BACK FOR PAST 1 1/2 MONTHS.,
"They will scam you, do not download. They say free trial and charge you.",
"Every since I downloaded this app for my daughter, she has been IN LOVE!! Plays it Everyday now that she has her own tablet!!",
You charged me twice! Then i cant get anyone on the phone! I want my money back! It also keeps freezing.,
People after you cancelle your app they still keep charging you withdrawing without. You agree or not i cancelled mine on july 2017 there still charging me for the app i have proof that i did cancelled it don't used this app your regret it,
In prospector mine I can't go anywhere please fix it the game thinks its braking the rocks and I can't see the compound words and its saying random stuff it thinks I'm doing it wrong and I can't do anything and the pets are too inexpensive I only have a cat and bird the cat is in the house hold section it should be in our room not out in the park. Also their should be more chances of getting more tickets so again its too hard getting pets again lower the price . üò≠üò´üòØü§ë,
I have a 3yr old and 5yr old that absolutely love ABC Mouse. What they are learning from this is so much more than ever expected. I highly recommend for children and parents as something to do together. Thank you abc Mouse,
My son has learned so much in a short period of time from ABC Mouse!,
"Good app, but hard to navigate and freezes up a lot across all the platforms I use it on.",
"It might be great if it ever worked right. My kid won't go on because ""It's 
always broken""",
My child loves it and can't stop playing and learning. Awesome!,
I cancelled my subscription over a month ago and got charged today for the subscription! Be careful giving your card info to them!,
You can't do anything without paying so ya hated it,
Need to remind when your subscription is up especially yearly before they charge you. So you have the option to cancel before hand,
It's ok. Really not worth the monthly fee.,
It s eazy and it helps u learn alot it so amazing for kids,
I like what abc mouse is teaching my three year old disguised as a game,
"My grandkids didnt really use the app so I can't give a decent feedback one way or another except to say, cancelling their accounts is proving to be a nightmare!",
So I guess you need really fast internet to use this app. Because it never works for me but I use my hot spot. Why not explain this before sign up?,
My 5 year old loves this! I like that there is such a variety in games.,
It's a great tool for everyone no matter what age. I highly recommend it to anyone.,
Wont stay open in learning path,
My 2 year old is at a kindergarten level!!! This app has part to do with her being sooo smart!!:),
"So far so good! Just signed up for my 4 & 6 yr olds, they love it so far.",
You say it's for free but you're f****** stupid you have to pay for it I hate you forever made it,
This app has been very helpful to all my children.,
Great app. Just slow at loading.,
My girls learn so much with ABC Mouse We love it!,
My daughter has learn much from the different levels. It is a great addition to learning.,
the app is ok. runs slow,
ABC mouse has been a godsend for my grandkids. It locks in their imagination.,
App stays frozen on the main abc mouse page,
Consistently slow which is not what you want in a kids app.,
"I use ABC with my 2 ,3, and 6 year old AMAZING what a difference it has made!!!! Thank you ABC mouse!",
Good morning baby girl I love you so cute baby girl and I love your heart,
Shady business Apparently any membership is an auto renewal and zero notification is provided,

This is totally fun and my baby sister loves,
Very nice app and educational work for preschool,
Love this app my son's progressing a lot in school because of this app,
Awesome teaching aide. Thoughtfully developed!,
My 3 and 5 year olds absolutly love this.,
My son loves that he learns while having fun ~,
Could use some work I think it should be easier to work for the younger challenged kids like the videos and some of the games I also think your farm should be more Interactive and tell you a little bit more about the animals and maybe have the animals move or maybe have like a video of them and the hamster too should be easier to work with setting up the cage it gets frustrating even for me the game likes to freeze a lot and works a lot slower sometimes and I have a kid that has a short attention span and he needs something to react right away with so if you could please work on a couple of these things other than that I do love the app and it is taught my son a lot thank you,
I love the user interface and activities.,
It helps kids learn and once they start they don't want to stop my nine yr old still playsüòÅ!!!!!!!!,
My son loves it and he is learning.,
Children love it and so do I.,
It helps kids to learn before they go into school its AMAZING!!!!!,
Love this app! Grandbabies love learning,
This is a Great Learning Program.,

"Got it, didn't use it, canceled it. Still getting charged for it.....",
You shouldn't have to pay for your own child's education. üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†,

this suck,
"Just ok. Hoped my son would love it, but it wasn't appealing to him. That's not really why I'm giving it one star though. I decided to just try it & paid for 3 months. Apparently they continue to bill every three months. By the time I realized it I just wanted to cancel. It's a joke trying to cancel my account. I took the app off my phone long ago. Now I can only go through the app to cancel- not over the phone or on the internet. Super obnoxious.",
"I shouldn't need to sign up with a credit card in order to access some kind of basic trial app. Would prefer they have a basic free app version for those who want to see if their kid is interested, rather than asking for email sign up and billing info right away. Uninstalling.",
This is not a free app.... Not sure how it is #5 in top free educational apps. My son spent a total of 5 minutes on it and I have payed way too much money for him to be totally bored with it and now I see they raised their rates to about 10 dollars a month. Canceling it right now... Total waste of money,
"I never got to use it because it never stopped crashing! I wasted a 1 year membership, thanks for taking my $ & giving me nothing abc mouse! Don't get me wrong, my son loved it at 1st. He was excited played for hours, he was collecting the tickets then it wouldn't let him continue. He would go on to progress but the app would load...load...load he'd be sitting for over half an hour waiting! I didn't know he was waiting I thought he was playing. My poor child literally fell asleep while waiting multiple times. There's no excuse, so disappointed! You think you're helping your child just to waste time & money. He also played on multiple devices not just one so it's not the device.",
"At age two it's more for the adult learning, but some things my son can do which is great. One negative is I got a charge on my card which I didn't authorize nor did I get an email about it telling me what the charge is about. :(",
"I signed up back in July. My kids loved it. When I had a problem with my phone, I reset the whole phone. I downloaded the apps again. ABCmouse was the only one that was giving me a hard time. I couldn't remember the password. I tried to reset it. First the password I was trying didn't match the verification. Then it said the email was incorrect. I have tried contacting you since August to fix the issue. All I got back was a link to reset my password. I have been paying for the app for unused months. I can't find a way to cancel the account to start a new account. I feel like I have to cancel my bank account and open a new one. I read that if inactive for 24 months it'll be cancelled. I don't want to keep paying for an unused app. Please fix this issue so I can give you a higher rating.",
My son wasn't very interested in it after the first week. Forgot all about it and if you forget to cancel your subscription they'll automatically bill you a year later. Oh and it's impossible to get ahold of customer service.,
I enjoy using this app side-by-side with my boys. I believe the reward system can use some buffing up. Pertaining to tickets to task. The over all app is out standing my boys enjoy playing it every chance they get. The last thing I have noticed is the app is strenuous on the battery. This is the best educational app I have seen for my boys.,
"App to complex for small children. Account management is an absolute joke for adults as well.   Just an FYI for anybody to cancel, keep hitting ""Continue"" at the bottom right until you hit a ""Confirm my cancellation"" button in the middle of the screen.",
"They will continue charging you even if your credit card expires or is lost and you've notified your bank:  My son did enjoy this app for a very short amount of time, but he tired of it fairly quickly. He had not used the app for over a year.  In that time, I lost my my purse, including my old atm card, had to get a new phone and completely forgot about our subscription. Then Christmas rolls around.  I go into my bank account and see a charge for $59.99 from ABCMouse. Livid, I downloaded the app, logged in and the only way to get a hold of someone is to send an email and wait. I send an email.  Being a very impatient person, i go online and search for a phone number.  Finally find one on a thread not associated with this business, call and proceed to sit on hold for we'll over an hour before someone finally answered.  Fortunately, the person i spoke with was able to refund the money that had been charged to my new atm card (how that is even possible, i still so not know) and 2 weeks later, I'm still waiting for the funds to hit my account.  It is written in the small print that they will automatically deduct the funds from your account when you sign up, but i think it's  shady to use a card they were not authorized to use.  Then they blamed me for not reading the fine print, which i did, however, any other service i have ever used with ongoing charges had automatically cancelled if the card on file had be been cancelled for any reason and have sent an email asking for updated payment.   In my opinion, this company is absolutely unprofessional. I will never trust them with any of my account information after this",
This app is clunky.  You have to go back to the menus for every activity.  So so so many other apps that are better than this.  I think the number of high rankings are from paid advertising.  This app is not worth any money.  I regret wasting my $60.  It's garbage!,
ABC mouse has been taking money from my account for almost a year. My daughter can't use it because we don't have a devise that she can use it on. I've made several attempts to stop charges with no avail... Thieves!,
"THIS INCREDIBLE PROGRAM/APP IS SO AFFORDABLE, AND LESS THAN $10 SO ALL PARENTS OR YOUNG CHILDREN (HECK EVEN IF UR PREGNANT!)&HAVE INTERNET ACCESSORIES, then there are a isn't of the any good looking reason for not to try this with your kids! My 5th & youngest keiki is neck and deep awash and in terrible twos, but he is interested! I customized the avatars in likeness! I to our Ohana members too! I opted for the even better deal of $27.95 for 6 months, on top of the trial month. I even offered a friend whose 1 yr old daughter is advanced, one of my 2 extra profiles available for the basic app- nothing basic about it except the rudimentary facts. The games alone make it understandable that you ask for a card info. THE PRICE IS VERY REASONABLE AND I PRAY IT REMAINS SO, NO CHILD SHOULD BE PETTILY BARRED AND FROM KNOWLEDGE, ESP. NOT THE CORE FUNDAMENTALS! THIS IS PBS Membership is only $6/month: to be a Member of Nurturing Kindness and Moral Compass along with the benefits of Jim Henson!!! I grew up on sesame and street, and I still remember all of it! If You have the time and can omit 1 pack of smokes or 2 Starbucks Beverages, you can put the enrichment of your child into your room budget! üòéüòÄüôàüôâüôäüì≤üíªüñ±Ô∏èüîçüëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è",
"Just as awesome as the advertisements all claim. The only complaint I have is some of the games are so slow it makes them impossible to play (please fix this!!!) , all other puzzles, tools, and aspects of the app work wonderfully, and I highly recommend this app to every child of the projected age.",
My children love the app. My two year old request the app by name and cries when it's time to get off. He likes dancing to the music. My 6 year old also loves the app because he can work independently. The app goes through first grade.,
My kids think it's fun.  I think it sets them up for success in kindergarten because they already understand early education concepts when they get there.,
I love the content of this app and what it's trying to do but there are a TON of constant and frustrating glitches and freezes in this app that makes it extremely frustrating to use for both parent and child! Especially when you consider one is paying no small amount to use this app! And that this app has been around long enough these issues should be minimal not constant and consistent! PLEASE figure these things out or make your app free. We shouldn't be asked to pay for an app that is constantly glitching or experiencing bugs! Use the money we are paying to hire a top notch app development team.,
My toddler loves it and this is his main app. He loves the simplicity of the menu and the way he can personalize his avatar. He also can operate it on his own. Five stars!,
"My son loves ABC mouse, he has learnt so much in a short time. He is learning and having fun at the same time. He often says ""mummy i need to do my home work"" Refering to ABC mouse.",
It will not work on my smart phone. It takes up to much memory and requires high battery use. I'm sure it is a great application if I could use it on my phone for tutoring purposes.  Nor what I can use so how do I cancel during my free trial.,
"The app is so boring, not interesting it keeps doing the same activity for every letter, you have to do many clicks to go back or to go forward.  Difficult for a child to engage with it.",
"My daughter loves this game.  She's doing very well. I didn't like the idea of paying for this, but I'm definetly glad I did",
"It's absolutely fake it just took money from me that was supposed to be a free trial,then refused to let me cancel my subscription.",
"Load time between games is way to long for a young child. Need to badly scale app to a faster server. In two days of using this app, it shut down 3 times. The content is good, but the app itself needs a lot of work.",
"I was charged, when the advertising said one month free, then I called them and was on hold for 40 minutes and they never responded. To me this app is a joke. Customer service is bad. And they have false advertising.",
"I am having trouble renewing my subscription. I want it on my phone & iPad 
tablet. Thank you",
"The children love it so much. They are learning so many wonderful things, and having fun doing it.",
Advertising that they are compatible with iPad 1 version 5.1.1 and above. It is not. I know iPad 1 is end of life but I let my toddler play with it so it was important it works on the older one. Fix your wording on your site.,
It would be fantastic if the app wouldn't keep crashing all the time. I hate I paid so much for it to barely work...,
"It has helped my son tremendously. He is about to turn 4 and surprises me daily with the amount of knowledge he has. Not only is it super educational, but my son begs me to play it. He LOVES It! It's definitely worth the monthly fee.",
"Im sure its a great learning tool, unfortunately it does not seem compatible with my device. So i will have to cancel, a shame because i think my 5 yr old grandson would have learned a great deal",
"To hard to navigate through, also make sure you cancel before they charge you as they will not refund your money. They took money out of my account... I didnt even register the account for this app. Will never download again.",
It download fine then i created a account put my card information in it took fot the 30 day trial it's 4 steps got to fourth step it wont let me confirm i can't click on anything so i did everything over nothing change,
"Love, love, love this app! All 3 of my children have used it since they were 2. Very educational and fun!",
"I had to delete 4 of my apps to download this just so i could cancel my subscribtion and it wouldnt let me do anything unless I downloaded this app, when my kids tried to use it it constantly froze, never got to play any games",
My three year old love that I can have ABC Mouse on my phone so she doesn't have to be sitting behind the computer and can play on it.,
"You want to help kids learn but you ask for money, something I would do.",
"I love it is very educational for me,because im a kid ugh doy don't say this is boring it is fun just like a game it is just different it has thousands of games:)‚ù§‚ù§",
"Constantly not working,  which is awesome when a four year old is using it.",
It has helped my niece/daughter within just being on a few times in one week.,
Downloaded on a tablet it will not work.. App freezes and can not get money back,
Did you forget to optimize it for tablets because since the last update now it doesn't work anymore,
First of all they charged my account and I didn't even sign up with them. I want my money back asap! Completely B's,
You have to pay I downloaded this for my little brother so I hate it upgrade it to,
Does not work right .... the app keeps on freezing I have to close the app all the time ... if you can't fix this problem I will have to cancel my subscription,
My son Love's this app but I'm having problems with it keeps freezing on us and slows down.I've only had the problem for a few days but I'm stuck on the level ever since because he has to do all of them to continue on please fix this!!!!,
Paid for the app. It opens in a blank black screen. Can't  even use it.,
I HATE IT. I deleted  3 of my games for it!,
My grandkid love it!  It is easy to navigate for them and I can just over see.,
I'm trying to unsubscribe and they are making it impossible. Sheesh,
My 4 year old son loves this and has learned so much,
This app actually works! Its great for both of my kids and they are excelling fast! Love this app!,
We liked the computer version...downloaded the app and it froze 5 minutes in and won't work:(,
Nice app. Child used from age 3-4 enjoyed it very much,
it's not for 2 year olds like it says. and you can not get on many devices,
My grandkids love ABC Mouse. It is a awesome learning tool.,
My 4yr old loves it and it has helped out alot,
Love it. My son is learning so much and has a blast doing it.,

Perfect for ages 3-6yo. My 4yo loves it,

"My daughter Love's it, as a general is good app, it has games, math, reading, songs, art, and so much fun to do.",
Love it my daughter loves all the games,
I appreciate the activities my cousins occupy themselves with.,

This app is very educational and fun,
Essential to any family that takes learning seriously,
Mmm kinda loved it but mostly ok,
Great educational tool. Easy for the kid to use.,

Fun for kids but WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.,
i love it so much to fun and to sexy,
It's great has helped my children,
My baby sitter love's this keep it up,
Scam!!!!!! they would promote Free for 30 days but will over charge you.,
It took 8 dollars every month,
It freezes ALL the time & doesn't load correctly!!,
My daughter loves ABCmouse.,
This is the best game in the worldüòÅ,
The app would not load on my device,
It's great my son loves it.,
Amazing way for a child to learn!,

"So I'm writing this review to hopefully clear up the new issues since the last update. My 4 year old used to love this app and mastering math but since the last update they're not working correctly. I now have to log in everytime we open the app, which means my son can't just get on and learn, and it keeps kicking us out of the app. Please fix these issues or reach out and let me know how I can fix them.",
There are still some bugs to workout. It crashes more than I'd like. Sometimes we can't get on the app at all. It wont load. Plus there is a password protection that the desktop version has that doesn't apply on the app so my kids run through their tickets. But this program is A TRUE BLESSING. I homeschool and one of my kids uses this for school mainly due to developmental delay issues from hydrocephalus. She can't write so doing her work on a device is paramount to her learning.,
"I started using with my 16 month old who is now 18 months old. The content is very entertaining for him so much that it keeps him interested for a long enough time despite his currently short attention span. It also helps to reinforce what we teach him.  Apart from this, it keeps him entertained while he is restrained in his car seat for longer rides. As he gets older it's my hope that it would hold his interest for a longer time given that he will have more skills to be interactive with the program. The monthly cost is definitely not inhibitive.",
App dosent work its so slow weather on my computer or phone I'd love to use it with my son but his attention.goes to fast for a slow app. Sorry ill update once this is fixed ... I would also like to cancel my member ship since my son is not engaged,
Both my 2yo and 6yo boys find this app unappealing and boring. I tried to get them to use the app several different occasion but With no success.  I wish they would have more interesting interactions and characters.,
"Trying to cancel membership, yet all it wants me to do is download the app. So I download the app so I can write a review. Not worth the money, waste of money and time. I taught my son more in 10 minutes, then this website did in 30 minutes. I also don't want my son in front of a computer at 5 years old for 30 minutes to an hour, to learn nothing! All I want is to discontinue my membership!!! I wouldn't have wrote a review, until you made me download the app!!! Trust me, it's easier to sit down and teach your child, than to have this program steal your money!!!",
The app was great until it started to crash every time my son opened a new lesson. I hope they give refunds,
I hate it. Freezes on start up. Tried 3 different tablets/phones. I wish it were worth more than 1 star but it's not,
"This app is AMAZING! My daughter and I spend half an hour a day ""playing"" on this app. I cant believe how fast she is learning!",
My kids love it. I have it on every tablet and computer for easy access. They will literally stay on ABC mouse for hours,
"It's way to slow and son gets tired of waiting and rather not play on the 
tablet.",
ive not been able to get this to load for over two weeks on my phone or computer üòí,
I love this app and how it let's kids learn and play safely and at their on pace. The only con I have is that the data for their progress does not update when they play on different devices.,
Great app. Bad customer service. Can't get anyone on phone for help.,
My grandson  loves school time. He's  2  this is the best gift I  could give him,
Amazing games and lessons.  All my children love it and ask for it by name.  My oldest reads two grades above his required  level in school. My youngest speaks properly at age 3. Perfect addition to home and school lessons.,
My daugther loves this app. She retains alot and she's only a year,
"Won't load right, all words on the app are little grey squares and it's very slow",
Very slow and repetitive my 5 yr old got very bored with this app,
They charged me from the get go it was never FREE 30 DAYS! FRAUD!!,
My child loves to play this it's like she is playing a game and  learning thank you SO MUCH!!!,
My daughter enjoys all of the activities on this app. It's a great way to learn and play!,
Both my boys and my grandson love it and fight over who gets to use the pad to play it,
"This is just a massive add app, what a waste of a download",
I like the printable paper work,
My two and four years old children love it so far!,
It is really good and nice and it makes my daughter happy,
The learning path keeps my child excited and looking forward to the next lesson.,
We have been using this app for 4 year now and we love it!,
My daughter loves this app we do it together all the time,
I love this app amazing for my children helps them learn,
Love the app but keeps logging us out. Really annoying!!!!,
We r so thankful to have this program,
My kids love the learning process!,
I do not no the card number,
It teaches me.,
Awesome learning tool for young children!,
All my kids love it.,
Got this as a gift for my grandson and they love it!,
I like the program and want to go through this.,
I love it's  so fun,

Amazing,
Pretty,
Cool,
CLICK BAIT,
I really wanted to like this program but it takes forever to load (phone and computer) and my 2 year old twins get board waiting and move to a different app.,
I hated it because my little cousin went to get on watch this amazing video and then it says would you like to sign up for a free month trial I don't have money for these kinds of things I'm thinking oh this is a free app how nice he's been wanting to play ABCmouse ever since he was a lot younger and you going to a play store hey it's free download nope let's have them watch a super cool video and think that it's free for them to play so we can just trick them into buying our game these guys are jerks and I don't ever want to see this app again I thought my little cousin was actually going to get his chance to play with ABCmouse but no sign up for a free month trial no we don't have that kind of money jerks.,
We couldn't read the letters on the screen. Horrible!,
My 3 year old loves. She already know some of her ABCs by sight,
So like it but since getting app it will freeze up and the screen is black.  Have to uninstall and reinstall but doesnt last long.  Whats wrong?,
It a really good learning my son loves it,
The best 4 my 4 babies,
Use with Granddaughter and it has been life changing.,
Its impossible to cancel!!,
Love it!!!,
Great,
Not Free,
Omg üòçüëçüëçüòç,

NOT FREE!!!!!,

"Not a fan of placing my child in front of a tablet, phone, or computer but if i do this is a good app. I only wish i could use all the content while in airplane mode.",
"Very disappointed, crashes often does NOT teach anything. More educational value from learning toys at walmart. Bad interface, not really much to make a 60 dollar fee worth it.",
My daughter loves this app and learns new things everytimd she plays it,
Helpful and fun for my granddaughter.,
Good game,
Very good,
Awesome,
"Even though my child did not use the app & my 30 trial was over, the concept itself is amazing. I would still suggest this to anyone to at least try with their child(ren). Also their customer service is very prompt in getting back to you. I was always emailed back with in the hour of asking a question or solving a problem.",
My kids weren't to into it so I deleted the app and forgot to cancel it thats fine my bad. So when I realized it had been 1.5 years. I went to cancel it thats where the 1 star comes from. It took forever you have to download the app logon go to this place and that click through begger page after begger page. It wasted so much of my time. You got 1.5 years of my money for free. Don't make me spend an hour cancelling instead maybe send me some smoked salmon and a thank you card. I mean if i got paid for a year an half and didnt have to do anything i wouldnt ask for anything more. I would just say sweet that was some easy money and send them some salmon.,
"I like how it tells you that the first month is free. Yet it demands a credit card number, like I don't even get to try it out to see how I like it. Real smart abc mouse. Sorry but I'm not giving you my card number until I know what we're really purchasing. My little sister was really excited.",
"App doesn't work and is as broken as the website When i open the app, i get the starting animation with the logo and then nothing at all. Just a box telling me that I'm connected to the internet, which when pushed, goes away and then comes back 30secs later.",
My kids like it. My 4 year old is doing very well with it. My 7 year old gets a little uninterested sometimes. He really likes the spellingcity site. I would like it more if you incorporated some of what the spelling city site has into abc mouse also more math,
"Don't waste your time downloading this app it is not free, you have to put in a credit card, can't even try it first. Extremely disappointing especially because I've been wanting to try it only the to feel tricked",
The idea is great but the app is terrible. Freezes and crashes all the time. Can't even use what I'm paying for.,
"My kids love it, my three-year-old which has been playing since she was 2 
year old can now sing the ABCs . Can even read some of the words that come 
up on commercials. She even count from 1 to 10 and corrects her brother and 
sister witch is in Pre-K and kindergarten. They don't play as often, but 
I'm trying to get them interested I think she's a really big help in this. 
I'm really amazed at what she can do now.",
Hate the app first of all the no ads thing and the other thing lerning BLAH üôà  NOOBS WHO MADE THIS APP,
Peace of garbage app. Get it working you jokers or give my money back. I paid for a year and can not even get it working on my tablet.,
App looks and feels outdated. It was probably a revolutionary app 10 years ago but they didn't bother to keep up with the new tech.,
"Love the games and songs. However, we have come across several glitches with the app both on the iPhone and Android.",
"All 3 kids can't be on tablets and use it at the same time. Thought it was the wifi connection, however, everyone in the house can be on wifi at the same time using and doing various different things and we don't have a problem",
Its very good for my babysister cuase she's about to go to school and I want her to be smart.,
"My 4 year old has been playing for over a year and he loves it. It keeps his interest and I can see his growth in counting and identifying colors, animal, shapes, and in many other ways.",
I love it when the app is working properly! Haven't been able to pull it up in 3 days! My daughter could play for hours and hours and never get bored.,
Works great on computer. Trash on mobile. Won't be using app ever again.,
My son can't wait to come home from school to see what's new to do he really  enjoyed the abc mouse it help him alot thanks ABC mouse,
Shouldn't be labeled as free when it makes you pay after 30 days! Very deceiving!,
"Son loves it. And he's Autistic, and he's talking way more especially with the help of his school. Thanks ABC Mouse. Best investment in my child's life :)",
It works for  a couple  minutes and freezes up and I end up with a sad chips.,
Lately it has been having problems. It gets stuck  on some of the levels.,
People or kids learn fast it is fun for my son he said that he has a lot of fun on the first day he nows the ancient the 123 he had a lot of fun and the fun keeps on going on.,
Love the idea but it's not free. Stop false advertising!,
"Just bought app for my daughter, so will see what happen",
My baby sister is smart but she's still young (a little over a year) I want to start her education early and when I download this app she LOVES it. She is doing amazing now! Thank you!,
A little hard to navigate.,
It is awesome I used it for tutoring is was really good he learned a lot,
Not everthing works on it... please put the songs back on that do not work.,
My kids love it and they're learning a lot!,
I think this program is really good to help the kids succed in their learning school.,
"Great for my friends grand daughter 1st grader,.",
Don't ever download this app they suck i wish i could give no stars,
I love it and so does my daughter,
What I think is that this is a great game for kids to start early.,
I have two words for this; Love It!,
My grandkids love it and are excited about ABC school as they call it.,
It was alsome it helps my kid so much,
Amazing opportunity for young ones to get a head start.,
My kids love and they learn so much.,
Works great on my phone but sucks on my kindle,
This is the best learning game for kids,
Said phone app is free and it's not,
a little slow but great for learning,
ABC mouse has really boosted my granddaughter education,
Can't cancel without an act of congree,
Its great for my kids of different ages.,
Doesnt even load... what a waste of money,
The resolution in android phone is very poor. We can barely read anything written out there.,
"My children like this app. But the app won't load.. it say ""Hurray! Your internet connection has reconnected"" but it won't work!! please fix!",
Video for Level 7 Lesson 3 won't play,
I like it because it is kid froendly.,
Great learning experience for children!,
"Not a good service  !!!!!!!!!   It takes for ever to log in , something so simple you guys make so complicated  , not happy at all  !!!!!!!!!!!!",
My daughters Taylor and faith. Are in kindergarten they have lerned so much for the last to months. And the results are outstanding i love abc mouse and i have a son now and can't.

School,
My daughter has been using ABC Mouse for over a year. It has been great for her as most other aps are not challenging enough for her. She loves to learn and this has been a great tool for her.,
"I think it is a gret learning tool to get engaged. But at the same that I wajt my child on it,it is bad for your brain looking at a screen",
"Love the app very educational, but my kindergartener made it to level 5 and the first block won't load the video for him to watch. So he is unable to move on.",
Game is currently not operating correctly. I keep getting a message saying I've reconnected but it won't push pass the home screen. What's going on. Just started happing today.,
I love watching my son whom recently turned 3 get excited about being on ABC Mouse. He just lights up and it keeps him busy for hours.,
"We used to love this app, but recently it stopped working on our tablet, no matter what we do. We have the updated version also.",
My daughter loves this app. Also i love how they reward tickets to the child after progress has been made. I love being able to track my childs progress.,
My children love this app! It's such a fun way for kids to learn and parents can be involved too.,
Paid for it and downloaded...... Quite irritated that I just paid for a subscription that does not worküò°,
Cannot get any songs to play online and offline,
This is the best $8 I spend every month. My daughter isn't even 3 yet and she is already level 1! I love this app!,
Love this app! Helps and reinforces what my child is learning in the classroom.,
My daughter has learned so much just in the amount of time she's been in here 5 mo. Am very pleased with all the books she can choose to read !!! And so much more  Thanks ABC MOUSE !!!,
The applications run extremely slow,
My son loves this app! We work on it every morning before school!,
I love ABC Mouse because  it's a fun website where your  kids can learn and  have fun,
My daycare loves ABCmouse. Most of my children going to gifted right away.,
Helped my 3 year old count and learn her alphabet letters!!üòä,
It's a really good learning program for the little ones highly recommend it,
I love this game now make more games like this thanks for making it,
ABC mouse is great for children not learning well in a classroom.,
Love the app my kids do too.  It's very educational.,
ABC mouse stores Your credit Card details and automatically charges without informing you whether you want to continue or not,
It needs more stuff on there.,
I love the app but it does not work well on my sons tablet.,
Learning is important to the world. God bless you abundantly.,
Never gets past first screen -galaxy tab e,
Thank u my lil guys love this app,
Learned so much in such a short amount of time!,
Amazing.  Best learning tool by far.  Keeps them engaged.  Better than any standardized curriculum.  I Love it...They love it...And their learning!!,
It's wonderful for kids my kids love it,
My kids love this so much and they learn so much!!!,
It's slow and it lags,
It is very educational my daughter love's it,
My grandson love the puzzles.,
Abcmouse is perfect for kids to learn.,
Great App and my kindergartener loves it. Thanks,
App store said it was free and it is NOT.,
This is a great educational tool!,
My daughter asks to use it by name...,
Has everything you need for pre-k kids and up.üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,
My son adores this app!,
So!! Good for my kids,
Lots of bugs!,
I. Love.  ABC. Mous        W üòª,
We love this APP!!,

Excellent,
Just cancel it!,
This helps me,
Like,
Nooocb,
Will not pay for this,
"My problem wasn't necessarily with the learning program, it was with ABC Mouse's practices. They constantly sent me email about special deals. Finally they sent me an email about 2 months for free. It sounded like a great deal so I finally signed up. I entered my credit card info and they charged my card right away. Shady practices. In my opinion, this is theft. They stole my money. They didn't have permission to withdraw money from my account until after 2 months of free learning.",
"This is not age appropriate. The range of 2-4 or 2-5 for some or most of the activities is too advanced. It should be sold as 3 or 4 and up. My two year old does not need to know and cannot grasp the details of a particular animal's geographic location, habitat, eating habits, etc....",
Pretty lame that you have to enter credit card info just to try it out. They should just have a trial that runs out after so long and won't allow u to sign in again after that. I wonder how many people they've suckered out of money because they forgot to cancel the trial. Slick... but not at all cool.,
"My kids love this app! But the problem is it keeps crashing or it won't load after one of them has been doing some of the lessons. I would give it more stars, but my kids aren't able to be on very long at a time because of the issues with it loading.",
"We have used this very lightly, mostly bc the version we utilize most is intended for phones, not tablets. Not sure why these kinds of issues haven't been ironed out yet? A decent tool for her to play and learn with, but lacking on the fine details. Whether the kid is 2 or 10, it's hard to keep a kids attention for too long (if 5 minutes) with this app.",
We used it from the time my daughter was 18 months & it was great! The app was perfect for her and helped reinforce what we were teaching her. Although now with the price increase canceled it and use other sites as it's no longer worth it for us.,
I have the free trial BUT the app freezes on both of my tablets. I definitely don't see a point in paying for a very unstable app. It's really a shame because it seems to have great content during the 2 minutes it actually works.,
Every time I try to cancel my subscription it crashes. I've tried 8 times. Today. Please fix this,
"I love the idea of this program, but there are way to many cons. I paid $59 sale price for the year, which was a great. To use the program or access your account you have to download the app just for it to take you to what looks like a website version of ABCmouse and have you login everytime on the app.  Also if you buy the year access you will be placed on auto renew, so make sure your email is correct and up to date so you receive you billing notifications.  The program is bombarded with so much that my son got frustrated and gave up to play with something else. The app freezes and shuts down at random times, causing us to wait through loading screens again. This happened on mutiple devices which had a great internet connection and device specs.",
Doesn't work on my galaxy s8+. I can't change to a different child. I didnt go further than that because I need to be able to switch users,
Amazing.  All my kids love it.  My oldest 9 used it when it bearly came out and the upgrades now my 2 year old goes nuts with excitement when she hears the intro music.  I recommend it to everyone.  Always a fun learning experience for all.,
Don't get it. Too confusing. I even had a hard time going through it. How can i expect my daughter to learn.,
My son had no interest in this app there are way better ones out there that don't cost a dime,
"My son is 5 and he benefits, becomes smarter and has fun. You definitely CANNOT BE A LAZY OR PROCRASTINATING PARENT. With effort my child is consistently progressing  through shear will  & effort.  Thanks from a single fathers prospective.  ABC  WOW!!!",
"No customer service number. I want to cancel it tells me to download the app, download the app it sends me back to the webpage. Send an email and it says up to 24 hours or 48 hours to respond. My account is overdrawn.",
This has too much lag. Too much going on and not at all age appropriate. Also not user friendly.,
"The app is slow. The lag was frustrating for my 4 and 7 year old. I 
canceled my membership after about 2 days of use even though i paid for a 
full year. Hopefully they don't try and charge me again.",
They offer you a free membership for the first month and after that it will not be easy to cancel membership and payment as you will be redirected between links to find it. Although $10 is not too much ; I prefer to donate it rather than.....,
"My almost 4 year old loves to earn prizes and ""do his homework"" like his older siblings now.",
"Great, but parental control to skip a glitching lesson would be nice! Otherwise awesome.",
Not enough learning material for the ongoing price. There are better free apps or apps that have a one off payments. Don't waste money on this.,
My kids are grown but my grandkids really enjoy learning and playing the different games and reading the stories.,
It says that the it's free and once you download it you have to pay. It's sad you have to pay for kids learning apps,
This so good for your kid my son loves it and he is learning new stuff all the time I love it and my son loves it.,
All my kids love it and the extra apps it has best thing I've ever paid for.,
I love this app because I don't want to let go of my 4 year old to go just yet and I am his Pre-K teacher with this app and I appreciate abcmouse so much so thank to all the people who work with abcmouse...,
"My son and niece are enjoying it, my niece speaks just spanish and she's been making a great progress with her english thanks to ABCmouse and my son has become more interested in studying, they are both 4 years-old",
It's lagging on the tablet and when I try to go through the web it won't let me get in without downloading the app!,
Haven't played it enough but so far there is a lot to do and learn for my 3 year old üíï,
"Canceled my subscription and they are still currently taking money out of 
my account. ü§¨üò°üò°",
"Never worked effectively, can't even get on the site to cancel membership, worst ever",
My 4 ur old can be on abc üê≠  for hrs. He does so well ...and can honestly say he's learned to much just in the last 2 days we installed it.,
This company uses deceptive advertising tactics to rope you in. Do not suscribe!!,
Great learning app. Does have a few glitches that test the patience of both preschoolers and parents.,
"All three of our children(7, 4, and 2) are COMPLETELY different in their personalities, interest, and skill levels, but each one of them LOVES ABC Mouse and have learned and grown tremendously thanks to this app!",
My grandchildren are 2 and 3 and have so much fun. Very glad I got this for them.,
This compamy just care about the money....I haven't been able to use the app because it doesn't give me and option and already charged me 7.99 they dont even have a contact # for customer service,
Why do u have free on the app but once you download the app it's 7.95 for it? How about be honest and put the price of the app on it! Very disappointed! That is the reason I gave it only 1 star. Very misleading!,
"My son and I loved the ABC Mouse app until recently. We downloaded and installed the new add-on math app. Ever since then, the sound hasn't worked. I'm not paying for an app that requires sound to hear the songs and lessons and there's no sound.",
My 8/9 girl love's aba mouse,
"Doesn't work, just loads to a blank yellow screen.",
It is actually helping learn new things and l am in third grade and it is really fun and l am telling her truth,
Glad they fixed the bugs. Now it won't load at all. Very frustrating.,
it runs so slow even with the updated chrome,
A little bit hard to navigate but kids learn how to use it ...,
Love this app. It makes learning so much fun!,
Could be little more eye catching for the younger bunch but my boy learned so much!,
2 year old daughter absolutely loved this app! Plays with it every chance she gets,
Amazing app! Both of my kids love it! I love that they are having fun learning!,
"this game helped my 4 year old daughter learn new stuff I recommend this 
game to other people with children",
My 3 her old loves it. Very good educational tool.,
To play you have to give credit card info and pay monthly,
I use to play  this on my computer  when I was three . I loved this .  Now I got it for my six year old sister,
We have to use both the phone and computer because some of the videos will not play on the app.,
We like a lot cause is helping my daughter to learn more and more,
Very misleading that it's a subscription service,
Love it my grandchild use this program at school,
The app is worth spending money,
I think it is very beneficial for young children. I love it!,
A very useful tool in preparations for school,
Y granddaughter finds it boring not interested.,
Not turning on after last update,
I think this is a great app because it is very helpful,
Cancelled Service over a year ago and I still get charged 7.95 a month REDICULOUS!!!!!!,
My kids enjoy reading and doing the games on here,
This is very helpful for my six year old.,
My kids love ABC Mouse!,
Worked after i uninstalled and reinstalled.  Easy use for kids,
My son loves ABC Mouse.,
Good for my little kindergartener she's learning so much,
It doesn't work,
My two year old granddaughter loves the songs!,
Great app both boys love it,
It's the best app for kids,
"I couldn't log in to my personal account. Also, the app has a lot of bugs.",
I've canceled several times and y'all are still charging my account!!!!,
My boys love it. They are 4 & 5...they learn A LOT from it!,
Can't get into account to update information,
Easy to follow and get the kids involved,
Awome gamd and a great learning  activities,
Hidden fees that were charged without consent,
My babies love this app üòò,
This app isn't free. They shouldn't advertise as such. It's almost $10 a month.,
my grandson love it... it also helps him with his school work....,
Hated it. ¬∞~¬∞ i hate the graphics.-_-,
My child went To sitting on the TV to reading and  - +,

They Want Your Money,
Brest for kids!,
Fix your app,
It is amznon,
Its üòé,
i          Loue,
Amassing,
Wow,
Allsome,
You guys have to fix this.I pay almost 100$ for this to mess up every time my son plays it. He gets one objective done and it shuts down and he has to do it again. If you can't fix it I want my money back!,
"I think every parent should have abc mouse because it truly works and it's makes it fun for my 5 yr old son and myself. You'd be surprised what adults could learn, that was never taught to us as kids growing up.üòä",
Trash need to make 4 payments or one payment of 60 for one year. I found a lot of free games with no ads and great for my little kids to play and learn. Good try guys but too expensive.,
The app is soso but on the computer it's awesome we love it so much can't wait for them to add grade 3,
This app sucks. My son lost interest in 5 minutes. I asked twice for them to cancel my subscription and no-one emailed me back.,
My daughter has learned so much already and it's only been about a month. I'm very happy with the results so far we will continue using. $60 for a year what a deal!,
"My four year old daughter loves it.. she was first scared but within ,minutes she was so happy to hear great job and gets tickets.",
My 4 year old loves it and has prepared her for preschool in ways I was unaware of. Definitely recommend.,
Stole 100 dollars from me with no warning. Paid for the membership and no warning about password authorizing more purchases. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. You stole diapers off my child and food off my table. I'm sure you needed the money more than me though. Arses.,
"The app could be a little quicker to load activities and such, other then that I love it and it should be easier to change avatar outfits",
"My 3 year old loves all of the activities and videos. If you can afford the monthly fee, it's worth it. There is lots to do and really does make it fun to learn for children. It even keeps my attention and is fun to teach your child using this app.",
This is the best educational app for kids I have seen yet. My son loves the games and just the learning experience. Trust me when I say u won't be disappointed. A.C.,
Hoping they have for tablets soon bc its an amazing app for my child...but i dont want him on my phone when he has his own tablet,
"I have to pay 7.59 every freaking month and have to give all of my informacion,it looked intresting but not at all",
I like abc mouse beacuse it cool i love it i play on my mom üì≤ it fun give me         100000000000$,
My 5 yr old loves it but 3 yr old gets bored. It has helped my 5 yr old,
My daughter has learned so much from this app! Wonderful innovation.,
The app freezes a lot. Other than that my kids like it.,
I have used ABC mouse for a long time.  We love it!,
When I tryed to sign up it just keeps deleting my progress,
The app crashes a lot sending my daughter back to the play store,
It really help! You can learn and play games! Its a great mix of both. My son has been off and on it for 2 years now. He enjoys it,
Best app ever. Wish it had a lock screen but totally worth the money!,
My son's and daughters love this greatly put together app.,
App has froze and not worked right since the update üò≠,
Best learning app ever my daughter's are learning so much from one app its like a thousand apps in all guled together!!!!,
Love the way it teaches son,
The customer service is garbage and the app is glitched,
Can sum one share they info so i can build my kids motor skills.....,
"Do I HAVE to pay after the month? Ugh,NOT ALL PARENTS HAVE MONEY EVERY MONTH",
great for me and my child to spend time doing something fun and educational for her,
I think is the best thing for my grand son to learn.,
I'm haylee and it helped my little brother  and it's good,
My son loves it and helps so much,
I love how there's  up to 3 accounts! My kids can each learn at their level. This is awesome!!!,
I think that my little sister is learning and that it is just so great to see her increasing her skills,
It's great for elementary  kids .,
Its amazing forma all My little ones,

My daughter loves the letters of the alphabet songs and videos.,

L.O.V.Eikinn uhcchkk ungxgiil,
Funny,
The what,
"The app is actually very difficult to navigate on a tablet (computer may be different). Some of the ""games"" I had a difficult time trying to play. My daughter has been using this app for at least 6 months and we still haven't figured it all out. It's also very expensive, after downloading several free apps I've discovered that they are just as good.",
"Omg great customer service. I just knew my request sounded ridiculous but they gave me a refund, fixed my issue and we're very polite while doing so. Ashley was the name of the person who helped me and I thank her for her understanding.",
The program gets stuck and I want to cancel but there is no one to speak with for customer service.,
"I paid fir this app last year june , hated it and still beung billed because it wont allow me to cancel it.",
Wonderful app! My 3 year old loves it. There are soooo many different things on here and some really great learning tools. We just started preschool at home and use this to supplement our cirriculum. I definitely recommend it to anyone with a little one!,
"Update: able to cancel but I'll still be charged the full amount, so it's still BS. The app is not compatible with my baby's tablet so this is useless. Nice of you to keep m y money though. I will simply spread the word.",
The website is great. So far I can not switch users with this app... Which almost makes it useless. I'm reinstalling now. I hope this gets fixed soon.... And this app is not working at all on my Nexus 5... Opens to start screen and freezes.,
I think it's ridiculous that I cannot cancel this there's no way to get in there you're saying my password and my email do not match yes they do there better not be any more billing on this or I will contact you how attorney-general uninstalled your program not please do your part,
My twins love this app.  They both find it enjoyable and are picking things up left and right.,
"Not designed for a tablet apparently.  Super slow, glitchy, and my daughter is done with it in minutes.",
When through the extensive sign up process but video just go straight to black screen and text does not display clearly at all.,
I downloaded this for my baby bro he loved it so much my mom asked. If he could keep the tablet!    So I would rate this 11-10.  Hopefully other kids can enjoy this game as much as my baby bro,
Install & open only to find it's offering a 30 day free trial and then I have to pay. Wouldn't have downloaded if the description had made that clear.,
it says free and wants me yo pay 8$ a month. stop with the free lie.,
Two of my grandson lost interest in it just got boring don't get me wrong it is a good app but I think it needs more to it,
My son has learned so much using the app! He is always asking to play it. Even over watching tv!,
"You took money from me when you weren't supposed to. I try to get in touch with you people which is nearly impossible, then you block me on Facebook. YOU ARE A HORRIBLE COMPANY WITH CRAPPY CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK YOU FRAUDS!!! BUYER BEWARE, STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!",
We have had abc mouse for less then a week and already I see great changes in my child's development!!!,
I hate this thing I don't even know what it does and I am a kid so I don't know what this is and I think it's stupid,
"My Grandsons absolutely Love this, Fabulous learning tools !  Keep up the Fun of Learning. ;)",
My granddaughter loves ABC Mouse. I love it because she's learning.,
Trying to put it on my grandson tablet not working,
"It's not free, you have to pay for it!",
"Doesn't load, crashes and the learning path does not work.",
Amazing! Both of our kids enjoy it very much.,
"Lots of bugs, keeps crashing on the tablet.",
Wonderful app for child. Could use more guided activities moving from one to the next.,
I love it so like I like it it helps me learn or second grade,
This is a great learning experience for my kids,
Very easy for children. Makes learning fun again.,
"Both my daughter and I love this app... she actually bugs us to let her do her ""homework"" ..",
It wont load for me to register,
This is a great learning app for kids. It helps tremendously.,
My daughter loves it. She likes collecting tickets,
I like ABCmouse but this app is not functioning properly it will not load anything please have it fixed as soon as possible thank you,
Works better than the desktop version,
"4 yr old lives it; he just said: ""give me my abc mouse!""",
Logo comes in but then nothing happens.,
Abc Mouse is a good website for kids.,
Well I'm in Wisconsin and it might be not working for  you guys but it works for me,
My kids have learned so much.,
Great way to make learning fun,
Little rodent just wants my money,
I can not pay it.,
I like to play the. App,
Love this app and so do my kidsüíú,
wouldent work on my verizon tought pad.,
Very good learning app only thing is it freezes alot and sometimes when u press on something like the classroom or the my room button it takes like 5 or 6 times of clicking it before it goes to it,
My son enjoys the programs.,
It's  something  good for kids,
It's a scam not a game,
I LOVE how they put so much i learnig!!!,
It's a great app for kids to learn!!,
Abc mouse made me smarter and smarter,
My child used this in kindergarden in it rilly helps she was in a 5th grade reading,
I love this app...and my son do to,
It's perfect for kids,
This game is amazing!,
I love this program.....Delila,
Love it sooooooooooooooo much.,
I've started usinv this app for my child will update after a month lets see how much she grows üòÑ,
"There is zero free content. When you download the app, all you get is an ad page selling you their subscription service.",
My daughter loves playing,
My kids loves this app,
Awesome thanks so much,
Great!,
It's awesome,
Great learning applications,
BEST  GAME  EVER,
It good learnig,
My kids love it,
Kids love it,

Don't like it,
My. Dad,
Keep creshing,

"Free, until you download the app and find it's only free for a month. So you try to subscribe and can never get there because it freezes or crashes. I'm usually not the type of person who complains, but this is horrible advertising and an awful app that needs a lot of work before I would consider trying again. Don't advertise""free"" unless it's going to be free.",
"Not all kids learn the same way. Personally my son loves educational games. He is 2 years old and will close fruit ninja and load one of his toddler learning games on. We just started the games on here and already he is learning the order of his ABCs. Being a computer network admin, I can't wait till he gets into math. To all parents, don't just give them this and expect it to work. Update: Canceled for lack of use after 6 years. This was great and i still would recommend it.",
Downloaded it to test it for free for one month and I'm not liking it in the first day. I have installed on a OnePlus 3 and a Nvidia shield TV connected to my smart TV and it's not working on both. Most of the time the click doesn't work to go next or play... etc I'm using Android tv app from Google on my phone and a physical full keyboard to control the Nvidia shield tv and none of them is able to click. I also tried to run it on my phone and cast the screen to the TV but everything is overlapping everything,
"Really really glad I found ABC mouse. Always saw it on the t.v but never paidno mind to it. My daughter was struggling in pre-K . I decided to try it out. It wasnt free but I took a chance and it was the best choice i made. She took to the lessons on the learning path really well. You can also go to the parent part and it has tips on how to help your child. Tracks their progress and without paying again you can add two more kids. My son is starting prek this year and he already knows his ABCs and 123s because of ABCmouse. He also knows how to identify them which is awesome. Besides the learning part it also has the zoo, music, and fun things they can do. Its really an all in one app and you can access it anywhere. Im so excited for my kids to go to school and have a easier year because they love to say ""Hey this is on ABCmouse"". I reccomend it to everyone even with toddlers in daycare because they have toddler time to!!!!! Best part is they learning by simply playing and they dont mind. No fussing, no fighting me, and they want more!",
Dont market an app as free and then make you sign up for a fee. Thats false advertising. I hope yall fix it.,
"My kids all love to play ABC Mouse, even my older ones that are actually too old for their levels...",
Ive been trying for weeks to cancel my account and it wont let me. It always sends dead links to customer support pages and eant to delete  my account pages,
"App says free. Def not free. Even if its an amazing app, it should say subscription based and in app purchases. Not one part of it is free.",
"Amazing app, wonderful to see my son learning and having a blast. Has also greatly improved his attention span!",
I've changed my review because my daughter is very bored with this app. It does seem very easy for her and she needs to be in the higher grades to feel challenged,
"Horrible app!  It took my credit card number but it won't allow me to register!  It just says loading and that's as far as it will go.  This app needs work, a lot of work.",
you really need to do something about how often the app asks for the parent pw. every time I try to go to another screen I have to reenter the pw. has made me say forget it every time I use it. but my 5 yo likes it.,
"My son loves the app, but its extremely frustrating when it is constantly crashing! I will not continue to pay for an app that cannot be played!",
Cool I like it even though I'm 8 it's awesome good for ppl and I don't wanna forget all the stuff I learned do this helps me stay on track üôÇ,
It keeps freezing!  I'm not going to start paying for it if it keeps freezing!,
ABC Mouse is awesome !! My granddaughter love to use this app . She has so much fun and she learning at the same time . Thank you!!,
I like the product but my issue us it says it's free when it isn't.,
not a quick and easy app to load and just let the kids play,
Its not even free total waist of my time,
Really slow. Tried playing games and it wouldn't respond.,
This app stays on your credit card even when you take it off and you have to get rid of your credit card to get rid of it and it was hard to figure out how to take it off of the payment plan and even afterwards it still took money.,
App is very amateur and not worth the money,
Amazing!!! My kids love this app and learn so fast and have lots of fun too.,
Needs a lock so my child can't access anything else!,
My 4yr old loves it and helping her with it is also helping me relearn things,
My 5 now 6 yr old says it's just a little  boring and moves on to something else quickly after playing with the aquarium but I like it lol,
Your Liars you will not allow me to cancel my subscription I cannot get in contact with anybody I don't want your app I don't want to pay this nine 795 anymore I want you to leave delete it I cannot delete from this phone my computer you guys are frauds and you need to be reported to the Better Business,
Its terrible.will not let you log in.waste of time,
It said free but it made me pay,
I'm 10 and totally forget about until I saw it in a commercial so I'm downloading it for fun,
Great app for kids. Amazing tool for educating children!,
"Kalea our 3 yr old, loves your site.",
I love the game so much and its helping my daughter,
My daughter loves it and I love the she love to learn on ABC mouse,
My kids love this thank you so much for  getting them interested in learning,
I love it it helps you learn I know a lot of stuff but I still love it,
Great app just wish my son would go on it more,
Love the software but the app malfunctions on my phone,
"My daughter loved this app, she said it was ""VERY FUN""!",
A hard working app that teaches your child,
I think it is the best thing for kids,
Both my kids love this app very much,
It is very helpful üòÉ THANK YOU,
Educational and gives the kids the tools to succeed GREAT APP!!!!,
I think its great for the kids,
Best app my kids have used.,
Purely advertisment for a payment based game.,
Can't use on my other device. Very sad.,
My son is 3 years old andbhe knows how to read write and countüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ,
Even fun for my 2yo ‚ô°‚ô°,
Can't change users. So can only have one child work on the family device and you charge money for this????? Please fix.,
My little brother has a lot of tickets,
"Great,very helpful‚ù§",
It's not free. False advertising.,
My kids love it.,
Love the App but why is my child's name in the middle of the printables?,
My students love it!,
My son loves this app,
Essential for a toddler!,
My son loves this app,

"I tried the trial period but was sure to make sure payments wouldn't be automatically deducted. I'm pretty sure I selected this option if it was one, and ended up deleting the app before the trial period was over because I felt it wasn't working as well as it could. Fast forward a couple months later and there was a deduction made even though I was sure I had it set so payments couldn't automatically be taken out.",
"My kiddo is a fan! My son is four years old and he prefers this to any game app he has. He tells me jokes he learns and he can pick his activity for the day. The ticket system is great and although it isn't teaching him anything his preschool didn't, it is reinforcing what he had learned and helping him retain his knowledge over the summer",
"My 5 year old loves it. It took her a couple times playing the app before she got interested in it, since at first it is a little overwhelming with so many things to choose to do in the app. It has great motivation for the kids. As they complete activities they receive tickets and can buy virtual pets and other things. Once she figured that out she didn't want to stop playing. She completed 5 lessons in one day because she loved earning the tickets. I like how all the fun activities are all educational. WIN-WIN!",
"Bought this app in January after my baby turned 3yo...since then, we've barely used it 10x bc I can't seem to get it to work. It's very slow and frustrating. I came to the app store to read reviews to see if other ppl were having issues like me, and they are. I was getting frustrated with my internet (I'm a T-Mobile customer & I let him use my hotspot on his tablet) bc the games/songs lag SOO. FAR. BEHIND. that he and I both get restless and it's a task to get him to sit still and try to get through a lesson. What seems like it should take maybe 20-30 min, tops, is taking upwards of an hr. So now I'm wondering if it's not my internet at all (bc really, YouTube on his tablet works perfectly fine), but maybe it's just the app that lags and sucks?? My baby is already already pretty smart & advanced for his age, but he seems to like the lessons (when they load up enough for him to work them) & he loves getting the tickets for completion of a lesson or game. But I haven't even THOUGHT ABOUT letting him spend the tickets or go into his room and play around bc I'm just not ready for the slow lagging hassle that I know it's gonna be. I have a headache right now bc this app is so frustrating.üò£",
"I don't usually do this for apps, but abc mouse really did such an incredible job on this! My son has learned so much and really enjoys his abc mouse time. He gets excited and actually asks me if he can go on his phone to play it, to him it's fun. I see so much progress. It's 100 percent worth the money. I would recommend to anyone. My son was born premature and sometimes struggles with certain things. Abc mouse has helped in amazing ways to help him learn in a way he easily understands. Thank you abc mouse!",
"Customer service sucks. They cancelled my account withoit me asking for it to be. Then they withdrew two payments from my bank account that caused an overdraft fee. I get an email from a message board 12 hours after i contact them saying ""oh im sorry we refunded it"" no they did not refund anything and they refuse to reimburse me the moneu for the overdraft fee they caused by not knowing how to do their jobs. I work at a helo desk and i make sure i read every email fully and respond right away and make sure everything is fixed. Unlike them that are like i chopped your arm off so here is a dot bandaid have a great day good bye. This saddens me because my daughter loves this app and has learned so much from it already.",
"First of all the app is free but when you get in the app you have to pay? Why would the creators make you for your kids learning? I the're education is so important? I get it,  when the app gets downloaded you get paid. I guess that's the way to do it though. Lure people in and shut them down at the door. I don't care if it's $99 or .99, you will not make me or anyone of my family pay for something I can teach for FREE. All someone has to do is change that mouse into a owl and make an app for free...the real FREE.",
"This app is just after the money. My son learned nothing from it and was blocked from most stuff that he wanted to do because you had to pay extra for it. If they really wanted to help kids, the 7.99 we're already paying should be enough.",
"I love ABC mouse. But Everytime my little one tries to play or do her learning path it freezes up, slows down, or she just can't complete the task. We have down the flash player and all. Any help or suggestions will be gladly take. We have a Verizon ellipsis 8",
Kids are too easily distracted from the learning path. Very frustrating to parents. Funny how all the negative reviews are hidden behind the phone positive ones. If they try to auto-renew my account I'm taking legal action.,
"My 2 year old loves doing her lessons each day! I see that several have said their child found it boring, whereas I know this isn't for everyone, I wonder if they had it set right for their child's level. Anna is already thru the toddler Time and we haven't even had it 2 months!",
The app keeps crashing and making my kids hate this app even tho I already paid for the full year...come on fix it.,
"I would like to stop paying and i never camt, my son stop using this 3 years ago and i can't remove the account please help",
I have tried to cancel my subscription twice now and you guy's are still taking out the monthly payment. Please could you cancel it. I'm done.,
"Boring, could not get my son interested in any activity. Not so easy to discontinue as well.",
I think this will be a good choice for my nephew.His attention span is not good and he is slow at learning and very slow for a 9 yr. old.I know he will enjoy this.He loves to play with his tablet.I am thanking you in advance.,
It said compatible to everything I'm downloading toy samsung note 8 it said device is not compatible. Annoying please fix it,
"I'm glad I only signed up for a free trial. Only half of the app works, constantly crashes. I would have hated to pay for something that didn't work. I was really excited to try this for my daughter. I guess I'll look elsewhere.",
"They tell you its a free month but still charge your account. Then when you call customer service they are never available, but you can send a message through the website. False advertising.",
My son like the farm part of it. But he would love it if it had Dinosaurs on it. But all in all he loves this site. mother of a 3 year old,
"I haven't really test it as yet, I waiting until my child comes home from school. I just installed it.",
Did not fit my needs. There is no phone number to contact anyone about payment or other questions. I will not recommend this site.,
Slow on my tablet and smart T.V. I think it could use some work. My son gets distracted and frustrated when it slows down or stops.,
"My kids love it, but in order to switch users properly, I have to Uninstaller then reinstall or just only use it for 1 kid.",
It got subscribed by accident and keep trying to unsubscribed and it puts me in a loop. I don't have any young kids.,
Our 4 year old loved this app so much! She fell asleep playing and woke up wanting to play again.,
It is extremely slow. My daughter likes it but get really frustrated when her response is not being submitted.  Glad this is only a free trial. Dont think ill be getting the subscription unless this issue is fixed.,
Cancled account and I am still getting charged monthly. Cannot get a hold of customer service.,
"I wanted to try it with my grandaughter before buying it, free download my bottom! So it says free, but when you download the app, all you get is the advertising to buy it. Why would anyone want to download their advertising. So I'm uninstalling it, and will not purchase it, as I had planned!",
My grandchildren love this app I have deleted all other children's apps from phone and tablets,
"I can't properly switch between users. I'm stuck on one kids progress, when I change users only the name changes. The web site is fine, the app is broken.",
Used to work great and my daughter loved it. Now it force closes on every activity and we can't do anything on it. She has a LG tablet.,
I love abc mouse. But the app needs improving. My son does a lesson then it constantly makes him redo it over and over.,
"My son loves this app. I had problems getting him to sit still to learn, then I put this abc mouse mouse on his tablet and he has already starting to read short books!! I love it too",
My daughter is 3 years old and she loves this app. She is learning and having a wonderful time all at the same time. I enjoy watching my baby girl laugh and learn.,
Is there a way that I can download this app on my trio axs 4g it says that incompatible.,
"Almost every time I click to use the app, it goes to the advertisement of ABC mouse instead of logging in.  Only options are Logout (meaning I must be logged in somehow?!?!) or Sign up.  So I have to Logout in order to log BACK in!  Really annoying.  Daughter (just turned 4) enjoys it enough, but nothing extra ordinary, mostly watches videos. Not sure if it's worth the money with the amount of free apps available now-a-days.",
My 4 year old got bored quick. Trying to cancel your subscription is such a hassle. Don't even bother.,
Said it was for all devices wouldn't download to my tablet. It even said for phones in Google Playstore. Unfortunately I paid for a year's subscription live and learn.,
I was just going to do the free trial for a required offer fulfillment. but my daughter ended up loving it and I enjoyed watching her expand her knowledge of anything she wanted. So we paid for the subscription best $7-$8 bucks I spend a month absolutely worth it!!,
Our granddaughter Maudie can not wait to get home from daycare to play her ABC mouse. Thank you for making this such a great learning experience for her. Love it!,
"I'm torn. I love the app when it works. Since the last update, it's constantly been crashing.",
All four of my children found it boring. They lost interest very quickly.,
The App provides excellent educational learning experiences for my  pre-school grandson. Highly recommend for early educational development.üëç,
I'm sure it's very well presented and very useful however my grandson hasn't used it but one time and seems to get a little irritated I myself personally like that you have an academy learning program let's see what happens before school gets started,
The learning aspects of the app are wonderful! The fact that I have to log out each time I change users to get to the right profile and learning path is EXTREMELY annoying!,
"Love, the only thing to make it even more amazing is if there was a feature to keep the kids only in this app",
Once I turned it on my 5 year old grandson loved it and show our two year old grand daughter she try.,
Worst app I've  ever downloaded. Way to slow to use or even to setup for the kids. Like a 30 second  delay for each click. On a less slow day my 5 year old couldn't  navigate  the app. It doesn't  help if I have to be with the kids the  whole time.,
My God-Daughter tested above average after being thought to be developmentally delayed.,
We have this app on an LG tablet and it keeps crashing. Our son loves it on the rare occasion that it actually works. If the problem isn't fixed soon we will be canceling our subscription.,
My son loves this app but it's really disappointing to pay so much for it and it not be accessible offline...,
"Very frustrating when the website continually glitches, freezes up, and shuts off!",
I don't know my password  on ABC mouse. Com    After that is so cute in,
So far my toddler really likes the animals on here still trying to get them into the rest of the activities can't wait to find out more.,
The graphics for most of the videos and scenes are awful. It's really overrated.,
My 4 year old daughter LOVES ABC mouse and asks for it every day! Great app and a great price! Just renewed our subscription!,
My child is hooked on this app. It has helped her a lot. She is only 2 but knows a lot thorough the app.,
My daughter loves this app! Before this app she didn't want anything to do with learning. Now she asks me to play all day. Thank You  ABC mouse,
"THIS IS NOT A FREE APP!!!!!  Once you download and open the app, it is just an advertisement for abcmouse. You have to sign up and have to choose a free two month trial or pay before you have access to anything other than the advertisement. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME UNLESS YOU PLAN ON PAYING FOR THE APP.",
They make it way too hard to cancel! I was charged for a full year and could not figure out any way to cancel. At this point I'm just glad it's over. I will never use this program again,
I love there absolute guarantee that my son would advance and learn while having fun! We fight over who gets to play the games!!! üòÇ,
"My daughter loves this app. She was a little resistant at first, but the more she plays it the more she loves it. This app is very educational and fun for kids. It could use a few upgrades, but it is worth its price.",
Constantly having trouble with it staying on the right path. Have to uninstall and reinstall often,
Not user friendly for toddlers ad advverrtise.confusing anytime. Too lazy activies that are not connected,
4 year old loves it and no sketchy pop ups that she can accidentally click on üôå,
False advertising. Not free. waste of my time looking for a free app for my LO,
"I love this app for my kids. It is bright and engaging. I also appreciate that they recently added 1st and now 2nd grade material, perfect for my son. I love how parents can set the level best for their child.",
Great app for my 5 year old daughter. Wish they can offer other languages as well,
"They should give you a mo th free no debit or credit card, other wise its all about the mo ey and not our children like they claim",
I have canceled account three times and still getting billed getting very frustrated!!,
It helps my baby sis learn. She is  Really smart and she is only two years old .,
It is horrible when I was trying to sign up it kept saying email and address  right,
"I really liked all of the activities for my son, but the app itself is really slow.",
"Great way to learn while having fun! Also, helped my 7 yr old grand-daughter get ready for the upcoming school year over the summer.",
My twins girl love it this is very cool and they ask me when it's winduptime and I say it I'd already time and they jump around  and I give them there ipads,
"Love abc mouse, but this app runs really slow. It freezes at time and my kid gets a bit frustrated . Works great on a home laptop. App needs work.",
Really great program. My grandchildren  love & learn alot from abc mouse.,
My son is  learning while having fun.i have  managed to take him off the video  game.,
You have to pay  If you don't feel like paying and you shouldn't download this,
My grandson is teaching me how to use my new tablet playing abc Mouse! I am learning a great deal üòÉ! Mahalo!!üòé,
This garbage wont cancel my kid never even used it so now i got to find a way to cancel it,
I love it my grandbaby is going to be two soon and it reminded me of being in school as a child So many fun things to do and so colorful she already like books and she colors very smart. Thank you Rebecca,
My son loves it!  He does so well with this app compared to others!,
It's so fun for my 5 yr old. He loves the songs and earning tickets for his pets.,
This app kept crashing my son hated that and he just left it alone,
"My son ""plays"" on his ABC mouse everyday for about 30 minutes and is always wanting to do more. He is a young 3-year old. Reading has always been a fun daily activity but now he doesn't as well besides just counting. We love the app and its also great when I need a little quiet time to do my own college work.",
Current issues... Won't allow to switch users. A great app when it's working properly.,
It's pretty boring and it glichtes so much my daughter tried using it on my tablet and it was making her learn on mybothe daughters account fix the bugs then maybe I'll rerate it,
Best money I have ever spent on a program! My little girl has been writing and learning since 2 year's old with ABC mouse. She's now 5 and very advanced. Would recommend this to anyone with small children. ABC mouse has made learning fun!,
My boys have learned so much from this app. We all love the videos and games. Great learning tool!,
"For the 30 day "" free "" trial I was charged 60.00 and it doesn't stop there...I cancelled well within the 30 days just to be informed I'm paying until October.",
Hated it my child don't want to every Plat it I am deleting it now,
Love this app. I've seen a huge improvement with my kids. They actually ask to get on.,
My son is learning things i couldn't get him to sit still for.i love  that no matter what he's doing it's always teaching something.,
I like  it but why do you have to pay now I can't use it because my mom says no üò¢üò¢üò¢,
Best learning app for kids. It follows progress to increase difficulty level. Great for pre-kinder up to elementary kids. Best of all... It is fun!!,
It was very fun for me and I'm a Fithian graderüòÅ!,
Downloaded the app to my phone for my child to use and can not read the words as they show unclear.,
Constant crashes on LG-V10 Android 5.0.2. Don't waste your time/money.,
I like it because once I got to do it and my sisters doing it now and it's good because it's it's learning and I like it a lot like I really like it a lot!:),
Works great on all my devices! No crashes. My children can learn all kinds of stuff!,
"Whatever the purpose of this is, it's part of a false reward program. I've already been charged and can't get my information erased. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM!!!",
"You need to pay 20,00 dollars ! I hate this",
I  believe it  is fun  while  learning  and children get excited,
Helps Keira and they love it!! Great game to come up with!,
This has helped my grandchildren so . They love to be able to so many different things.,
"Learning and entertainment for my 4 year old, she loves it!",
The screen is blank. Idk wants wrong with it. Plz fix it,
Best teaching app but i haven't seen it has any spanish yet,
"My kids really love this app, and so do I. Not only are they having a ton of fun, but they're learning at the same time.",
Eat thing I could have done,
I Have It On Another Electronic So I Know How It Is. It Is So Fun Like It And It Teaches Kids Stuff I'm A Kid I Just LOVE It! Hope Y'all Have A Godly Day .^-^. &lt;3,

My 5 year loves it. She has learned so much from it but it has a lagging issue. Like right now it's frozen it won't let her finish. She had one more learning session thing and then she can graduate and move on to the next level and it freezes even after updating it and going out and coming back in. It's very frustrating when I pay for something and my child can not continue learning.,
"The app keeps glitching. After some lessons it says that my child had already done it 5x that day and doesn't give tickets even though that's his 1st time doing the lesson. Also on the bubble pop game the bubbles don't display on the screen yet it still counts down the timer. After some lessons the ticket screen freezes and doesn't give any tickets, we have to exit out the app and reopen it. On the story books and songs the words stop scrolling in the middle of the story or songs. Not to mention the room, fish tank and hamster cage doesn't allow my child to place the items has earned in them.   How do you expect kids to want to continue learning with all the glitches and for parents to pay for an app that isn't working properly. Either fix immediately or refund my money.",
"My son absolutely LOVES this app. It's his favorite thing to do. There are so many fun ways for him to learn letters, numbers, science, etc. I paid the extra  $3 for the assessments so, when he finished his Learning Path lessons, I tested him and then was given suggestions for games, songs, and stories that will help stregthen his weaknesses. This is my best app purchase since Zombies, Run!",
"I hate this app. It was a gift from grandma. It's literally the most stupid app ever. Totally not what the commercial said. He hates it. I hate it. It's totally NOT user friendly. It took me forever just to make the stupid avatar. Now we can't figure out how to even get into his games. The ""learning"" portions are horrible. What is he supposed to be learning from a picture of an apple with the word apple underneath and a computer generated voice that says Apple? Dumb! Grandma didn't need to pay a non refundable sixty bucks. He knows Apple starts with A. This app sucks. Worst investment ever. Don't do it. I can teach him more with flash cards and activity books from the half priced book store. Save yourself the trouble and download a user friendly free app!",
"I downloaded the app on a trial where they request your credit card information before continuing with the trial.  The subscription isnt processed through google play like most apps where you can easily unsubscribe via the google play app.  I had sent multiple emails requesting a refund and my account be cancelled, recieved no response.  After two months of being charged i went in and redownloaded the app to cancel my account which they make you select that you agree theres no refund of past fees which they will probably now use against me.  I had deleted the app because my kids didnt like it due to the app lagging and freezing.  One star due to the poor communication.  I will revise review if and when refund or response is recieved.",
"This was a huge waste of money. Songs are the same song over and over with different letter put in each time. My daughter absolutely hates this app. She would throw a tantrum each time we tried to get her to use it. Oh and the big kicker, they don't tell you the subscription is nonrefundable until you go to cancel. So unless you know for sure your kind will love this, don't sign up for a subscription because I'm now out $60 with a subscription to an app that drives my daughter crazy.",
"The app constantly freezes. After some lessons it doesn't issues tickets says he's completes it 5x already and it's only his 1st time, on other it freezes after completing we have to close it and reopen. On the bubble pop lesson the bubbles don't appear yet the timer still counts down. On reading and singing lessons the words stop scrolling on the middle. The app freezes when he tries to place his rewards in the room, fish tank, and hamster cage. My son gets frustrated. This app is supposed to teach children but it's frustrating him at an early age to want to learn. I'm paying for an app that doesn't work. Either fix or refund my money.",
"It's an ok app for children but to be honest I'm not impressed. After all the great reviews and many people suggesting I get it for my daughter. I downloaded the app and paid for a subscription, but it isn't easy to navigate and you can't pick areas to focus on. My child has a slight speach problem that is impacting her spelling and reading ability but this app doesn't really help with that like I hoped. If anyone knows a better one please let me know.",
"Had put Good program and it is, but one star because my main tablet broke, and tried using an older tablet. Not compatable, called noting can be done. How many children are losing out because they are not taking account to older/different devices.",
"Interface is extremely lagging causing our daughter to get frustrated and quit. It takes forever for things to load leading to multiple clicks and freezing. Sometimes pages don't even properly load. Our internet connection works for every other app including both YouTube apps so it should work with this just as well. Clean up the interface and it would be a great learning tool. Awesome lessons and facts a billion, fun games and exciting rewards for finishing activities. However, even as a patient adult that understands touch screen technology I feel that the system takes way too long to catch up with itself and doesn't keep kids engaged due to this technological flaw.",
"We have had issues with the pc version and the app. If you finish any puzzle on the pc there is no done button or complete and your stuck there, no tickets, nothing. On the app you finish one and get tickets but does not clear it as done and stays there, again not allowing your child to advance. My son is stuck on the pc and on the app. How is he supposed to learn. I have put in a customer support ticket, and never got any response back. I will have no choice but to cancel our account. This was never an issue when my daughter used ABC 2 years ago.... they added all this stuff to it and now it glitches horribly.",
"This was soooo not what they advertise and paid the fake testimonials say it is. My kids MASTERED this in less than a MONTH! Not to mention, they took double payments out of my account and when i went to cancel my subscription. They literally give you a run around. Just a load of caca for something kids can do for free from other educational sites or on YouTube. Smh MAJOR scam/disappointment! I HATE when people play on kids especially those eager to learn.",
ABC Mouse is amazing. My kids have learned so much. I never thought I would be so happy and excited to actually hand over my tablet epically with my 2 year old. ü§ìüòâ We have also seen A huge difference in both speech.,
"Sometimes it would be nice to turn off the constant repeating talking during a lesson, it just distracts and frustrates my 6 yr old. That is my only criticism in the year and a half I've been using abcmouse :)",
My granddaughter haven't had the opportunity to use the program yet. She just got her own android. My grandsons is enjoying the program and has learned so much. I have seen so much growth in him.  I would rather rate it after my grand daughter uses it.,
You actually require a credit card just to try out the app. Wow you shouldbe ashamed. Shady tacktics,
App crashes after every activity and is slow to load. My son is too frustrated to do more than 1 or 2 activities at a time.,
My kids love it but wish they only had buying options on the parents profile so my kids wouldn't try to buy anything,
"I absolutely love this site. My daughter is Autistic and has trouble learning, but this site helped her learn her colors and numbers. Her favorite is the puzzles.",
Love it but the Fish Dance game keeps freezing up and my son can't get his credit and move on.,
This a life saver for my 3 year old. Not only he is learning it is helping him with his speech that he is therapy for,
"Crashes every time we try to use it. Can't even do any activities , it just crashes as soon as you click on anything",
It keeps taking money from my account and never answer email and no 800 # for customers service,
My daughter loves it and we thank God for all the wonderful things she has learned. Thank you for your  commitment to children and making learning so much fun.!,
They would tell u that u have a free trial and then u would be charge. I tried unsubscribing and again I am seeing here on my bank statement that I was charged EC$287.00 my son has not used this app for years that's what hurts the most,
"Amazing app, after finally breaking down for my son to try. He just turned 5 and could be on this for hours playing and learning and the good news is he remembers what he learns.",
It helps to know people still care about learning and go out of there way to make great products that are here to stick around awhile.,
My son loves it .. He learns a lot surprised me bc he's 2,
I liked the content as a parent but my child didnt stay interested with it pass the songs..ill keep trying though. üòÑ,
Tried to use this app but won't open pass the registration page after it has already obtained my personal billing information. This app is horrible,
I deleted the app and still got a message saying an echeck was being sent from my PayPal to ABC mouse. Not expecting that. Also it was hard to navigate for my 4 year old and confusing let alone me 3 year old. Not impressed,
I thought it was insightful for my 3 year old boy. I think it will help him out a lot in the short and long term. It will certainly give him a solid foundation to work with.,
It is great when the app works. The app that I paid for shuts its self off all the time when me and my son are in the middle of a lesson so that is why I have it a poor rating. My tablet is band new and don't have that happen with any other programs on it. Education wise its great.,
It was great at first now it keeps glitching I bought it for a year and after two months it doesn't work properly,
"It has been very helpful for my son. Since we changed states in residency, my son was behind in reading. This app has helped him Excell in school.",
"Great, all the fundamentals of education for my two year old nephew, who knows his colors and now learning to count. Wonderful!",
I wish the app had a section for young toddlers. I started my grandson before 2 yrs and would like to see more age appropriate areas for him.,
I think my little boy and girl is going to love just reading these books I like reading them to toys and books just aren't for kids it's for grown ups too .,
keeps my children interested always something new they like that so they never get bored.,
Reoccurring charges after cancellation. Watch your wallet parents!! Better off with our leapfrog ultimate tablet.,
It's says 1st month free I would rather see if my kid likes it before I give you all my card info.,
Love this my three year old can count from 1-10 it's so exciting hearing her and knowing she learning stuff instead of playing games with no learning,
It is a great way to get kids to want to learn. My daughter loves it! She's only 2 years old and is already saying she's ready for school.,
"Got this for our 3 year old and it definitely isnt what the commercial says it is all she does is a whole lot of nothing. Never how to write, learn abc's, or math. Not worth the $$",
We use it on Nabi tablet. Other than freezing occasionally. It's great.,
App showing black screen. Not satisfied at all. It should be free.,
This is not a free app price should be displayed... 8 dollars a month,
My grandson really enjoys ABC Mouse! He's 3 and has used it for a year and a half.  He's asks to use it all the time.  He's above average in his knowledge because of this app.,
Useless Fakers...dont give the credit point but they do wanna know your credit card information...BS,
"Don't say an app is free then when you click to go in, its not! Stop wasting peoples time!",
This is a wonderful application that as helped my son very much. He has improved on his numbers and letters and shapes.,
Love the variety and ability for both my kids to use However can be very slow at times,
My sister dident know how to read and did not what to learn to and this has helped,
Best program ever! Our 4 yr old loves the tracing letters section and blew us all away the day he WROTE THE ALPHABET on his own!!,
The app for the tablets doesn't want to work most of the time .,
Great app...if we didn't get ads popping up and it didn't freeze up in the middle of a lesson or game  tried several times to communicate with powers that be but am told to reinstall ....getting old!,
Hated it I did everything right IT Freaking Thinks it is wrong,
"I think it is false advertisement because of the ages you tell, first it is everyone then it is five and under and then it ages two to seven get your act straight ABC MOUSE",
HATE IT WROST GAME EVER CHANGE THE EMAIL,
My five year old thinks its boring and its like pulling teeth to get her to play it,
The app keeps restarting after each lesson and freezes during most lessons.,
"ive had the worst luck trying to log in..so after literally 25 times of trying, i give up..now im having no luck with unsubscribing!!",
My sister loves this game now she k ows how to write her name and she knows her  number's,
I need it to help my son because he's very smart and I want to see if he is truly smart,
I hated it I did not teach  him wnything,
Constantly shutting down every couple of minutes,
My 3 year old daughter loves ABC MOUSE & she's learned a lot from it.üòÜ,
My 3 year old grandson loves this app especially the songs and the tickets that he earns for accomplishing a task!,
This game is so boring and you can't even log in,
I can't do anything except pay.,
Amazing learning app for my kids! I've seen so much improvement sense signing up.,
"My little man loves playing and learning, great investment.",
Would be a great app if it didn't crash all the time.,
It cost money you have to pay every month it is cheap and stupid warning do not get this app!!!!!!!,
I love it because it has been a long time  since I have  played  it,
The app constantly freezes and restarts...very frustrating.,
I think ABC mouse is the best game for kids and it is helping my kids learn everything first I thought it was a game  until I played it my self,
i think that this app is so amasing that it helps my kid and it so wonderful i could not have ask for any thing better,
My two girl really loves this and they needed this and now they are getting better at it !!,
"Very engaging and entertaining.  Well thought out, and easy to navigate.",
"Love it, my son would rather be on ABCmouse than watch the tv.",
It would be amazing if you don't have to sign up,
The game is very good it teaches  kid's abc mouse  u go game,
I love it and my son loves it. Enough said!,
Ok I love ABC MOUSE! So do my 4 kids!,
The kids have fun playing on the games and they learn while doing it,
Costs money and hard to exit out of program to uninstall,
"My 2 children love this, it's fun for them as they finish lessons",
My grandchildren love it and it helps them with reading and understanding.  Excellent program!,
My son looks forward to coming from a learning school environment to the fun learning experience of ABC mouse!,
Great for preschoolers and older kids to encourage and reinforce what is taught in school,
My kids love this app  Very educational. It's also fun.,
The app on my phone is slow.,
It is helping my 4 year old son a lot,
Need more for age 2 but great place for kids,
Love how it grows with my son and learning goals are natural to the app eblnvironment. Mr. W.,
My son is learning more each day and getting him ready for school,

You should make it so you can show the kid's grade and age,
Super slow app. Not worth the hassle,
My son loves this and it's a great way for him to learn.,
I love this program for my son he really learn a lot,
Best way to encourage your children's learning and development while they play.,
Everyone that has children should get this so there children and succeed,
"My son adores it, learns from it and has fun learning.",
My daughter loves it! Can't get her off the computer!,
Now I  know more math.  And  I love it !,
You have to pay money a mouth,
I think this is incredible!!! My babes will enjoy learning and this is very helpful for my two children!!!!,
Won't even let me sign up,
I luv it but it should be free because  no one  wants to pay to teach their child when  they  could get games like  it,
I think abc mouse is excellent and very educational!!,
It's probably like the worst game ever!üò†,
"ABC Mouse is the best children's educational app that there is, hands down!!!",
Very educational and very helpfull and modivating for your child,

Very interactive and it has a variety of activities.,
The app keeps shutting down can't even finish registration....üò©üò©üò©,
Don't label it as free when is not.,

I hate the first part i can sigh in i do not like it because I can not log in boo do not waste your time on this log in if u really need it then do what ever u need this is just my opinion not yours,
They will try to keep charging you even after you cancel the subscription. If you do choose to use this go though paypal,

"A fantastic and fun way for children to explore a variety of areas of interest and hone early education skills. As a teacher, I was skeptical, but hours and hours of time spent with my son playing games, coloring pictures, doing puzzles, and listening to stories (not to mention the pets...I am particularly obsessed with creating hamster mazes) has convinced me that the subscription is money well spent.",
"My son has been using this app for a while but since the latest update, it's been bugging out. All he gets is a black screen with the music playing. If I'm paying for his subscrition, the app should at least work or I'd like a refund because it's been a week that he can't use it.",
"Our son JT has a learning disorder, Dysphasia and kidney dysfunction. He is amazing, but doesn't speak well. Love is patient, love is kind. We lost 5 children before him. Then we found out he wasn't supposed to be here either. Love is patient, love is kind. Thank you so much all hands that were on deck building up this amazing site. All of your teachers and now whom so ever hands work here know that they want to leave this world in a better place. Thank you. JT's Parents. We will be happy to get back on the site when we can. Our old email address is no longer functioning. ""Server not found"" so we have lost many months due to having to get a new email account right after we signed up with you guys.",
"Biggest Scam out! This company is just after your money! Automatic payments make it easy for this company to take your money,  then deny you a refund when you immediately cancel and ask for one. I was a customer for over 2 years,  and my kids stopped using this app a while ago. I assumed it was canceled already,  but recieved a charge last night for another year.  I immediately contacted them for a refund and to cancel.  They denied me a full refund.Never again will they get any money out of me, and I suggest you take caution on this company and their policies...",
"Im hoping by giving it a 5 star you'll  be able to see this.  they are a crooked and deceptive company!!  It was functional and did what it's supposed to do as far a the app itself is considered. Where the problem came in was when we put my son in daycare and we'd just set up using the free trial, but it wouldn't let me set up without choosing a payment option... either monthly or yearly, paying yearly was cheaper so I chose that. We used it for a little over 2 weeks, I  requested to cancel and asked for a refund because they charged me before I even got to use my trial month... then tthey told me the would only refund me for 11 months. They are deceptive and crooked. Telling people they get a trial then making them pick a payment method to be able to use, and then charging it before you get your trial. Thats wrong, and deceptive!  Not to mention they still haven't refunded my money and now they ignore my Emails.  Gee ain't that great customer service!",
"ABC Mouse is very educational! There is Math, Reading, Science, History, Arts, and Social Studies. In each of those categories there books on the subject, games on the subject, art/puzzles on the subject, and songs on the subject! You can go in and follow the ""learning path"" or you can navigate to the subject you want and then learn through reading, games, art/puzzles and/or songs! My daughter loves the math games and now loves math & better at her math. She used to get so frustrated with math!",
My  son is ADHD and couldn't get dewan into this. Also beware that if you sign up for this they will automatically take the next payment out without any warning whatsoever I was not prepared for this because I was not informed that it was time to renew. So just be warned that they will automatically take out the payment without any warning at all when it is time to renew which is fine if you know it's coming,
Abc mouse is useful. The only problem is the glitches. There will be days I cannot us it because the app will keep shutting down or won't load any game. There was a time where it would not let them out of a book so I listened to the same book for a week!,
I need to rant about people complaining about paying. Have you ever seen an ABCmouse commercial? Its a program that you have to sign up and pay for. Do you really think a highly educational program that literally changes the way your child learns is going to be free? Hell no. This is the greatest app and program I have ever used. My son is beyond his years because of ABCmouse. Its WELL WORTH THE MONEY. WELL WORTH IT. ALSO you can alwayd request a gift card for one year subscription next time someone asks what to get your child for xmas/bday. This way you dont spend money.,
"To manage your account or cancel your subscription you are forced to download the app, you can't cancel from tje website. The games are all sub par quality. Some are good but most of them could really use some refinement. Most of the ""games"" are coloring or matching, nothing that they really took any time on to make quality. Yeah, they might have thousands of activities but they are all the same basic framework with different art. My 3 year old got bored very fast. His favorite part was the fish tank and even that, the art was so bad when you feed the fish the graphic breaks and becomes 4 corners of a fish instead of an animated fish eating food. You are better off downloading individual apps that have much more effort and  time put into them, it really shows. Sago mini is a great company to check out for toddlers.",
Love this app but since the upgrade when trying to log on it either keeps taking me back to the sign in screen or tells me my password is wrong. Reset my password sms still says it's wrong. When it finally did let me log on it just loaded forever and wouldn't really load the lessons.,
"It asked me if id like to rate this app, i said remind me later well it didn't like that so it just kept popping up over and over until finally i pressed no thanks, at which point abcmouse signed me out and wouldn't let me sign back in saying my email and password were incorrect but on my laptop it worked just fine with the same email and password. My advice don't download the app its a complete waste it's not even close to the same as the computer application. BOOOOOAH!",
"My 5 year old son wanted to die, he was thinking of chugging bleach with his friends. He swore more, and bought a game named ""GTA 5"". I as a responsible parent I left him alone in Russia. Don't download this app.",
"ABC Mouse is Perfect for any age! Start them young and watch them grow!! My one year old granddaughter LOVES interacting with the many learning games available. She has learned so much just in the past few weeks, it just blows our minds! Thanks to ABC Mouse, teaching your children and grandchildren at home has NEVER been easier!!!",
"Terrible app! The program is wonderful on a desktop, the mobile app is horrible. It randomly closes and then doesn't recognize the password to log back in. It took 10 minutes to get logged in and into my 3yo account by which time she had lost interest. I paid in advance for a 6 month subscription and in 3 weeks have never been able to get the mobile app to function longer than 3 minutes at a time! Great program when you are at home. Don't waste your time on putting it on your phone or tablet.",
It says its free then wants ya to pay thats bull crap. Guess i will be taking this app off,
I paid my subscription and when I downloaded the app I can't get passed the 5 step registration screen. The app turns off. This is unacceptable,
"My daughter is 2 and she loves it. She'll open the app and play things. Or even she is crying, I'll just open the app and she gets excited.",
"My son spent more time waiting on the different areas to load, that he became bored and put the tablet down. Everything on here is SLOW.",
"Old version was better. Now it lags all the time as soon as you open it. Our internet connectiin works fine for youtube videos non stop plus other ""heavy"" apps.. This is a waste of $60 dollars if the issue isn't fixed soon.",
"Truly an amazing app. My daughter loves it. She is always using it, all day and she has learnt so much already.",
Not free.. misleading! Doesn't allow you to do anything without signing up for an account or free trial. Could be a great product but I'll never know because I don't like deceptive business practices like advertising something as a free app and then forcing you to setup a trial.,
ABCmouse I know that she was going to but I wasn't sure if she was taking information and after having her on ABC Mouse for 3 weeks her personality has changed she's more vocal and wants to speak with my daughter is only one and a half and already I'm seeing the benefits recognizing numbers straight through to 50 it's made her sharper,
We loved this for about two weeks but several of the games have a programming error that will not allow the child to finish the game. Both of my children are now stuck and unable to continue down the learning path. I contacted customer service and have not heard back.,
"Our son loved it in the beginning, but soon after began to get bored and disinterested in the lessons. The singing lessons failed to keep his attention and it seems like the app itself isn't fast paced enough for him.",
HORRIBLE!!!!! I'D GIVE NEGATIVE ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE!!! I'm going to type in all caps so people are sure to see this and not waste hundreds of dollars!!! YOU HAVE TO LOG IN WITH EMAIL AND PASSWORD EVERY TIME AND WHAT TODDLER CAN DO THAT IF THE APP IS ON THEIR ipad I WASTED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AND IT WAS NEVER BEING USED BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T LOG IN!!! THEN TO TOP IT OFF IF YOU CANCEL AFTER PAYING THEY CANCEL THAT DAY EVEN AFTER YOU PAID 100 PLUS DOLLARS ALREADY FOR THE YEAR!!! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TOO!!!!!,
App is laggy but overall pretty good. Can't clean the fish tank because of the lag,
"Computer is better at abcmouse. I hate that you have to pay every month, because when I was going to sign in In saw the you have to pay $7.25 a month. I loved this game when I was younger but now I hate that you have to pay. I like it otherwise. But do not download this app if you don't want to pay. I deleted this app immediately.",
"My 2-year old found the app boring. The graphics are lame and content is uninteresting. Not worth the price, IMHO",
Worth the subscription.  seen a lot of complaints about the curriculum being too easy for their child but each lesson and activity has a difficulty level from 1 to 10. This app is also really geared for preschool/prek/kindergarten aged children.,
"Just downloaded and can see anything. Not sure if this is an update issue, or just a faulted app software, but it desperately needs help. I can add a screen shoot if necessary but all the letters and numbers appear as blocks. Please help!",
I love that my kids get engaged and want to go check there aquariums after they finish their learning path each day.,
Just started using so far no good. App stalls frequently. Will continue use maybe it will get Betta.,
"I think this app is wonderful, my two year old loves it and plays it on his tablet. It is well worth the price",
Both of my daughters (ages 3 & 5) love this app. They do the activities for hours and are learning more and more each day.,
I can't even download this app on my daughter's tablet I am furious. I can't even get a hold of anyone on abc mouse to help me.,
"I originally purchased this to supplement what I was teaching my daughter at home. My daughter could read basic sight words at age 2. By age 3, she was reading simple books independently. When she started preschool, she was reading at a first grade level. She has gained almost a year's progress. I love how parents and teachers can customize the program to meet the individual needs of their children.",
"I wish when searching for specific topics, that the lessons were more cohesive. They seem to be all over the place, and it's difficult to know if you've completed them all. But my son enjoys this app tremendously.",
I love the website so much.  But the app is extremely slow. It won't play  videos or songs and the kids must wait 5 mins or so to color a picture.,
FIX YOUR AP! Shuts down constantly! So annoying. Im going to cancel my membership. My 2 year old really liked it when she could actually use it.,
"Stupid that you have to pay for something that every child needs. Juat you create an app that can teach ypur child to read, spell and others. You dont need to make some parents pay just for learning",
My daughter has a ball with this app while learning new things. She's only 5yrs old and super advanced.,
"I have no children under the age of 47, no grandchildren, I had to do this in order to complete some questioners.  I don't want it. Don't need it and will uninstall if I ever get out of here!",
"App is always crashing. Frustrates my 3 year old. All kinds of glitches like with the hamster and the fish tank. Certain parts of the screen won't load. I've cleared app cache, app data, and reinstalled the app to no avail.",
"Both our kids love it! But I will advise you to begin membership with the card you plan to be billed with because if you change it, they will bill you twice!",
My child has been using this app for over a year now and loves it! This has been so helpful in making literacy and math more fun!,
App needs an update its not loading all the way and it's very laggy  it's not working right but I love the app it's fun,
"The App keeps crashing, so its hard for my son to keep up on it.",
My daughter finally wanted to play but different things won't load. She can't do any activities since they won't let you click them. Very sad,
I love the games and my son benefits from them. But there are many flaws in the app. For example it often gets stuck on a game and won't progress further.,
Abc mouse has been the best app for all three of my kids.. the only one ill actually pay for a subscription because i know its worth it.. LOVE IT,
Was fun for about a month then my children became disinterested so we turned back to alternatives.,
My grandson took right to it and everyday he learns something new. Wow fantastic app.,
Been on the app for over an hour niw and cant get past the registration process.  Now im paying for an app just so i can cancel it.  Cant imagine it being any good for my children if it just sits and loads while im registering.,
We can't get passed  a level because  it quits unexpectedly. My daughter  has been stuck on the same level  forever.,
My 3 year old son and 4 year old nephew are addicted this and I love it. The lessons are invaluable,
Great fun and learning app for young children! It keeps them entertained while they are also learning...So it doesn't seem like work!,
My 5 year old daughter loves this app! It has taught her so much in such little time.,
We love to watch our 6 year Olds eyes light up when she plays this app!! She has learned alot from it!! Thank you ABC,
"My daughter entered preschool this past fall and was definitely ahead of the rest of her class.  I attribute this solely to ABC mouse, you guys a awesome.",
"I can tell my 2yr old is learning certain things. I like it. She gets bored with the songs and some of the stories but other than that, she will play activities for a while. Nice learning app. This is a everyday thing now.",
The game says Free yet I am being charged around $11.00 a month for something my grand kids got bored with. I thought I had canceled the darn game but am still being charged. Don't say it is free when it is not.  How the sugar do I cancel this game for the the time üò§üò§üò§,
We are enjoying abc mouse more and more each day... the leading seems endless and the program is extremely enjoyable.,
Why not give a 30 day free trail without giving credit card information. To see if it's really purchasable I hear good reviews a free trail should be free like it says.,
Its saying. Installed but I don't see where to log in at,
My grandson loves to play with abc mouse. He has learn so much .I can't wait until he starts school. He is only 3 years old .,
If your a child and trying to get this for younger sibling don't get it it needs lots of personal info and you can't sign up if you don't put in your credit card number.Dont get this game,
"Please cancel my subscription  horrible customer service once they have your credit card information. I followed online steps o how to cancel subscription,  but still not successful.  I tried calling them and was on hold for 30 minutes! I will call my bank.",
I started using this app to help my daughter who was having trouble with her alphabets..now she knows them all and is starting on the words..this app is easy to use and very useful.,
"Worked fine until started using app version, now we are constantly logging back in. ü§î",
Good learning app.  The down side is that it cuts off in the middle or the end of an activity and it goes slow to load up.,
"The app is a great concept. My daughter loves it. Only problem is...it keeps freezing, making my daughter very frustrated. As much as we love this app, we won't be renewing our subscription.",
It's a wonderful program for even 1 year olds. I think that this should be Nationwide and in every school district. I also thank you for giving me the opportunity to teach my grandchild at my pace and at his will. Thank you,
Awesome help for getting kids started for school and for basic beginning teaching skills for everyday life.  Thanks for this wonderful app guys. Keep up the good work!!!!!,
It is very fun it had some stuff I couldn't get throw but I did it still.,
My 3 year old son learned a lot with this app now he goes to school and recognizes some lessons he learned from this app.,
Great app! I've used it with both of my children. My only complaint is that some functions load extremely slowly and can be frustrating for young kids.,
Anyone conserned about there childs learnimg. Needs to start bere and this will be all that you need for you child to succeed.my 2ur old son can count up to 10 knows his abc shapes and colors,
My kids enjoy this app!! I don't mind letting them play for more than an hour when I know they are learning  something new!!!,
My little one is 6. She absolutely loves this app. It is very helpful. It makes learning fun. Keep up the great job.,
This game is so educational for children it's fine if they're playing around with it myself and I believe that it's an oasis for children this is the best learning game ever my child is only in kindergarten in his nose to count to a thousand and all of his multiplication facts wow,
It freezes or looses signal to the Internet through WiFi on my tablet.,
"It is a great app....and yes you have to pay BUT it is well worth it, my 1st grader loves it played since pre-k and now my son uses it and he's almost 3. Stop rating it bad cause your device glitches after u pay, it's also available on the computer.....u know....Online? It's a wonderful game with many things to do and learn :)",
Freezes up alot. I have to restart wether computer or on the phone,
My two year old can now point out an ostrich lol great app! Worth the price! It works!,
"My 5 year old plays it daily. She does a full lesson & loves it. If an activity wont load, I'll  just reload the game.",
Major issues the last few days... Will not load. We love the program. Not a happy mini when she asks to us it and it doesn't work. Hope this is resolved soon!,
Purchase this app last year when my daughter was 4 before she started Pre-K. To say the least she is ahead of the Curve in the education area. She's already passed the assessment for kindergarten. And it is help my 2 year-old son learn his shapes and colors. Well worth the investment for your child education. Getting ready to renew another year subscription. No I am not by any means have the money but for my children it's a must.,
"Haven't tried it yet! But if it teaches the children it's worth trying ! And it's free, well I'm willing 2try4 the future of the children!",
For w weeks would not let s go past a lesson,
"My child is on level 4, lesson 72 - reading family and friends; number one. He has watch the video multiple times and it will not give him any tickets and will not let him move to the next level. Can you please help with this? This is the last one we have to do for my child to graduate to the next level. Thank you for all your help",
"I think you guys need to do an update and fix your bugs. I love the app as did my son, but it started to glitch,stopped working n froze when I tried to set my daughter up on the account.",
This is foolishness you guys need to fix it or o will shut it down,
I think I'm highly dissatisfied I asked my subscription to be cancelled and I was charged again,
"Great method of teaching even the most ""bored"" of all children. fun!",
This app is just great... I have 2 little sisters and one little brother who do this.... They all love it and my little 2 year old sister is already learning how to write lettersüòÅüòÅüòÅ,
Easy on the go learning that can be continued at home. My kids love ABC mouse and i love that they can learn anywhere.,
I love abc mouse but the app has no sound and no settings to help fix the problem,
Says I do not have a comparable device. What do I do now.,
It's a great app to introduce to your child at any age. Makes learning fun!,
"I have 3 grandchildren ages 2, 4 and 7. All three have fun doing learning activities on ABC mouse!!!",
"My 2 year old LOVES this app! It's fun for her with so many different activities to do, and I love it because she's learning all sorts of different skills.  Vocabulary, hand eye coordination, about animals, coloring, puzzles, and much more!",
My 5 grade love it she got it on her phone she still play it thnk you so much üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ,
Didnt even use the whole free month and i had to pay a cancelation fee and supposably its free for a month!!  Hate it!!!!,
"I love the idea of the app, however it's a little to slow for my two year old. :(",
It's great. My daughter has learned a lot,
My daughter loves it.  My daughter has learned so much. Worth the money.,
My son lives ABC mouse! He loves the puzzles and looking at the animals. He's learning so much.,
Educational  It helped my 3 year old daughter improve  so much... when I saw her grades that were amazing results! Thankyou ABC Mouse. Com!üíù,
I love the app but hate to having to keep signing in Everytime (up to 3x/day) on the same device. Wish there was a way of option to stay signed in,
"Not compatible with nabi XD, with 5 mil downloads , with each download requiring a monthly subscription I would think there would be enough funds to make app compatible with all devices. Canceling my subscription",
Great for my autistic son he loves it and has learned a lot.,
It keeps kicking us off. He loves it,
It is really good.when I was a baby it was very easy to use and when my sister was a baby she wanted somthing that was fun and easy,
My son all his planets with ABC mouse he loves this app so much learn alot from the app,
Love it !!!!! My 4 yr old daughter has learned so much already and she has a blast playing.,
My daughter loves this app it be cool if they added stuff to assist with potty training.,
There are a couple of glitches but still keep the kids entertained,
"My granddaughters love it. 6 4 and 2, something for all of them.",
It's okay. Neither of my daughter's really liked using the app. Found it boring.,
Great educational app! One of the few I let my toddlers use!,
My wife and I use this app for our kids. We are all very satisfied.,
"I never saw my child so excited and committed. He asks me  for  ""homework""...",
I think the apps is real good for kids of all age group.,
"Love this app, have 2yr old grandson already learning his ABC's",

My daughter loves and it helps her to understand things better,
Amazing app. My son is learning a lot and best of all he enjoys it,

My kid loves it!!!!!! I can't stop him!,
Boring and ABC mouse as a whole is a scam!!! Never again!!!!,
Not a free app. Deceptive.,
I don't like this app it not free for 30days,
Commercials. Are. So. Wrong,
Since my son started can't get him off,
Good app for toddlers and up.,
helps my kid if only it didn't need wifi,
"Misleading, NOT FREE",
Was charged when I tried the 30 day trial. Was charged on the first day.,
Not much fun.,
Absolutely wonderful for my kids!,

"I have hated this program for several years now. Tried it with the one child, decided to try it again and I still feel the same. Not user friendly. The kids lose interest really fast. Settings are hard to change. Right now it has me listed as one of the children and I can't find out how to change it. I feel like this hasn't changed at all to keep up with changing technology. The kids get frustrated with it, as do I.",
"Impossible to cancel membership. You can only unsubscribe within the app, but there is a bug that prevents that. They do not have an actual website to login to for issues like this either. Customer service is not helpful. Now I'm stuck paying 7.99 a month for something my daughter doesn't even play.",
Updated the app and now it no longer works.  Customer service didnt resolve the issue but said that it was complete. My kids couldn't use the app but they still wanted their payment.  The only thing that they offered was to extend billing by one week or I could cancel the subscription.  Guess what... with that kind of customer service I cancelled.,
"I love ABC Mouse. Games are fun for kids and educational. My three-year-old daughter has learned so much including letter recognition, number recognition & many more things. We just found out she's really good at puzzles. I think it's the perfect early learning website. We only paid $60 for a year which is a really good deal. We will be using this site for years to come.",
"Good content, easy to switch between children, although it's a bit overwhelming. Not the best for special needs or smaller children. They can easily press TONS of buttons. Almost too much work to keep them on track. A simpler interface would work better for us (one with autism and a 2 y/o).",
This app constantly stalls. The audio runs ahead of the video or the exercise freezes. It's not the tablet the tablet is brand new 2.4 gigahertz quad-core. I also put on Starfall it works fine and could be played offline. I think the ABC Mouse platform is a good one just not this app.,
"A feature I would five star this for is if you had a child lock, one to prevent a child leaving the app on a touch device without the parent entering a code to exit. I use this occasionally while driving and listen to make sure its on ABC mouse but somtimes he'll change it...if it was locked I wouldn't have to take the phone away and prevent him from learning more.",
This site dose not hide the education like they say it does it beats the education across the kids head that's why my 2 nephews found it so boring so quickly they have more fun at school than on this wedsite. And then on top of that it looks cheap and the cheap boring games barely work. I am just angry and frustrate.,
"My 5 yr old has been using ABCmouse for 2 1\2 years now. In the first 6 months he started reading, by 3 he was able to add and subtract. Now he is doing multiplication and reading on a 2nd grade level, and he is only in Kindergarten.  This is such an easy to use app and it really works.",
Would never download any other learning games to my electronics again after I downloaded the ABC Mouse app my babies  love e it. I have a 10 year old and a 2 ya old and my 10 ya old likes it just as much as my 2 ya old.. Tha k you ABC mouse for helping my child get ready for his learning ideas. My 10 Ya Old Has A Reading Disability And This Has Helper him more than what a school  teacher could do and that's a fact..,
"It forces you to use the app, but the app won't even load. There's no way to cancel to avoid being billed for something I can't use. If the update doesn't fix this, the BBB will be involved. *UPDATE* Update didnt fix it. I have since cancelled my account & will likely never try this app again. One thing I can not stand above all else, is being trapped into paying for something with no way of cancelling without jumping through a hundred hoops. Even more so when I can't even use it.",
"Game freezes constantly.  There is always issues with freezing and the screen blacking out.  I have had for almost a year and my child has only been able to play half the time.    It has great learning tools, it's to bad the app has constant issues.",
"It would be a good app if it didn't freeze up all the time, super slow and frustrating takes 5 minutes or longer just to click on one object or to get a lesson to work,, I contacted customer support several times and it is still difficult to get the app to work,. I have high speed internet and I still have to troubleshoot all the time,,, waist of money do to how slow it functions, my kids even get frustrated on having to wait so long to get it to work,.  It would be great if it would actually function",
With a new update my daughter cant use it no more. Way too slow and crashes. I emailed customer service 2 times with no response!!! If you charge monthly fees why would you just ignore my email? I am totally unsatisfied with it. Love the abc mouse but whats the use of paying if it doesnt work and noone responds back about how to fix it!!!,
"Excellent schooling app, but... as an app it's frustrating. 1st. You can't turn the background music off. Secondly, I put my child up to learning path level 5, why do the puzzles not match the difficulty level? I have to keep adjusting the difficulty level back up on the jigsaws.  And the constant asking of my password when I am trying to make adjustments is irritating.  This program runs 100 times better on a laptop/computer.  But terrible on a tablet or smartphone.   I do recommend this to anyone with a computer, but as an app, no, too many glitches and the background music will not turn off!!!",
Its okay due to the app not always working as well as my children being able to get into all of the learning activities. A child cant explore without having that ability to do so other then that I have seen a small improvement from the both of my children.,
"I downloaded this, signed up, actually because some of my friends have small children.  When I installed it, I never could get it to open.   I have no clue if it's a good thing or not, and when I visited the website to cancel my subscription, I was referred back to the app to do that.    I'm uncertain how to proceed at this point.   So I will be removing the app from my tablet and informing my bank to stop payment when my subscription is due.   Big disappointment.",
"I don't have kids and have no idea how I was set up with a monthly subscription.  In order to cancel I have to set up an account, but the app won't even load the ""create parent account"" step so I can do so.  Very poor design and poor consideration of customer needs.",
"I would like to give it a 5, when it works it is fabulous. However, the last couple of months it spends most of its time frozen on a loading screen or not allowing my nephew to move forward no matter how many times he completes the activity.",
I originally gave this a 5 star review which I wholeheartedly thought it did deserve. Then my daughter grew older and bored with it. When I tried to cancel through the app it said there was a problem and try again later. I called the number provided and it said due to high call volumes try again later. Took me 4 months to cancel a program that we no longer use and yes they still continued to charge my card each of those times. They owe me $40.,
"Put my 1 1/2 yr old on the 2+ learning group, but it was too simple for her. She new everything and grew bored. Also the ""read to me"" games are painfully boring and often too long.  I can see this being valuable for kids who dislike learning.",
Stuck on goldilock and 3 bears story. It's the same on my wife's phone also. Been trying to continue learning path for 3 weeks. Plus takes a while before the app actually loads. Makes it not fun for my 1 year old.,
The app runs slow and sometimes it doesn't  even respond. Disappointing is not even the word when I have to pay money that I work hard forjust to have access to the app.,
I couldnt get the app to work. Itd alway freeze durning registration. And they still charged me the 7.99 after i complained and canceled the program.,
I signed up for free trial and was charged .02c then charged over $80 for an app my kids HATE.,
My daughters love this app. They are only 2 and have learned so much. Many times they think they are just playing games,
It may be my service yet a lot of the activities don't work how they would want to. Sometimes the app doesn't even work.,
Doesn't work well on my grandsons tablet. He isn't old enough to use a PC and  mouse. Disappointed,
My 3 year old has been using this app since he was old enough to push buttons. He is ahead of all of his peers at daycare. He is three and Can Read most three letter words.,
Our family bought the year subscription and our 2 year old is learning rapidly. Her speech is even improving with full sentences and proper endings.,
So stupid HAVE to type I'm unnecessary things and cost a lot of money per month DO NOT GET IT,
"My son was 20 months old when he started this learning program.... he is now 22 months and he has completed more than half of the preschool beginners level. He and I absolutely love ABC Mouse! I am so blown away at how easy and fun this program is...Well time to end my review. He is begging me to put ABC Mouse on, honestly! Lol",
My daughter is learning so much.  I love this website a lot.  It may look like she is just playing but she is also learning.,
"We have had a few issues with conductivity on our Samsung tablet, and a few other questions.  Communication with ABCmouse support seems to be poor to nonexistent (in our experience).  We'll keep trying for a bit, as our daughter does enjoy it.",
Been using for years from 2 til 5 now and he has learned so much it was a great alternative to preschool since I couldn't afford it his school says he know way more then the kids who went and I and abcmouse did a great job teaching him everything he needed to know and more,
"It worked fine a while back but now we can't even get in.  I've rebooted our pic,  tablet and phone; plus Uninstaller and re-installed the program and it still won't  let us in.  I'm thinking about canceling the subscription if we can't get into it.",
This is fun for my 3 year old granddaughter. She learns while she is having fun. She puts the puzzles together so fast now. Thanks ABCmouse.,
"Very helpful, i love ABC Mouse & so does my little guy.  We were really excited to add it to the tablet after having started on a desktop but it crashes to frequently please fix the bugs",
I use he app with my 4 year old. I am not a good academic teacher and this really helps me teach at home.,
My son loves all the games and different activities. The app keeps closing on him while he plays. I hope this gets fixed soon.,
My 4 year old loved this app and it keeps her occupied when I need to get things done.,
Will not load properly on Samsung Note tablet. I couldn't even load the customer service page to seek help.  Audio works but the learning path isn't visible 50% of the time.  Would be great if it worked.  My kids love the program.,
"Trouble loading on tablet, but works great on all other devices. We love it!",
"The kids love this. I have a 6yr old, 4 yr old and a 3 yr old. It definitely helps supplement and reinforce what they are learning in school.",
My kids love this app. It keeps them busy for hours and the fact that they're learning at the same time is amazing,
Wonderful way to have her learn. She can learn at her own pace. She is learning about all the different environments as she prepares for her first year in school.,
"The content and plan are wonderful. However, the app is essentially useless because it is painfully slow. At $100 a year for a monthly subscription this is not acceptable. Fix whatever is slowing this down and I will gladly give it 5 stars.",
She has lost interest once but is now interested again . very cool program and everything is learning.,
My son has been using this program since he was 2 and he is now 4. He is always excited about getting on and learning new things.,
All of my kids love this site from my 7 year old to my 1 year old. It increases cognition and helps the kids to experience new learning. It really helps me with homeschooling my kids.,
"This app is really buggy and though it has tons of great activities, if you don't supervise your child every minute they will either be stuck doing the same activity forever or kicked out of the constantly crashing app.",
"I love the activities and so does my 3 year old. However, a few lessons are running slow. Due to this my daughter is losing interest. She used to say ""I want to play my mouse game"" now that has turned to ""I don't like the mouse"". Please fix",
They charged my account hidden fees and it is a battle to get my money back. Good learning tools for kids but it takes all your money,
We use this for the kids to have educational fun when we get busy. It keeps their minds going,
"I started my account for our three granddaughters.  We now have 7 grandchildren and they all LOVE ABC Mouse.  Their parents do too because they know their children are gaining so much more from ABC Mouse than they would from a video game, but the children enjoy it every bit as much!",
"My 2 boys are learning and finds it fun at the same time, making it interesting for them to know more and push themselves.",
"I was skeptical, but now I'm like I should have done this sooner. My 5 yr old and 3 yr old love it.",
It's a great app for starting your children on basic education. I feel like it is a good tool to prepare your child for school.,
I love abcmouse and it has grown and added more things as my oldest has grown. Now my youngest is starting. Only down side I bought a Kindle Fire for my oldest and she can not play the higher levels on her device,
"It says free, but once you waste data downloading free app you must enroll in membership to begin with cc info",
Ggreat app. But customer service is horrible. I have been on the phone waiting for a representative for over 30 minutes. Thats absolutely ridiculous.,
"My daughter loves this app, but she really hates that when it's reading the stories it freezes....please fix this issue for all tablets and computers",
My daughter mary has learned so much and really loves abc mouse. Hopefully when my son maximus is ready to learn we will use abc mouse :),
Love the program but the app is extremely glitchy. The app constantly freezes and makes the phone and tablet overheat.,
My daughter has been using abcmouse for over a year now. She loves it and that helps her learn.,
This program is wonderful for children I love helping my son work through the activities he's 2 and he is doing well,
"My two children, ages 4 and 7, use and love ABC Mouse. It has games and teaching tools for all ages. We loved it so much that we now have an account of our own. I view what they have learned and how well they are doing. Love it so much I'm sure my 4 mth old will be using it soon enough.",
"Just downloaded last night. Keeps randomly closing out. If not for that,we might really like it.",
"My 4 year old loves this app he knows how to count sing and recognize his letter he sounds them out now, we've had the app for almost 2 years now it's a good development helper",
I love this program but it isn't compatible with my daughter's tablet even though it has an android operating system üòî,
This is a wonderful educational app for toddlers. My toddler has advanced academically quite well. I would recommend this educational app to any and all parents.,
My great granddaughter loves abc mouse. She'll be 2 in May and has learned her colors and count to ten thanks to abc mouse. She also loves  the  songs and music videos.,
I just found two charges on my bill for the month of November even though I have not used this product for over a year. I thought I only signed up for one year but of course if you do not cancel they still charge you. I am hopeful this company will resolve this issue quickly and I will be happy to change my review.,
"My son loves this and can play it all day. I love the fact that as he has fun, he is learning at the same time.",
"My child loves all the games and learning activities. And I like all the stuff, like songs, puzzles, and coloring she gets to do.",
"My daughter still loves this app and it has proven itself to be a great educational tool. She knows all her letters, numbers, and so much more thanks to this app. She has so much fun playing and learning thank you abc mouse!",
"My 6 year old LOVES this app!  He has so much fun with it, he doesn't even realize how much he's learning!",
"So far so good, but I am disappointed that I did not get my free month before you charge my credit card.",
Needs high speed Internet or doesn't load. Also there's no app designed for my kids Samsung tablets. Paid 4 months and never used,
My grandson loved this the moment I signed him up for it. He learns more and more of ABC Mouse each day. He especially loves earning tickets after each lesson is completed.,
"My two-year old got addicted to this, and now only three she's as smart as a whip and converses with every kid around...older kids and adults think she's 4 or 5.  This app is a great tool!!",
We only use it on the tablet and computer because I dont allow my 4 year old to use my phone and he really loves it. I really love that he loves it and that he's solidifying all the work they do in preschool.,
Happy they added new grades but i don't understand why we need to pay so much,
This is an amazing tool for kids. I love using it on the computer because the app continues to crash on my kids LG tablet. My kids can not play it and have fun because every 3 mins the app crashes. Hopefully the developers can fix this issue.,
I can't believe that it is free. I Thank you so very much. and Aliyah is having the time of her life.,
"There are some things that need to be easier to navigate (or continuous like the alphabet drawing or puzzles) for little ones. Overall my kids like it and ask to play it, but not for long periods.",
My daughter loves this app. Thats all she plays now. Cause she wins tickets and shes learning so much,
What a wonderful app for my children to use and learn with couldn't be happier with it.,
Lags a ton on most of the games. Keep on having to force close and restart app after it freezes. 5 stars when fixed!,
My daughter likes the all the different choices.  She enjoys the prizes she can get with the tick ed ts she earns.,
It gets stuck on a lesson alot and prevents child from continuing in a timely manner.,
"My child didn't care for it. I tried to contact customer service several times to cancel, thought it was but every month my card was charged. If they don't stop I'm going to call the BBB to resolve this. Not sure why this is happening...",
"Awsome app, as a teacher with a degree in early childhood and elementary edu, I recommend this to any age 2 to 2nd grade. I use this with my own kids.",
My daughter had problems with reading and numbers she has improved extremely in . time with ABCmouse,
"It won't let me log in. It zooms in when I type in the ""create a parent"" page, but won't zoom out or scroll over to the next button. I uninstalled it and redownloaded it, and it still doesn't work!",
I enjoy seeing my son have fun while learning. This website/app is definitely worth it.,
I don't like that they don't have tests. My son has issues with reading and he doesn't pay attention when it reads for him. I'm new to the app but I really think it should let him read it and quiz him after,
My daughter absolutely loves ABCMouse. I love seeing her light up everytime she completes a new lesson. She has grown so much and she never gets tiered of it! üíúDefinitely worth it!,
Won't let me deactivate my account.,
We enjoy doing this together. My daughter loves to sing the songs and I love the print outs. She is having fun and learning and I love saving the activities sheets for her to look at later when she is older.  This is a magnificent tool for education.,
Kids like however there have been several glitches. Need to fix these!,
"It shouldn't say ""free"" if it offers one month free & then you are charged after. You only find this out AFTER you download the app. No thanks. It should'nt say FREE next to the app in the app store.  It should say ""free trial"". Why pay anything for an app when there are so many learning apps out there that ARE truly free.",
This may be an amazing app but it is deceptive to list it as free when it cannot be accessed without payment information. This should be more clearly stated.,
It's every thing the commercials claim and so much more! Worth every penny!,
My daughter loves it she enjoys playing it and don't know she's learning she is 3 years old.,
"My granddaughter uses this in her class  and she loves it,also its help her so much.",
I signed up for the free trial and they billed me for a year! The customer service does not respond and my two year old is not even interested in it!,
It is terribly slow on a tablet. Hope you can fix this! Also freezes when done with the level in the learning path.,
My two kids love this app they think they are playing games but they are actually learning new things.,
We just love this app. It's great educational fun for my children.  Thank you.,
I love this app. My Bug loves this and begs to play. I love that you can add multiple kids. It also helps my niece States away.,
I don't think you should have to pay for your kids learning on a tablet or phone when you already pay for the tablet or phone service. It's our children for goodness sakes. Free learning for every child!!,
Thank god for this app. I've added the $3 extra to know how they are doing so excited. Very easy to set up n install.,
My 3 yr old loves it but sometimes it just closes while he's using the app.,
This is a waste of money. It won't load and when is dose it will crash while playing. I have tried two tabs one Apple and Android. GET AT YOUR OWN RISK,
"My granddaughter loves it, at 3 years old it gives her active mind everything she needs.",
I cannot get everything to load properly. This is very frustrating since I just paid for 13 months!!!!!!!,
ABC Mouse has been so helpful! We couldn't be happier to have it!,
It is hard to put into words how spectacular this app is. Our kids have learned a tremendous amount even just playing around a little on it. I know they learned a lot and our little girl continues to when she plays it a lot!,
"I have two girls ages 5 and 7  my 5 is in kindergarten and my 7 yr old in 1st grade. They love it, it surpassed my expectations!!  I totally recommend! !",
"My kids like it, but they do not always get there tickets when completing a game/puzzle etc. The ""mouse"" will tell them they already completed (song/puzzle etc) 5 times that day, when its the first time they've done it. Kinda annoying how long it takes to load to.",
My kids love it but keeps crashing when the lesson is over and freezes on the pets section,
This app is absolutely wonderful! My five year old hardly notices that he's doing things that are learning activities and instead thinks he's just playing games!,
"Awesome. Only one problem, it tends to crash on my tablet.",
Keeps popping a message up saying it's stopped even when it hasn't been used,
My son loves to learn! Its easy to follow and he can do it by his selfüòçüòç,
"After the update, the app continually crashes",
Every time my son tries to play the games portion the games freeze.,
It crashes before I can finish registering!! Paying for nothing.,
Not providing card information untill trying the app. Definitely uninstalling,
My 4 years old the game.. bit I have a suggestion... Y'all should make a progress sheet for the parents on their tablets. Where u don't have to go through the app to get progress,
My granddaughter has learned so much.  Learns and is entertained as well!,
its helpful but it freeze alot when my kids get to the part where you have to trace to letter or word it stop working. And it move very slow when writing the letter,
This app crashes constantly. Don't waste your money.,
My son loves this app. It teaches him many things.,
You have to pay for this is the second bad part the first is you cant use it without a credit card,
Do not buy or select free trial its a scam! Bad quality and not worth it!,
It not helpful in spelling for children that need help with learning disabilities,
"It is awesome all the learning a child get from the app. While home to help them in school,",
My son just started ABC mouse and you can already how much he has learned! Has has been behind with his learning and it has helped him catch back up. We love it!!!,
"My kid's love it. It's helped both of my children in reading skills, math and so much more.",
Wish there were higher levels for older children.  My daughter quickly outgrew it,
My 4 year old daughter loves it and has learned so much. I wish my other 2 kids had ABCmouse growing up!,
My son loves ABC mouse and asks to play it rather than watch tv.,
My 7 year old loves to play. I would give it a 5 star rating if it would stop freezing up on him when he plays it. I don't want to pay $8 a month if it keeps doing this. PLEASE FIX OR I WILL UNSUBSCRIBE!!!!!!!,
Helped my child that wasn't interested in learning become interested.,
This is a fun educational app that is easy to navigate. The only issue I have is that the app freezes.,
"Crashes all the time, frustrating for a 3 year old.",
My 8 year old has ADHD and all the homeschool was not helping thank you for this!!!,
"First time I downloaded, worked fine for short time then crashed my tablet. Got rid of it, tried again months later and it crashed the tablet again. Please fix! Paying customer extremely unhappy!",
"I like that my kids can use different games and activities that are 
customized for their skill level.",
My three-year-old absolutely loves it and is learning new things everyday from it,
"Gets my phone really hot. On my kindle fire, it lags bad on both the phone and fire..I have good wifi.",
My daughter loved every thing about it. No complaints!,
My daughter is 3 I can't keep her focused on anything for too long but she loves ABC mouse !,
"Our 2 year old stays so engaged with this, he's learning every day!",
I love this app and my child wants to do her lessons constantly but she can't even get through 1 activity before the entire app shuts off and sends it back to the home screen. It is not the tablet or Wifi connection. I've done a complete factory reset on the tablet so that this app is the only one on it. Also the Wifi is full strength. Sent an email to abc mouse support 36 hours ago with no response. Fix it now or I will delete my subscription and move on to another educational company. Great app and would rate 5 stars and recommend to everyone if it would just work longer than 1 minute at a time.,
"Our 12 year old special needs daughter, 4 and 2 year old son's love ABC mouse.  They learn so much, and enjoying it!",
"Since my 3 year old isn't in a Headstart program, I felt like she was already behind other children. Decided the price for this app is well worth it. There are no other apps on my tablet!!!",
Only it 5 stars so it'll be seen. I was going to do free trail and it charged me $1 then $20 . And now i can't even  deactivated...  Can't get any help,
It's wonderful  but is now running  super slow,
my girls just can't get enough of learning . this app is great,
My 2 year old is addicted to learning. Love it,
Can not get worse then this,
How is my 4 yr old son supposed to use this app when it takes forever to load and constantly freezes up and I know it's not the device is using please fix this issue or it will be canceling my subscription,

"The only problem is it freezes up.  Our one month free trial is almost over.  We plan on paying to keep it,  I just wish you could improve the loading speed a little better.  I'd give it five stars if it worked as good on tablets and phones as it does on our desktop.  üëçüëç",
"We encounter errors every day. The game fails to progress. Customer service representatives don't offer any assistance. My children get discouraged, and lose interest, from fatal errors and memory leaks, broken games! The app functions great for a little while! Then all of a sudden, encounters errors that cause catastrophic failures.",
"I went to use a 30 day FREE trial for my 2 boys and and somehow paid for a year subscription BEFORE getting to try the 30 days free. I figured, good program I won't call and complain about it. But not even past the 30 days & it messes up all the time! Refuses to allow my children to complete their daily lessons, videos do not work, since they can't finish them they don't get their ""prize"" at the end of each day and now it won't even allow my son to progress to the next days level! Have contacted CS before!",
It's great it's helping me little four year old sister out appt she went from zero to hero and loved it,
My son loves it and wants to play on it constantly.  If we have issues with anything in the app we just email the people who run it and they usually fix it as soon as they can.  My son has been thriving since we started him in it.  Awesome app and program.,
"My son is two, so he doesn't know how to use a computer. At all. But he sure does know how to use my phone. I don't want him to always have my phone so I thought it would be a good idea to use my Acer tablet. NOPE!!!!! It refuses to load. Loads on the phone though. Very frustrating.",
"It's great on our tablets I just downloaded it on my phone fingers crossed. How, when, or what do I supposed to do so that my 4yr. old can start writing and tracing letters and numbers? Because she's having problems with writing I really want her to learn the writing part and I don't know how to get to it. So can someone help me with that?",
Keeps crashing each time i open the app. Only lets me do a few seconds on an activity than crashes,
"love the app, our toddler enjoys it, but its super slow and frequently freezes up",
the application is great but the customer service is horrible. I called and called and email them because I payed the full year yet they still charge every month and it was paid for the year and they never responded my emails or calls.,
My daughter struggles with math and I got the app to help but without any lectures or discussions she remains lost. A few lectures in the subjects would be awesome.,
That's should be enough. Kids love it and I'm glad they do. Really fun and educational there is a monthly payment but it's worth it,
"Nightmare to get cancelled! Not worth even the free trial, just because it is so hard to cancel!",
"They charged me for a free trial.. overall boring, wasn't worth it. It's basically an education you could get your child for free at the library or through any other program online :/",
"Overall, I really like this site. However, lately the app has been shutting down during play. This is very upsetting!",
"This is the best. My son loved it, but it took an unreasonable amount of time to download.:-)",
"I paid $50 and it won't go past the first couple of activities even though he has successfully completed them all. On top of that the games are boring, I've found better learning activities on free apps I wish I could get my money back!",
Fun times,
"My son loves getting on, he loves learnijg new things from playing this app. Its' interactive set up and curriculum is great, it is both educational and fun for them at the same time!",
Right it's making my daughter do activities over and over and won't let her move on. The read to me part isn't working either. Definitely will NOT be paying for another year of this website.,
It's impossible to cancel subscription! Had to get a different credit card.,
helping my needy grandson out so much he loves it also,
"This is not an educational, fun or engaging app for kids.",
"I loved this app, but it seems like the latest update is dragging so badly on my android tablet. It crashes so often that it's barely use able anymore.",
"I have been using this since two years. My kid loves it. I didn't have any problems till now. However,  since a month it's freezing, not updating after an activity. That's really frustrating.  Could you please fix the problem? Otherwise I would be forced to cancel my subscription.",
My 4 year old adores ABC mouse and it really is a great app for him. My complaint is the speed lately. It's lagging so badly that it's hard for him to use it. This is on a brand new tablet.,
It is great minus the lagging and freezing and being kicked off please fix the problem,
App and website allows kids to use abcmouse on different devices. It has a wide variety of activities for younger kids to keep them busy without getting bored and educating them at the same time.,
Too expensive 4 nothing. Its pure business here. Dont bother. I feel like one star is too much to rate this app its needs üëéüëéüëéüñìüñìüñìüñìbig time.,
My 2 year grandson loves this app!! Loves the games and alphabet songs. There's so much to learn and explore.,
Runs extremely slow and takes so long to respond to anything you do that I can't get my child to use it past the basic intro,
My son had speech problems before ABC Mouse & now he speaks full clear sentences! He's only been using it for about 6 months. He loves it!,
The app keeps closing anytime I try and open it. Its really annoying.,
My 5 year old and 3 year old love it.  They can sit all day and play and LEARN.,
Every day my little brother plays ABC Mouse.He loves it.Get ABC Mouse now.,
Has glitches that are pretty frustrating for a kid and they happen fairly frequently.,
Nice for my son just some glitch on occasion,
My now 3 YO is doing amazing from this she has had it since she was 18 months old and it has made her a mega smarty we always get compliments on how smart she is!,
My 2 year old boy has already learned his numbers and Alphabet! He loves the app!,
She is 3 years old and can't wait to play this educational game!,
My 3 year old daughter loves this app! She loves that she is rewarded tickets for completing lessons.,
Keeps my kids occupied and it is not just the normal dumb games...they are learning something,
This website and app have been a great learning experience for my granddaughter. She now works hard at using different games to earn tickets to care for pets. Fun!!!,
Its good for my son keeps freezing up please fix,
Our children loves this app and it's educational. What could be better!,
This app is very fun and grabs my kids attention to learn.,
"My daughters enjoy it, and they end up spending at least an hour on it.",
My kids are learning faster on Thier own building confidence in themselves everyday!,
You can see the difference in how your child speaks and looks at the world,
There are a lot of glitches in the program.,
Wonderful educational app for my 4 year old ! Absolutely love it !,
My 3 and 4 yr old love it!! So many different activities!,
"I really love this game  because my son is getting really amazed, exited and educated. üòúüôãüë®üë¶üëåüìù",
fun fun fun fun!!!!!!-Thank you,
My daughter loves it and is learning so much! üòç,
Definitely worth every penny.  Highly recommend.,
Great app for learning! My kids beg to play!,
My daughter has learned so much from this program!,
My son is 4 and loves it,
Cancel me,

ABC mouse,
"My 4 year old finds this very boring, he loses focus quickly and doesn't want to play. He says ""I don't want to go on abc mouse is just sooo boring mom"" so I guess we will just stick to the other apps that can entertain him a bit more.",
The games freeze up and you have to shut the phone down to get the app to work again and sometimes it makes you redo activities that have already been completed. Needs updating soon or I won't be signing up after the free trial.,
"Doesn't matter what device I use this on, we are paying for it to crash after every game. The lessons are boring and my kid has no interest in the same repetitive stuff. Oh look ANOTHER puzzle... I bumped him up to level 5 hoping for it to be challenging and its the same thing every time. Color this, now its a puzzle, have something read to you.",
This website has alot to offer but with it not functioning at its best it's a waste of membership. I'm almost canceling because my son cannot play without it freezing force closing or glitching. This may be my last month because of this,
"Total piece of crap! U download it because of a promise of a IPhone 7 or laptop or something like that but it may say ""FREE"" BUT it wants a card number & it won't take a card with no money on it! Even if you get it your  child will like it about as much as a retarded man likes a physics theory! The designers can blow me!",
"My child love this program. He uses it at school, on the desk top. But anytime we use it on our Samsung tablet or out cell phones (android; Samsung and droid) there is such a delay in everything they do. It take forever to go through a puzzle due to the lag. I'm very disappointed, BC the program has helped him so much. I might be cancelling my subscription due to this. We can't play it on the go or anywhere but at home. Now days we are always on the go. It's very disappointing, BC we have loved ABC mouse!",
"Good educational content but the app freezes evetytime, makes no sense purchasing an app that moves so slow.",
"Locks up or won't open some screens, frustrating when trying to teach 4 year old and  have to restart app or go in/out of rooms until it works.  Using Galaxy Tab.",
My kids love this app. It makes learning simple and fun by being repetitive. You will need to help your smaller children along at first but once they get the hang of it they won't want to put it down.,
My daughter was so excited to learn and everyone raves about abc mouse. So I got it for her. She is so bored and the app takes forever to change pages or do anything. So frustrating for her.,
"Great investment for independent learners or any children having trouble with individual subjects. I can't tell you how happy I am that I got this for my son, he has improved so much and is excited to learn and share what he's done!",
Bought to use on my tablet and it was working fine. After less than a month it decided it wants to refuse to boot up. Ended up uninstalling it and reinstalling over 7x - even factory reset my tablet....still no change.,
"ABC mouse is amazing, my son is almost 3 years old & has easily learned so many new things with this app & I'm looking forward to watching him excel & become even smarter than he already is!!!! The future is looking very bright for my son because of this app, so thank you from the bottom of my heart ABC Mouse!!! üòòüòÜ",
Love the app but don't like that the app disappears after downloading and opening up on the nabi my daughter uses please help to fix this issue.....,
I use abc mouse with my 3 yr old and she loves it. She loves the games and songs. She loves to dress up her avatar,
The learning path takes so long to load the lesson and then when it loads it lags horribly and I'm using abc mouse designed specifically for Samsung I'm running the highest rate of Internet speed so it's not on my end,
"Constantly force closes, runs slow, and doesn't load games correctly. Maybe if it was free but no thanks",
I worked really had to get my sone to try to get involved with trying to learn with ABC Mouse but in the last 6 months to a year it's been a fighting battle and im still doing it...,
"App used to run pretty good on our high-end tablets, came back a few month later, and updates made the app crawl and crash more often, even on our high-end nvidia tegra tablet! These bugs make this membership grade app really hard to appreciate.",
"We keep not getting tickets for songs. It tells us we already did it 5 times that day, even if it's our first song.",
"We've used ABC Mouse app for almost 4 yrs. My son loves it, and the curriculum is great! We're bummed because we have to keep buying new devices to keep up with ""updates"" constantly being made to this app. Bought a brand new phone with the compatable processor. App worked great, for 2 weeks... Now wont play certain videos. Really? Not happy.",
Love the concept and it's very educational but the app just crashed 6 times in 5 mins. How are children supposed to learn if they keep getting interrupted? Terrible app. Great learning resource. If the app remains shoddy ABC Mouse should lower the price. No need to pay so much for a resource you can't use.,
"Let's me  log in But stuck loading on register  page.... So how do we get this resolved for my 2 year old son? Was thinking to remain an ""OFFICIAL COSTUMER"" ,other wise his Early Learning Ability  is until Blocked! And force me to cancel!",
It's THE best  my  granddaughter  loves it she's been watching and playing with this app for the first three years of her life and she's 3 it's the best thing since sliced cake,
This is a great Learning System but we can not get the app to work like it's supposed,
"My daughter loves playing ""school time"" as she calls it.  I can actually see the progress she's making too.  It has a habit of freezing up tho which can be annoying.",
"I've thought about it for years, but finally took the plunge.  I honestly wish I had a long time ago.  The kids love it and I don't have to worry about ads or content.",
"Installed the app but the app will not open. When I tap the abcmouse icon, it goes to the picture of the mouse then it exits the app. It has never worked on my phone.",
My 4 and 6 years old grandchildren got bored with it after a short while.,
Im starting this with my one year old daughter and shes already responding to the games we love it....,
"Amazing how much more my daughter hs grown, but if we can have the standards listed that would be great...",
This is the best educational program for children. My kids have learnt a lot with ABC mouse.  My 2+ son that have not started preschool yet knows so much already like colours and shapes among others. I recommend abc mouse again and again to any parent seeking for a solid educational foundation for the kid.,
Even on Wi-Fi the game still won't work right and takes forever to load. Its very complicated and confusing needs to be easier for kids to work it and get to everything,
"My 4 yr old granddaughter, was the only 4 yr old that new ""Allllllll"" her shapes and colors in her pre-k class..",
"So educational, she loves ABC mouse begs for it! And the great thing is its easy for her she doesn't need my help other than to sign in....",
"Very disappointed. This app hardly worked, was very slow and just caused more frustration than it was worth. App constantly froze during any user interaction and would get caught saying one word repetitively.",
My daughter loves this and the best part is she doesn't realize she's learning while having fun,
This is the best thing i have downloaded. But i wish you have the option for another language for child development,
"It actually gets my 2 year old to learn things. I love this app, he's very pro active with it.  He sings the songs, learns his abc and numbers. My 1 year old loves it as well.",
"I got this app for my Two year old it is supposed to be free, but the charged my anyways and it keeps freezing before we can make the account. I am very angry that I got charged for something that my son couldn't even use once!",
"This is one way trap to get your credit card information, after that they will automatically bill you. There is no setting in the app to stop the payment in the app, like it was described during the app installation.",
"The android app is incredibly frustrating, keeps crashing, screen freezes every time. Apple version of the app is much better. I already have an android tab,  now do i need to buy ipad just because your app is so bad for android?",
"I put in my card for the 30 day trial period. Well I tried to access the account but it's not letting me. It did freeze often when my children played, but now they don't want to play it. Please fix it.  Thank you",
"Filled with games and activities for kids. My son just turned two and he loves it. Every time he hear the tune on the app, he goes nuts. We both enjoy it.",
The kids love using this app and there is a great reward system built in where they can buy stuff with the tickets they earn....so it keeps them coming back and learning!,
ABC Mouse has been a great tool for my children to learn. It's fun and educational. I've been using it for both my children for years and will continue to do so until my youngest outgrows it,
Both my children love it. my 2 year old is as far along as his 5 year old brother with Autism.,
Constantly crashes and loads too slowly.  Small children don't sit still to  wait for this to load.,
Brought this for my 5y/o daughter. She can't even get through one assignment before it closes. They need to fix this or I want a refund!,
My 4 year old has learned so much using this app. I love it.,
My daughter Katalina is 4yrs old. She loves ABC mouse! She has learned so much !! She is actually advanced for her age.,
Best app ever my kids love it. I'm so glad I bought this it's worth every penny.,
Grabs their full attention and I know they are learning. Also I love the prizes within the game! Great!,
We love this app it really helps all 3 of my sons at different levels from 3 year old all the way up to a nine-year-old this is a very great investment,
My three year old loves this app. It is worth the money to see her have fun learning.,
"For such an expensive app you'd think that this thing would perform well however we find that we get stuck on numerous activities because the activities don't function right. Games freeze, puzzles are impossible to complete, and often the app will not count activities as being complete after we have completed them. We will not be renewing our subscription after this year.",
"I've been trying for months to cancel and it's impossible. They keep changing the billing and say where to cancel, but it never exists, and they won't talk to you.",
It funny how as a parents gotta pay a app that should be free.  It's for kids to learn.  I rather look for a app that is free and my kids can learn without paying every month,
All this app does is shut down. Every time I try to use it on my tablet it crashes. Now I have a very upset 2 y/o who wants to play. If this isn't fixed soon I will have to cancel my subscription.,
"I've heard a lot about this site, so I decided to give it a try",
Cant load on tablet.  Program won't open.  Only worls on phome and laptop.  So much for learning anywhere.,
I am surprised that all that I have heard is true. My 3 year old LOVES ABC Mouse. Thank you,
Boring/ all it allows me to do is learning  about your numbers and letters,
I am so glad we found this app. My grands love the learning games,
Takes way to long to load any page on all devices and not worth the money. Very disappointed and was very interested and excited to try something new,
"This is an excellent learning experience,my preschool age grandson is completely engaged every time he plays!",
My daughter loves to play and earn tickets so she can shop!  Fun way to learn,
It's a great tool to teach a variety of subjects in fun ways. It's the first thing that he asks for in the morning!,
This app is amazing and very helpful for my little girl she absolutely loves this game keep it up ABC Mouse.,
My kids love playing this but we can only do it on our laptop or computer. It doesn't work on ANY of our handheld devices. Fix your freaking app ABC Mouse!!! A hot mess!!!,
I downloaded this app 3 days ago and pay for the year not once I proceeded to the registration part because it won't stop loading! and now I can't cancel my membership because it's freezing this sucks I do not recommend this app!! I am very upset,
üê≠ ABC mouse is a great app. It teaches my child Madisen alot.Now she loves to learn.üêÅABCüêÄ,
We have been using this app for several years. It prepared both of our children for school.  Our children love this app!,
Great,
I like how much it teaches my child but it freezes frequently.,
My 7 year old son with autism and his almost 2 year old brother love it,
My kids love it! App works just as well as on the computer.,
Is the best game for my kids they don't know they are learning is amazing üòÑ,
"Both my 16-month-old and my 4-year-old loves ABCmouse. The intro music catches my 16-month-old's attention, even if he's crying! He loves the songs. My 4-year-old enjoys the games, the pets, and dressing up her Avatar",
Amazing my daughter didn't go to preschool  and this really helped!,
You should get it,
We have been using it for a few years now and its been great so far even on my phone (cause my kids broke our tablet).,
She plays the games and  loves the songs and stories.,
This app is great i just wish there was a way to control them staying on the learning path my daughter likes to just listen to the songs,
My son has made progress immediately. It's amazing,
"My two children love this program, they have learn so muchüíë",
My daughter loves using this app! She's definitely learning a lot from it,
Do yourself a favor and don't download this,
"My little sister loved it, she doesn't get tired, she wants to do more and more!!!",
"Kiddo's love it,best spent money yet",
I'm daughter loves ABC mouse!! She asks everyday can she use it. I have recommended it to several of my friends to use it!!! The price is even Better!!,
"Best app for children of all ages. My kids are 2, 5 and 8. They all love it!  It keeps them all busy for hours and they are learning too.  What more could you ask for?!",
Great way to keep my kindergarten twins engaged in learning....learning in a fun wayüëç,

Lag ... such bad lag and then it won't load 90% of the game and only show pieces that make it unplayable. It also locks up at reward time and doesnt give her the rewards shes earned.  Also there is a try before you buy but you have to goto the website to create your ID.,
"My wife and I pay monthly for abc mouse for our two year old. He has learned all of his basic shapes, and colors. He is starting to recognize numbers and letters as well. We have only had abc for three months. He has really blossemed, and he really seems to like it. I use the app because it is more hands on and he cant use a computer mouse just yet.",
"My daughter just turned 4 and she loves ABC Mouse. I sit and work with her on the activities for awhile & then let her peruse on her own. I know she is learning new things because while watching Spirit, she said, ""the horse is having a baby. No, a foal."" It surprised me that she corrected herself and knew the term for a baby horse. But the animation for the ""My Pets"" section could be better.",
I would easily give it a 4-5 star if it was easy to cancel the subscription or to get a hold of customer service. My child has now outgrown the curriculum and the experience trying to cancel the subscription has sullied  the entire experience which would have otherwise ended on a positive note. So you would need to ask yourself if your money is worth being held hostage at the end.,
"ABCmouse is very helpful and educational for my 4 year old, however, during our free trial we had no problems with the app. Once I started paying we started having issues with this app. It won't allow my son to properly trace his name or anything else, it won't sing the ABC song so that he could sing along. Please look into these issues, because at this point I'm feeling like I've been had.",
"They billed me asap before i even got to open the app, they advertise that you get a free month but totally false in my case. First i was charged a dollar, then the full month price and an additional 20 to 30 bucks so I'm definitely wouldn't recommend this app simply because their billing department needs desperate help.",
"This app is very unstable at this time. The first time I logged in I was able to get as far as making my kids avatar, the the app closed. Every time I tried to go back in, I could not get past the video screen. I will delete and reinstall. If its better I will change my rating",
"So disappointed that they don't allow you to try first and by the time you entered your payment then there's no refund if you don't like it even it offers the first month free.  As a parent, you have have to check out first before you could decide if it's good for your child or not, but then when you found out not good for the child and it is too late because they already charged you.  Google please take this app down before more parents get into the trick game. Thanks.",
"My kids love this game, but lately some of the games and lessons load very, very slow. It takes almost 5 mins to do an easy game. Is there an update I don't know about or is there more people l having the same issue? But all in all, a great app!",
"My kids barely play it and it is boring. I don't believe it's worth the money,even for their special of 35 dollars. They should improve the user interface to entice the children.",
Downloaded FREE app and they charged me instantly. Now I will definitely not purchase,
"the app has a bit of trouble, yet when it works, its definitely a 5!",
We was told that our first month would be free but I was charged that is messed up. They also said that my information was safe with them but I was hacked . This is bull,
"My daughter really enjoys all the lessons and games. We do have issues with loading and pages getting stuck sometimes. However, it is a wonderful collection for educational interaction with our little princess.",
On my daughter's tablet its constantly glitches other than that it really does teach her.,
My 10 year old daugther did this in pre-k and now shes all A's,
"The app drags, soo slow it doesn't keep his attention, annoys me. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",
"Hi, i like the app a lot but the interface is not kid friendly. my kid always ends up at home screen .. may be some icons shd be smaller.. take some ideas from starfall if needed :)",
My kid never liked the site. Never used it. Preferred books to computer. Waste of money for us,
So it's cool app but I don't want to pay them anymore like my 4 year old go to school now and I don't want to pay for this any more how to them taken money for me please help someone,
My son was tracing letters with another app and he is 3 so he is quickly learning what each letter is. He loves it so far,
Very recomended.  My daughter is 3 I have never seen her so focused and having so much fun.,
I recently subscribed and The App Always freezes up or Takes  Extremely long to load!! Very disappointing!,
I can login online but not on the app :(,
Won't give credit for a finished task and won't let my son progress. Day 1 and having issues already.,
Its fun for my daughter she think she is playing games. But in reality she is learning and enjoying do it. Win win for both of us. She sit by herself and choose her own activities independently. Our family loved it.,
My only negative is you can't use it without internet.,
"Our kids love to ""play abc mouse"" they have no idea they are actually learning something while playing. I would recommend to anyone!!",
He gets so exited to get tickets to purchase and learn a lot  without knowing.  I really recommend to all mom's. üëç üíü,
May work for some people but I wanted to cancel and after spending just under 2 hours waiting to speak to someone it hung up and cancel button wouldn't work,
My 5 year old  twins love it. My 9 year old wont admit it but she loves it too.,
"ABC Mouse is awesome. My son loves it. We play together, read together, dance to the music together and so much more.  He is also able to work independently. This is the best educational website I have found.",
Daughter loves the lessons she can get through. Not so happy it shuts off in middle of lessons repeatedly and one she can't get past at all because it shuts off constantly in the middle of the story.,
My 3 year old loves this app. She says its her homework and she needs to learn more!,
"I'd love it, if only the app wouldn't freeze up so often.  Otherwise it's a great tool and my 3 year old son loves it.",
We love this app but I have three kids and It won't change the user üòû,
Put me under Nell Ellis Ellis shut your mouth,
This is a great app my daughter learns like she is in school awesome we love it.,
Because im 1000 I kniw all thiese,
It's a really good idea. The app is easy to use (for both me and my child). She just wasn't very interested.,
"After paying for game, service was limited.",
Worked great now can't switch users parent section won't load. Uninstall and getting a refund. Will not recommended the app to anyone!!!!!!,
Cool free app but then within the app you pay for educational information. Scam. Uninstalled this!!!!!!!,
I don't understand why the app needs to have access to my SD card and has the ability to potentially change things on the SD card or delete them.,
My kids are really learning new info and they are becoming smarter becausd of this app. 5 star app!,
Messed up my galaxy tablet bad.,
"Why would you let people download this to a Galaxy tab, have them obligate themselves to a seemingly endless subscription, just to find out that the app content is utterly impossible to use or load? I can't even get past the initial registration. You need to fix this.",
"I downloaded this to get some tokens on another game, cool concept though.",
Not worth the money 80% of the time Dont work,
Way way way cool,
....but stop working with the recent update...I will try to uninstall and reinstall...,
My daughter loves this app she has learned a lot and she is only 3 love ot,
My  2 little  ones love ABC mouce . Com & it makes  it  fun to  learn!! üòä,
"This app is impossible to use. It requires parent registration but while on the interface, once you click in the name text box, the app zooms in and away from the 'next'  button and so there's no way to proceed beyond this initial page. Pinch zoom in/out doesn't work because it's in full screen. And you were made to submit credit card details before trial signup. Uninstalling.",
Works perfect on my phone but not on my tablet.,
My son loves using this. It provides fun learning & is very precise,
Kid paced leading to educational goals prepares for kindergarten and beyond.,
Uses false pretenses to bill persons whom do not wish to suscribe and actually does not remove persons from subscriptions upon request,
I love this game for my brother and sister,
I still use the app and I'm 8,
App Always froze on my sons.,
Hi this app help me and this app is good for your sun and you will love this app,
My child love this program!,
Ok.. First of all. This keeps on closing while my son is using the app. Pretty sure I didn't pay for something to keep having issues.,
It really helps educate the child before entering school,
I'd recommend this to anyone.,
Amazingly educational  app for my 4 yr old grandson Gabe. He loves it!!!,
does not install on all devices and really needs to be more user friendly to keep up with your childs education level,
I love this app for my niece,
I have a two year old and she loved it.,
My kids love the art on this app,
My children enjoy learning from accessing mouse,
It says the program is installed but I can't find it anywhere to launch it.,
It worked really good and it's fun,
It helps kids  learn,
It really helped my son.,
It really helps kids learn,
Great for all ages,
Very resourcful and wonderful for childrens learning,
Love you guys love this app,

PLEASE make this compatible on the new Samsung tablets :( Only reason we bought one was so my daughter could play it... guess we will have to find another similar app.  UPDATE It is now an app for android but it's painfully slow and freezes often. Support  is worthless and never responds..,
"My son has been using ABC Mouse for a year now, he's in Pre-K. Both his teacher and his principle have said that he reads as well as a 1st grader. He's able to count up to a thousand, addition and subtraction from 1 to 12. I'm so proud and happy keep up the great work",
"My 5 yr old has been using this since she was 4 & she loves it. The activities aren't mean to compete with fast paced, shoot em up style video games. They are meant to teach children basic foundation knowledge to help them succeed in school. This does that and more. My daughter had already mastered the skills at the preK level so I just bumped her up a level. I feel like this has given her a great advantage as she begins Kindergarten. Those writing bad reviews probably misunderstood the intention of the app",
My son is 2 and it is already expecting to know the alphabet and spell things like quail... there isnt anything on here that he can do by himself. I was expecting this app to teach the alphabet and his numbers and colors before he starts school but according to this app at 2 he should already know all these things. I dont think im going to keep it... thanks for the 30 day trial... my 2 yr old is very smart for his age but this stuff is crazy,
I got a year subscription at Christmas time you pay 3 payments get last one off. They suspended my subscription telling me I didn't pay but won't answer me about the Christmas special. This is very unprofessional! To have written 3 times to customer support with no answer good program for kids but they will rip you off! All about the money!,
I started using ABC mouse when my oldest was diagnosed with a speech delay 3 years ago. The amount of progress that he made within even a month was amazing! Now all three of my kids use it as a supplement to their school work. It is truly the best thing out there.,
"Bubble pop type games and some animations run very sluggish on the tablet. They run fine on computer. Also,wish the learning path matched on both tablet and computer. It would make it easier when teaching, as I use this for homeschooling a lot. It gets frustrating when we are on the solar system on tablet but three scenes ahead on the computer. I love incorporating the current environment into our lessons. Over all, we love ABC mouse. These are just a few quirks I have found.",
"I'm quite intrigued by the app, however, reading the reviews seems like android devices encounter many issues with this app. I was even thinking of getting my son a tablet to really give him time with this learning app and not just anytime I let him use my phone, but after reading all this, I'm not sure. I'd love some clarification please, and/if the ""android unfriendly"" issue has been taken cared off, or if it's just for Apple devices? Anyways, Thank you.",
"I bought my daughter abc mouse gift card.I started the set up process & it won't let me finish the last 2 steps.We paid $15 for 2 months,I created an account & added the card to the account.I was looking forward  to this app by my daughter  has it at school & asked for it on her tablet.It won't let me finish  the set up.It's stuck where you name your pets & won't let me select anything!! Please fix the issue!My daughter has 2 moths paid for but we can't even get past the set up after you create an account!",
"We've had ABC mouse for over a year and an half... Well in the last few months I've been doing ""homework time"" since my nephew is back in school..  And I can really see the difference..  He's talking better..  He can count more, shapes, letters,  colors..  OMG he's blowing me away with how much he's learning..  Thank u ABC mouse! All those commercials were right on the spot!  If u feel ur child is not learning up to there potential get them on ABC mouse they will blow u away!",
"My grandson has had it for a week now and watching him enter act with the activities is priceless. He is one and works site better than I do. Do not wait one minute longer,; order it now for that special child/ren in your life.",
"Way over priced. Cancelled a week after I paid for a year! Bad app! Now, a year later they charge me for a another year?? I cancel again. Then call customer service. No one answers. An hour on hold before I give up. Go to their horrible website to find out NO REFUNDS!!! Not even five minutes later!?! From my prospective this is theft and fraud hidden behind a none accessible customer service! Steer far clear of this scam of an app. Your child will learn far more just talking to you.",
"You can add up to 3 children, and the best value is paying yearly vs. monthly. My children will run away from the tv to practice math, reading, art and the lessons make it so much fun. You will have smarter children with this easy to use app.",
"My son has learned some letters and numbers by site using this. He also likes the puzzles and games. He loves the avatar and changing the clothes and costumes are his favorite. It's  teaching him that he has to work to earn the tickets to buy the costumes. Only downsides are that it glitches sometimes and won't give the tickets for the activity, fairly often, also tried to delete an child account but it didn't let me, but would let me delete the other 2 kids. I can't figure out why. It also freezes up alot.",
"This is the only thing I can get my 4 year old to play that is not a game he's been introduce to by his older siblings. He loves it so much I have it on my phone,  tablet,  grandma's tablet  and  computer because it's all be wants to do! Hooray for learning!",
My children has been using this app since my now 9yr old was 3yrs old. Now my 4 yr old uses the app & enjoys it.,
"My son loves this app but once he got to the B portion and the game, he couldn't complete it. It kept freezing at the third B which is very upsetting. I would like to keep this app but not of they don't fix this very soon",
Both my children are stuck on levels that freeze and don't respond. Dislike how they charge you automatically every 6 mos. I'd rather pay and then the subscription run out.,
Several clich√©s. Hope we can get our moneys' worth out of this app.,
My daughter really love this application it works excellent. Follow update on 2016.Sep.02. After the most recent update takes a long time loading. Keep showing a paintbrush over and over.update. Downgrading from 5 to 2 stars.,
"Always a great learning tool for the kids to keep us on track with new things to learn. Also when I'm in a jam and need something to keep them occupied, I have confidence they will learn and be entertained. Good job abcmouse. Very worth the money.",
It doesn't work it's not a good app at all worst thing I ever download,
My daughter loves learning and this app is great when it weeks. I have it on her tablet and my iPad but the app keeps crashing. I don't understand. Tried downloading it to my phone and it keeps crashing as well..,
"My little nephew LOVEZ this app SOOOOO MUCH, and he's only like two so this is definitely getting him ready for preschool",
This is a great app to help prepare your preschooler for school. It is easy to use and gives them a sense of accomplishment while learning.,
My son loves the app and will be on it for hours. I love that he is learning and can play without me having to monitor the game.,
"What a fun and excited way to learn, my kids enjoy everything about this learning adventure, its fun it's engaging and they have fun while learning.",
The app is slow and after my daughter completed a game it freezes before she can earn her tickets. Very frustrating for a 4 year old,
I got this for my little boy. Registered for the free 30 days and agreed for you guys to bill me $7.95 next month and everytime I open the app it crashes. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 please fix this.,
It's a amazing app of learning but the app many times has trouble to loadüòìin my tablet and even in my phone,
"The only problem I have, is it loads slow.",
They don't send you a reminder email letting you know your free trial is going to expire and you'll be billed on such date. When trying to cancel it is literally a search party to find the section to cancel your subscription. I will not sign up again. What a mess.,
"Very easy for my kids to navigate. My kids have fun playing the games, singing the songs, and doing the other activities.",
My toddler however is not a sit down learner. Short attention span and very active.,
"My kids know so much more ,then before we started ABC mouse it prepped my 5 year old for kindergarten.",
I love it. It has helped both my boys in ways that I lacked the patience in,
I love this app so much that I have told all my teacher friends about it. It does so much and is so user friendly.,
I love this application. This program is very educational and my child can use it anywhere we go.,
"We travel the country for my husbands job, and nothing has kept my kids more ahead of the curve than abcmouse!",
"My grandson loves this, opens yhe app by himself and plays the games all while he is learning!",
My kids enjoys this keeps them entertained we hen I need them to be lol  but it is awesome way to keep them busy & learning while their having fun,
"Very great full for this educational, fun learning environment. My 4yr old loves to learn, or play as he thinks it is a game. He has progressed with the help of this app.",
We love the interaction and this beats all the apps I have already,
"Freezes after my daughter does one learning activity, especially if im not on wifi. Can this be fixed i have the galaxy s5",
Not only did they charge me after signing up for a free trial. But once I canceled my subscription it still charged me a month later as if my cancelation didn't even go through. This sent my bank account into.negative and the bank charged me an extra 30 just because this thing charging me for something I don't even want,
"I've been using this app for my Grandchildren for 10 years and I'm still impressed that each one is crazy for ABC Educational Program. Was Exceptionally glad, when app was created.",
I only wish there were more videos for songs. It would keep my daughter more interested.,
"i tried to install your program,   you charged me,  and it doesn't work for any of my systems,   phone, chrome notebook, nabia,",
Really has been helping my 3 year old with learning in a different more fun way.,
"My daughter is only two and can count to 10, knows most of the alphabet and is already learning how to spell by sounding out the words, because I am able to use this to gauge her progress!!!  Highly recommend this!  Plus the motivation factor is there because she's hooked on buying puppies!  &lt;3",
"Mi kids loves it, my 2yo knows everything for preschool and my 5 yo reads fluently i love it.",
Both my 4yr old and 7yr old love this app. Great educational tool. Even helps my special needs sister. You will not regret getting this app.,
"My 3 yr old asks me everyday to play in this app. I dont have to force her or ask her if she want to learn. We have it on our phones, tablets and computers.",
"My boys love the activities and earning tickets to buy stuff for he pets on it. I have a 7, 6 , 5,  and 1 yr old and they all play it on a daily basis.",
Boy my boy love ABC mouse. They get to learn stuff and it is fun for them. Would recommend it to anyone.,
"The fact that I can have multiple users is awesome,  My son and nephews love the games on the app,  and learn at the same time!",
We are new to ABC mouse but happy with it so far for our 5 year old.,
"At first the game's are amazing, then the kid's begin to realize that writing can allow learning",
Something going on with the app that keeps saying error won't let me in the app what a waste of time,
Was looking for a taste for free.  Have to pay or sign up at least.  That's not how apps work.  No thanks.,
My daughter has really learned alot. Totally worth every penny!,
I've been shocked how much my little girl has learned. Thanks ABC mouse!!,
"How come apple users get more content than android? I pay for the abc mouse subscription and own android devices. I should be able to utilize the same content as Apple users. This is not fair to my kid. If the a to z video app does not become available for android devices, I am not going to renew my subscription. I'm sure many other android users feel the same as I do. We pay for abc mouse just like Apple users ,  we should have the same access as them!",
I couldn't want a better app for my kids to learn with.,
Such a great game for the kids. They have fun playing it and actually learn new things.,
Crap ya its but.. i am 7 maby win my mommy comes home from geting my minecraft pe that cost mony i will show her she mite say yes or no it depends üòõüòúüòùüòëüòå‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÇüòÅüòÉüòÑüòÖüòÜüòáüòàüòâüòä,

This is the only preschool my daughter attended. This year she's in kindergarten and she is well above her peers academically. She reading on a 2nd or even 3rd grade level according to her school. Thank you ABC Mouse! I now use this with all our foster children and it's amazing to see their progress in such a short time. No matter the age.... 2-6.... They all love to earn tickets and learn. The printable worksheets are a fabulous bonus. #thankfulmommy,
"Moms of toddlers and young pre-schoolers, get ABCmouse! I know it's hard to think of paying a subscription fee for something like that, but it's such a great resource! My son can access his ""learning path"" on my phone or tablet, and to him it's just games! He loves it. ""Mama I want to do my school on your phone."" Seriously, I'm not exaggerating. He says it all the time. Also, parents can access TONS of printables to use for offscreen learning, which I love!",

"It works. Gives you what it says it will. People saying it forced them to pay are just wrong. Once you sign up and add your credit card it offers to give you a full membership ALONG WITH THE TRIAL . but you have to physically select ""no thank you"" and they won't bill you. Don't get mad at the app for trying to teach your kids something that you don't even have the skills to do yourself üòÇ",
"Buy this app. My kids love it. They are 4,4&5. It also have learning games. But parents you still have to work with your kids if you want them to really succeed. They can use it by themselves also. My kids already know everything on it except reading, which the 5 year old is doing good on. You can really teach your kids without this app like I did and use the app just to keep them sharp. Parents kids are capable of learning at any age. Turn on the radio and see",
"It looks like you just created a Web browser that only links to your site. That's not an app. Buttons are laggy, graphics are mediocre at best, and my son has zero interest. I  don't blame him. It's also a pain to cancel from a mobile device.",
"If both my girls could play at the same time it would have been 5 stars. Unfortunately, the app lags and is difficult to work again after and on multiple devices. Most of the time when it is operational again it does not sync up to the proper location on the page and the child's finger.",
"It keeps my 9month old son & 2year old brother attentive,I love all the features and activities. My only problem is it's a bit slow and freezes at times so I'm asking you to please fix all problems..... I'll rate it 5 stars upon doing so.",
"Don't use an active card, but a gift card to pay for a year's subscription or they'll continue to charge without your permission and not get back to you when you request a refund. The activities do not always work, but it's better than nothing, yet not what I would pay that much. I would hope to see the app actually reflect the commercial, because those features looks worth paying...",
My son likes this app but we keep having issues with the app not working.  Everytime I call customer service they tell me it's not the app but my tablet is too old even though my tablet is only a few months old and a $700 tablet.  It's frustrating not being able to get any help when the app has problems and it's obviously on their end.  Once our subscription is over we will not be renewing.,
"My daughter started using ABC Mouse at 2 years old, she is now 6 1/2 and still loves it. It's a fun educational learning experience with so many things that are offered, she doesn't even know she's learning because it's just like playing games, but better !",
"Having it on my phone is convenient so that my kids can use their account as much as possible. I'm not experiencing crashes, but I always have to put in my password when switching between users. That's irritating. But I REALLY wish this app was compatible with my Galaxy Note 10.1. It makes more sense on a bigger screen. UPDATE: Awesome app on a tablet! Thanks for making it compatible.",
"The app/program is ok. My child likes it occasionally. It will keep her busy for a little while. I don't know if my child is in fact learning from the game. Loves getting tickets, loves some of the songs and loves a few other things on the program/app. I think she likes abcmouse better on the computer.",
Seems to be all about the money I've bought plenty of educational games but $60 a year is a bit too much. My daughter enjoyed playing the free trial but as with any child it only last for max 10mins till she is on to next app. So paying monthly or annual for child's app is just  silly & ridiculous. So sad some app makers have to be greedy when there is many good educational apps free or a tenth of the price compared to this one.,
My sister has learned so much using this and she actually likes It! No she loves it. Her speaking reading writing thinking flexibility have grown very quickly. She can already write her name and she is only 3. She knows the difference of capital and lowercase. She can count all the way to 50. I would recommend this app to everybody. I already have my three children accounts set up.,
"More often than not this app is frustrating. Parts of each learning path don't work, it randomly locks up and has to be uninstalled and reinstalled and the tech support answer is always the same ""please make sure you have the most current version of the app"" even after telling them the version is current. We will be canceling our subscription this time. We are done.",
"I bought an Asus transformer just to use ABC mouse on and come to find out, the ABC mouse app is not supported on my tablet. Bummer. I bought a tablet just for that reason. I made sure all updates were done on the tablet too. Very disappointed. The site itself is wonderful, however I don't have a desk top that my 2 year old can use. **This review is for this app, not ABC mouse as a whole.**",
It's a good app for learning if only the app would stay open long enough for it to be helpful. We have had the app for a year and my son will get a short amount of time (10-15 mins) before it freezes and closes. I've tried uninstalling the app then install again but we are still plagued with problems. My son really likes the app so I push on with it.,
I love how it is working for my son. He does so much better with this app than the learning activity books that I had bought for him. The only problem that I have is that it works better on my phone than my tablet. The puzzles tend to freeze up and not work properly on my tablet. Before and after the update.,
"we have had abcmouse for almost a year. The games are great and all the activities, but even with several updates it continuously freezes. My kids would spend lots of time on this app, bc they love all the activities, and just think they are playing and not learning. It is a great learning tool, and new things are added all the time. Only complaint I have is the freezing.",
They make you sign up for automatic billing before you can even try it. I don't trust any company that forces you to sign up for automatic payments.,
"My son is getting ready to start school and my daughter is two. I can set it up for both of them according to their learning ability levels, monitor them as they go and adjust their level of difficulty up or down if necessary. So, all the while they are learning they just think they're playing games on my phone! The only downfall is the extra money you have to pay for progress reports. It's a HUGE difference: $8.00 VS $80.00. For that price I may as well take on the role of Teacher. And so I do!!! ;-)",
I paid for a year getting a promotion and they been charging my account twice already. Its a ripoff,
My son loves this app.  Sadly he can only use it for a few minutes before it stops working on his tablet or overheats my phone. Some of the games freeze or don't work at all.,
"It's the best learning tool we've used. Our son has learned colors, letters, numbers, and more so quickly. Our youngest is almost two and we are planning on starting him using ABC mouse soon. The whole family loves it. Seriously, awesome.",
I can't even see what im doing because my thumb is too big for the drop down menus. Everything is too tiny and I've only just started making the profile! Not very well thought out. We'll see if the actual app is better than this.,
It's really great that my toddler is able to practice so many academic things before he even gets to preschool. As a former teacher it's wonderful to see how well he does and how he can read books and he's only 3.,
"This sight is awful I have tried  to cancel for months and they are,still taking money from my account my children no longer use it. This is a shame.",
They still charged me after I canceled a month ago. Not as good of an app as they say. Especially for the price I've paid for a year.,
None of my kids liked it (ages range 2-10) they said it was boring and didn't learn anything they didn't already know,
My kids have been using it for 2 years but for the past 6 months it has been acting up and freezes. It's ridiculous,
"I see all of these negative comments about ABCMouse and I just cannot fathom how.  My 2 year old loves this app!  She has learned her ABC's, colors, and some shapes.  You cannot just use this app alone, this is just a tool....not the teacher.",
I used ABC Mouse for my daughter from the time she was in Pk all the way until she was out of 1st grade. ABC Mouse is wonderful and great to homeschool with. Thanks ABC Mouse.,
My 3yr old love doing this he really learning new things everyday. My 6yr old love it as well it's help him with learning his sight words and improved his reading.,
My two year old gets bored really fast with it & it freeze often üòíüëé,
"The app keeps freezing during the learning path activities. Then the app crashes. Doesn't work.  Please fix this because we have a PAID subscription.  This is on a new 7"" ASUS tablet. It should work.",
"My boys love it.  So many different games,  books and more.  Way worth the money spent. Best thing is they are learning and having fun.",
I like this app very much. It is very difficult for my 9 year old to use anything educational. He doesn't hate this abc mouse. And that is as good as I'm going to get. Thanks!,
This is very misleading. The app says free but once you install it they say first month free. Uninstalling because I wanted it for when I have my grandchildren who won't use it that often for a monthly fee.,
"My grandson  and spent the summer with ABC Mouse he will be going into Preschool 3 next month that knowing his shapes,colors, and counting from 1-20",
If ABC really cared about the children's future this would be free. This sucks it's just games and it made my kids really bored then I tired to cancel it and it wouldn't let me I had to cancel my bank card because once you try to cancel it gives you a pixelated screen. A network with so much money makes people pay for this,
This company deliberately makes it very difficult to cancel. We have been billed for this for a year and still can't figure out how to cancel. Website has no links to cancel and if you click a link to cancel it takes you to the wrong page. Very corrupt company. Be warned!!,
"I gotta say I was very upset at first because I got charged even when I clicked the free trial, and I was not expecting that. The games seem a bit too easy. I wrote them an email since I was really upset, and I could not get assistance right away. I called customer service who called me the next day. To my surprise the lady was very nice and offered to refund the money and to keep the free trial.",
ABC Mouse is great for children. My grandchildren open the ABC Mouse app and stay on it for quite some time not realizing they're learning all the time.,
Need help to cancel my account I keep getting the run around on how to cancel it and can't get to talk to a representative,
I cannot recommend it because I cannot get anything to come up.  It took my money.,
The billed me $19.95 for 6 months when the app says $7.95. What a way to rip off customers. And my 4 year old hates it. I have to force her to play it.,
"We were really excited to purchase this app, unfortunately my daughter became bored almost instantly. Also, I never agreed to get billed and got billed anyway. When I talked to them on the phone, they said they had a strict no refund policy, very disappointed!",
theres issues with certain  activities and they freeze or don't let us start at all,
I find this is real crap that I have to pay for this app. Why can't it be free so that children can learn,
It truely si worth having  Este. Cit√≥ es lo m√°ximo les ense√±an y juegan todo. En uno,
This app is extraordinary. My children really love it. There are so many activites. They enjoy it and i highly recommend parents to get this app.The app is very educational.,
Very disappointed in this site. Subscribed to ABC Mouse and it wasn't supported on any of my devices.  Now I'm having a horrible time cancelling the subscription. ..,
My step daughter likes it but it keeps crashing so she's lost ALL interest.,
"Yes, my daughter does find it boring, but I know she is learning things. Because she does not need help 99percent of the time. However, i do have a technical issue, the learning path will not move forward. It will give her tickets but will not let her move onto the next activity. HELP!!!!",
"My 2 yr old son loves playing this app. The only thing is it would be great if you added more offline games and puzzles, or at least changed them up a bit.",
My daughter loves it. It's great that you can change grade level as they  get older.,
Kept closing out whenever my son chose an activity...I happily paid for an app I can't use... If it worked then wed be able to rate it above useless,
This is shown as a free app.  You download but can't use until you join with a membership and credit card.  Very deceiving,
My daughter loves the app but her tablet keeps getting removed from the compatible list. I guess i will be cancelling our subscription,
"Wish i could speak on quality of the content as i just cant use this app consistently for my kids, doesnt work on ipad, doesnt work on note 3, slowest app i have seen",
My son really likes this app. Too bad he can't play it. I have even paid for a subscription still every update the crashes seem to happen more.,
"Got this for my daughter for her 2nd bday & she absolutely loves it! She asks to play ""school"" all the time & has learned so much since I've had it that it amazes me!",
My kids love ABC mouse. I see that they have learned more than what they already know. They should have one that teaches spanish.,
I love abc mouse and my kids love it but with that being said i downloaded it on their tablet and after a minute of being on it then it crashes. Very disappointed. Please hurry to fix this issue.,
"I love that this is an activity my kids can do independently. At first my son was on a lesson that wasnt challenging enough, so he was getting bored. I switched the level, and his excitement increased!",
App glitches on Samsung galaxy note tab. Wont open and if open runs slow with glitches,
"I wanted to cancel my account and ABC mouse required a download of the app before I could do it. If I'm cancelling, I shouldn't have to get the app for the account I no longer want.",
"Needs more control settings. Lags really bad at times which can be confusing for little ones. Little too ""open world"", needs more linear progression.",
"If the app is good, let us try it without having to put in a credit card.  I will gladly pay for it after the trial if it is good, but don't want the hassle of having to cancel.",
My 4 year old loves ABC Mouse.  It keeps her entertained while still learning.,
Won't let my kids play Aney games on the learning path please fix,
My kids 5 and 2 years old love this. They both think it's a game.They enjoy collecting the tickets given after completing an activity.,
Every once in awhile it has issues running and logs out.,
My daughter loves playing all of the learning games. There is so much for her to do that it does very well at keeping her attention! Overall amazing app!,
Bought a table for my child to use ABC Mouse during the summer and app crashed before loading e everytime.,
"I purchased the ABC in office using the desktop and even accessing it to my samsung phone. I want to download it to apple ipad but asking for the payment information., which i only need is the application to log in. If i continue to give the payment info, are they automatically billed me? Thanks.",
I did the free trial being told I wouldn't be charged and I've been charged for two months. It's impossible to speak to an actual person. Even though I'm being charged the app wouldn't allow my daughter access to Anthing stating wed need to pay to have the access. Horrible just don't bother,
Very good tool to have for your kid(s) to learn. Has lots of activities and is easy to use. Makes learning fun! & if you do not want your kid(s) only using the tablet or whatever there are activities you can print out for your kid(s) to use. My 2 yr old daughter loves this app. Worth spending your money on this amazing app especially if it's to benefit your kid(s).,
My children absolutely love this application and it's so perfect for each age. It's really great that all this learning material is in one convenient app for each age group. I always recommend this application to people.,
Our daughter has been doing awesome with this whole program. This has made learning fun for her. She says she can't wait to start school now,
After downloading then it tells you 30 day free trial. There are plenty of other educational apps that are truly free.,
I loved it .it totally helped my little sister she would cry when I had to take it away,
My 2 year old loves it. He gets so excited playing it and he is learning so much while having fun.,
My 3yo really enjoys it.. she's learned so much in just the last 2 weeks. Highly recommended,
Great on Note 5 my 3 year old loves the songs and because he can hold the phone and touch the screen its a lot better getting him to learn (been using this for almost 2 years),
"Overall a great app. Unfortunately there is a Lil bug, as my son does his learning path, his avatar will walk back to the last environment  completed.  Frustrating.  But the other areas seem fine.",
Mission accomplished. My kids love it they didn't know they are learning because is fun.,
This is helpful for my little brother it helps him and he is just 3,
My 3 year old loves this app but it keeps freezing. Great learning tool.,
Great programs. I wish they had it for all grades. It is not boring at all. If it is for some then find something else. This program is geared for a lot of speacial interests for young minds. I love it.,
"My 3 year old loves it. It has a tendency to freeze up a bit during puzzles, but that could be an issue with my hardware.",
I used this program for my daughter when she was 4 or 5. (She's 13 now). To see this program boom as fast as it has is awesome. My 5 year old son LOVES this. It keeps him active and keeps his memory going throughout the school year as well as the summer.,
We love it. They've improved many bugs. Thanks!,
My 3 year old loves it. She enjoys the songs and getting the tickets. The only thing is that on the tablet sometimes it takes a long time to load.,
My toddlers don't really realise that they are learning when they use this and they have fun.,
I'd like to see the developers make the app accessible when I'm under ground on the train. My kid like to play it but can't cuz we obviously have no service in the tunnels.,
Since the update it won't load. Please fix!,
I like ABCMOUSE. But it will not play on the app,
My 3 year old has learned so much feom this site so fast.,
I have 2 kids that play on this site.  My oldest child is a bit advanced for it but likes it anyway.  My youngest loves it.,
But the app is constantly kicking her out...like every four minutes,
"Both my boys love ABC Mouse! It's educational, easy to navigate and fun! I highly recommend ABC Mouse!",
Worked well at first. Now my nephew will finish the puzzle and it will not move on.,
A friend signed up my boys for a year and I've seen so much progress with their vocabulary and understanding letters and numbers.  But they have fun doing it! It's really great. üòç,
Plenty of free apps that can teach the same stuff.,
My 2 yr old and 5 yr old love this app. My 5 yr old loves earning tickets for his hamster.,
My daughter started abcmouse at 2 yrs old and she is 3 now and can read at 1st grade level. She loves everything about it and I can't wait to get my son started this year!,
"I love the way my grandson can work on his own, and when we work together it specifically goes to what he needs to work on!! I love this program!! Best decision I have made purchasing this!üòÇüòÇ",
"Im so happy I purchased thd year plan! My 5 year and 3 yr old love this soo much, i can already see them improving each day on all skill levels!",
It is very easy for my three year old to use. He enjoys the variety of games and songs it offers,
My son loves to play. The only problem we have a problem is that his tickets don't always show up on the side of the screen or they show up the next day when he hasn't even played.,
Excellent my daughter love's it very much!! Different lessons are the best plus other activities and coloring!!! Thank you for this program!!! She has learned so much!!!,
My son knows his alphabet and how to count to 20 by the time he was 2.  He loves the books read to him and the puzzle games.,
Love this app. My son and daughter want to play and learn all day. Keep up the good work.,
ABC Mouse has helped my sons tremendously! They have learned so much and absolutely love being on it. Kudos to you for offering such a wonderfully engaging app for kids!,
My son is just a toddler and he's already learned a lot. Can't wait to see how far he'll go in ABC mouse!,
My son is 15 months old and absolutely loves it. He is learning so fast thanks to ABC Mouse,
My two and five yr old love ABC mouse. Love the site words for my kindergartener,
My granddaughter was having trouble getting ready for school.  She now plays this 2 hours a day and has progressed at an amazing pace!  Thank you!,
Kid can't wait to play. Is learning much more than reading and arithmetic.,
My kids are too young to have their own cell phone and they have a tablet that they are allowed to play with sometimes that is our family tablet I wish that you had a version that I could download on the tablet instead of having to let them use my phone and that way they can play it whenever they want instead of just when I'm home.,
Both of my daughter love it and my oldest starts school... This is a blessing she loves to learn.,
Does not all ways work! On computer or tablet! If it did I would have given 5stares,
My daughters love this site!! Learning so much all while thinking I'm letting them play games!!,
It helps kids learn and my  little  sister  is  learning  so  much.,
"Awesome it works so good I recommend  this app the best site you're kids can learn at with good price!,‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫",
"Love this app! It has been amazing for both my kids, thank you!",
This app is constantly freezing; leaving my 3 year old extremely frustrated and upset thinking he is doing things wrong!! How can he learn anything when the doesn't work properly?! And this is a paid app!!,
We enjoy the...really keepshim alert.  I noticed people complaining about it not working well on phone...well duh!  Its too much for a phone and dont buy cheap tablets....works fine on all of our ipads....notes.....tablet....nabi,
A lot of times the puzzle pieces do not appear or do not rotate.,
Really good program for childre. My grandkids love it. And they are learning!,
"My daughter loves the puzzles, tickets, levels and learning from this engaging program! Thank you!",
My kids love this application. They stay busy for hours!,
Sometimes when he clicks on things it doesn't work.. slow,
I love this app. I have seen how much my daughter is learning. It is amazing!,
My 5 year old loves it! Great during the summer too!,
So far no complaints. My daughter is enjoying mouse and seems to be learning from it.,
"My grandson, nieces and friend's kids LOVE this app! It's wonderful to be able to trust the content of an online application with no reservations. Keep up the great work!!",
Not compatible,
Proud parent,
My 4 year old love this all keep up the good work guys.,
"My 3 years old is doing awesome, this site is amazing!",

Thanks to abc mouse my daughter is prepared to begin online kindergarten with confidence.,
My son loves this app. And it's education win win,

Its really helped my child to communicate better.,
Great for my granddaughter  she loves it and is learning so much. Thank you ABC mouse,

Nice app to keep you child busy on long drives,
They can practice how to write using a tablet and stylus as well as sing songs and watch little videos.,
Awesome app for learing...don't  be cheap...pay for this app for your children  and watch them learn.,
I dont want your suscription!,
I'm 14years old n i still love the game it's fun lol,

My daughter learned to read at 3 years of age thanks to ABCMouse and homeschooling! Thanks ABCMouse!,
Children really work for those tickets!!,
Wouldnt let me cancel and too many glitches fix it,
My daughter learns more everyday couldn't ask for more,
"My children are really enjoying this app. I have a 6, 5, & 4yr old using it. I love it!!! They use it all the time and dont realize that its educational. It is worth the üí∞",
My son likes playing this and learns from it,
My kids love this and its nice to have on actabley,
Kid loves it even though he always jacks my phone,
Helped both my children get ahead of the curve before kindegarten,
My son and I love using this to help him learn,

Always froze not worth the purchase.,

This is the best app u can ever have. My three old son  loves it and he likes it when u get tickets and can actually spend them. I love it how I can keep up with his assignment and know what he's actually doing. Only problem that I'm having is that it stop working on his tablet just a yellow screen and that just started to happen other than that it's still a great app.,
"My daughter is four and she uses many apps independently, but she rarely can accomplish much in abc mouse unless i am helping her. Not like the commercials where the kids are just learning using the app by themselves. I find many of the activities not very educational. Very basic content",
"It was designed for laptops and desktops, certain mobile devices can't handle the processing it takes to keep up. Works on my s4 my s5 and laptop just fine but my iPad it glitches I disable the learning path and that enabled most of the functions to run fine. Great app my daughter loves it.",
I have a Droid Turbo 2 and this app is incredibly slow. On my Nexus 7 it's almost unusable. Plus the lack of play store integration and requirement for a credit card for the free month with multiple offers to upgrade with immediate billing is a massive turnoff. Canceling after 15 minutes and won't bother again.,
"My daughter loves ABC mouse. She graduated level one and is taking on the challenges in the new lessons of level two. Very happy and always  impressed that at the age for 4 how much she knows without being in preschool, since where we live it's very hard to afford it.",
"My son was having a hard time in school to where I wanted to hold you back in the first grade, but then I found this app. Now both of my boys I love it and I can see a big change in their grades. So I would like to thank you ABCmouse",
About a month after downloading the app for my daughter it stopped loading.  I attempted to contact the company 2 weeks ago from the customer support link on the website and never heard back from them.  I will admit that it's an okay tool for children but good luck getting any help when it stops working.,
I've been using ABCmouse with my kids for years now. Now my one-year-old just started using it and she loves it she's learning really fast. Only thing I don't like is the menu on the side of the screen my daughter accidentally tapped on it and it will send her back to the home screen I would like it if you can remove this like it did on the PC version back with ABC Mouse started,
"Our 4-year old grandson loves it, and learns a good deal. It works perfectly on our Samsung S2. However, like others on here, we get the dreaded blank yellow screen, after logging in with our Asus Tab. Would readily give this 5 stars if the developers would simply respond to those noting the issue, either with an acknowledgement or with an intended fix.",
Paid and went through the whole set up process. To then get a yellow screen when I hit next. No matter how many times I reload it doesn't work. My daughter was so excited to play and now she can't because it won't load. I'd like my money back if this is what I paid for.,
"This is great for my boys, when it works... Constantly glitching across different platforms, computer (windows 10), and android app. Doesn't load pages correctly, so my son and I have done the same activity at least 20 times and it will not recognize that it is completed even after you press the continue button and receive tickets for competition. Customer support is garbage, the site and app make it hard to even submit a problem, and good luck getting a response or solution.",
"I am disappointed that I had to load this app when I wanted to open the desktop version in my browser on my phone. It would not open and I HAD to put yet another app on my phone that I will need to delete later because I simply wanted to check the renewal date for our subscription.  Otherwise, we love the program and our son loves it.  If I can open in my phone browser and am not made to download an app I will gladly give it 5 stars.",
"We love ABC mouse, it's everything they say it is but the app keeps crashing my phone and iPad. I shouldn't have to remove the battery just to get out of the app. It freezes whenever my kids check certain pets. Fix that and I'll give 5 stars, if not I want my subscription ended.",
I love the app my child and I will sit and play it for hours. The only down side is that it is a little to easy for her to back out of a game or story before she is done. Maybe if you added something like having to pull the back button to anouther location to help younger children from doing this when playing on touch screen and I would give it a full 5 stars.,
"Had this app awhile w paid subscription, had no problems, then day after the 4/21/16 update it stopped working on my daughter's tablet. Called company and they claimed never heard of this problem, must be something wrong w/ my tablet. Went to store to get new tablet, found out it wouldn't download to that tablet, either, even though the TECHNICIAN there tried everything he could do to try and make it work. THE UPDATE SEEMS FLAWED!! abcmouse is claiming they haven't had any complaints, but there is an issue.",
I am very disappointed. I paid for this program on my iPad for my son. At first I was very happy to see that it was available on my son's Android tablet. However after downloading it and logging in the program never loads. The screen remains yellow as if it is still loading but displays nothing. I have tried everything to get it to work and it still won't. This needs to be fixed so that other parents don't have to rely on using it on an iPad only.,
"I've been paying for our account for over a year now, and while the premise is sound and the program has been nothing but beneficial, whether on tablet, phone, or computer, it's so full of bugs that it's barely usable lately. I can't get a response from customer service to save my life. The app closes itself every few minutes, the learning path hangs on activities and there's no way to manually progress through them - it's frustrating.",
We use ABC primarily on a nabi tablet. It is a little glitchy and cumbersome to use in some areas of the app. Also for a paid app the prizes games and animals are vanilla and corny even for a 5 year olds standards. That being said it has become a useful learning tool . Contrary to the commercials though my kid is not excited to play he still knows it's school,
"Love ABCMouse, but if u r going to take money from my account automatically, u need to provide a quality app that doesnt crash. I have apps that are free along with educational and NEVER has crashed on me. Im not going to keep paying for this just to have it frustrate my children. Fix it or ill tell everyone and there mamas not to get this app and qill cancel my membership. My children are homeschooled and thought this would help.",
"I installed & set up on my Samsung Galaxy s6, paid for it & all then put it on my son's asus tablet only to get stuck on a light yellow screen. Get it together or I'll be asking for a refund! No wonder why it was on sale",
"I signed up for ABC Mouse for the free month option & you have to pick after free month whether you want to pay monthly or for 1 year which was $59 so I chose the year & downloaded the application. At first I was excited as I set everything up for my grandson but I continually kept getting kicked out of program in the middle of activity & had to keep logging back in. I rebooted, uninstalled, reinstalled, same thing over & over. Submitted a help ticket, emailed for troubleshooting, no response. Submitted a request to cancel subscription & 24 hours later received an email stating subscription has been cancelled, your last payment of $59 was received on 05/29/16 & your card will not be billed again, you can continue to enjoy ABC Mouse through 05/31/17. Now I am out $59 & no I can't enjoy the program because it does not work. I just read tons of complaints & nobody has ever been able to get a refund from this company so do not be fooled by their 1 month free offer because it is their way of scamming you out of your money. Google negative reviews for this company. I wish I had of before I got scammed! Shame on you ABC Mouse!",
My 3 year old son is a nonverbal autistic child.  This truly helping talk... At least try.  And that is a God send!  He has only been using it for a month or so.  We are very pleased and will continue to use it.  And we used it for my now 4 year old daughter and she is absolutely amazing everyday in every way...this is money well sent!!!,
"I thought this might be a good program for my 2.5 year old, but it runs so slowly on my tablet that it is useless. She love jigsaw puzzles, but she couldn't get the pieces to go where she wanted because there was so much lag time. So she told me ""this piece goes there"" and I tried I couldn't get it to work either. With the books the audio lags behind the words. How is it superposed to help her learn to read if the audio doesn't match the text.  Plus I was very disappointed in the lessons and activities. They didn't seem well set up for actually teaching the material. The interface is also not very intuitive for a child. Defiantly won't be getting a subscription. There are many other much better and much less expensive apps out there.",
False advertising. The app is free to download. Immediately upon opening you have to login. Logging in requires a monthly paid membership. NOT a free app.,
"I haven't been able to get the app to load on any of my devices. It worked fine for the first couple of weeks, then it just stopped working. I'm very frustrated, and my child is upset, he really enjoyed it while it worked. Guess, I just wasted my money on a year subscription.",
Not sure how we like it yet.   Have been having issues with the app.  Finally got it to download and open on my phone.,
"I love the app for my kids, but take one star away customer service needs improvement. Parents should be able to speak to someone abount issuses i just left my second email in two weeks about my account being charged twice a month",
"My daughter isn't even two yet, and she's able to count to 4, tell me where her eyes, nose, mouth, and ears are, distinguish between primary colors, and speak in small succinct sentences. I love abcmouse! She's learning so much so quickly, and she really loves doing this. I definitely recommend it!",
It teach your kids some many thing. My granddaughter when she star she don't want to stop doing the levels.,
My 2 year old loves it. I made the mistake of putting this on my phone's home page and whenever she sees me unlock my phone we end up playing ABC mouse for an hour.  At first I thought she was just swiping but I realize she has learned alot.,
The best educational app ever my son love to learn now and doesn't want to stop playing ever even when it's bed time,
"My son loves it, I love that it teaches on his level. But sometimes it gets stuck on amlesson thatbweve already completed and it doesn't let you mive on. Ours is currently stuck on a lesson that he has done 6 times and its not registering as done. Frustrating",
Boring. Daughter loses interest quickly. It's not worth paying for. The same material is seen on Babyfirst. And that's free.,
Works better on my computer. All I get on my tablet is  yellow screen. I would give five stars if it would work on my tablet.,
My two year old loves it and I love it because he thinks it's just a game but he's learning things that only kids twice his age would normally be learning in school. Highly recommended,
"have tried to use it 3 times today. there is no sound, and none of the activities are working. giant waste of time.",
"It uninstalled off of my sons tablet, and is now saying the app isn't compatible. I paid nearly 100 bucks for the year subscription. Fix it please.",
"My child has the APP on a tablet. It freezes often and  doesnt always give tickets for activites. Often times the ""done"" button doesnt work after activities. I have to restart it multiple times which interrupts learning",
When I downloaded the app and open it just a orange screen pops up. It doesn't work. I've even tried deleting the app and downloading it again. Same problem,
My Daughter loves it she did not want to go to school so I installed this and it's awesome same thing with my son,
Well as soon as i opened the app it asked me to sign up and once i read it more i saw that you have to pay money for it.,
"Not too sure if it the device I am attempting to use it on or the app itself, but will get kicked off every time trying to use.",
"This is a great app for kids, but it freezes up far too often... too much time wasted waiting for it to unfreeze... They need to fix the freezing... or ill stop payment and opt for other paid apps.",
I think this would be great for a regular child but for an Autistic not that great. My daughter has problems with verbal communication and doesn't understand verbal directions so when asked to click on the white board she doesn't understand that direction so it is a struggle.,
"This would be a great app if it ever worked right. Crashes, freezes, doesn't save lessons my daughter has already completed so she has to do them multiple times. Very disappointed with this app.",
I love this app and really the whole program for my daughter. I do wish there was an option to play at least some things offline but no big complaint there.,
Never once opened.  Every time I clicked an option it kicked me out of the app.,
My son has done the same game over and over again and it does not let him move on. I've updated it several times and it still does not let him move on. Please fix soon if he can't move on I will be uninstalling the app.,
child not interested. plenty of other free apps that do the same thing. not only do u pay monthly but when u start it then u pay for other features.. wast of money. unsubsidized and still charged me twice,
"Games are fun for me and my daughter to play together and helps her learn without her realizing she's learning,  so much better then trying to get her to focus and go over flashcards and other learning materials!!! Would recommend to everyone with children",
Great program and so fun. She doesn't even see it as learning. Just fun& games and bonus LEARNING,
My son is autistic and the jigsaw puzzles have helped him learn easier and have fun. The app is easy to use and is extremely helpful. I suggest it to all of my friends with kids.,
My son has a speech problem and this app helps him out a lot with his words and numbers,
I have not been able to use the app since the last update. Neither me nor my daughter are happy about this. Other than that I would give it 4 stars,
The additional skills of education learned has my daughter communicating at a 6 to 7 year old level and she's only 4. Thank you.,
It's don't say on the TV that the grade goes higher than 1st grade I payed for nothing,
"The app was great in the beginning. However, there is no sound with the app now and I can find no means to resolve it. Not very useful without sounds.",
My child loves it but we have a ellipse for  kids and always have trouble opening the app it always says it's not responding.  Please fix,
"My daughter can't stay away from it. She learned so much,  her language power is amazing.  I love abcmouse",
"I got this to check it out, my son's still a little to young for it but it will definitely be used a lot when he becomes 2.",
"5 stars if you could play all games on a tablet, not all games are compatiable, which is a little disappointing for both child & parent.",
"I love ABC mouse, it has my 4 year old daughter engaged and ready to learn.",
I loved the trial and payed for one year. A month into us using it ...it starts to load and then freezes. I have sent 4 email to the company with no response. Also tried the phone number listed got no where with it either,
"Got everything (learning path, pet path, zoo, tickets and finally Graduation) to keep kids learning easy..",
Can't even play it. Freezes every time it's open and now need to cancel membership,
Does seem to lag a bit and hard for my 6 year old child to pick up things and move them.,
Was very disappointed in this app it shows its free but you have to sign up and pay for it after you download it. Was hoping my 3 yr old could play on this but I deleted it.,
The first ever I was going to kindergarten I was failing so my mom found ABC mouse üòäüòäüòä,
I got this for my 2 year old. She likes the music. But wish the games on was easy enough for her to do.,
Just downloaded the app.  Logged in then yellow screen. Won't go any further.   Installed then deleted then reinstalled but no luck,
"I'm trying to keep my child learning during the summer, but this app keeps force closing on him. Every time he starts doing a lesson it closes on him. So frustrating.",
My 23 month old son and 11 month old daughter absolutely loves abc mouse....both get really excited when they hear the app loading,
So far I love ABCmouse. But the app constantly freezes. I wish I could just use it online on my tablet.,
"Was working,  then after I updated my payment method, it quit working.",
"Both my daughter, 4, and my son, 2, play on ABC Mouse. They love the games and the virtual pets they care for. I enjoy watching them play and learn through this program.",
He has learned so much and really enjoys earning tickets to buy animals...etc and I love the classroom with lesson plans!,
I love this app it's amazing and keeps my 3 year old busy and helps her learn at the same time,
The concept is great. My daughter is very active and this app actually keeps her attention. Only issue is lately it hasn't been working on her tablet. So now I'm going to try it on my phone again. It usually works great.,
If you choose to upgrade and pay for the year you lose your 30 day free trial and they charge your credit card immediately ...I would like to see words highlighted when the app is ready the story to my child so she  can follow along with the words especially when learning to read,
Money was taken out of my account as if yesterday. 7.95 and my son can't logg on because it's asking me for more money. First month is supposed to be free. Please clear this up asap,
"Easier to navigate on our phones. My son and daughter almost break our tablet's screens trying to scroll and manipulate/ move objects in this app. When they can get through activities, they enjoy and get to practice necessary skills.",
Freezes on a yellow screen after welcoming you to acc mouse. Very disappointed after years of hearing all the hype and finally deciding to download it for my son and nothing.,
"Everything here is created to teach your child. Things are simple and repetitive, because that's how children learn. If you read the introductory material, it explains it.",
Day care center closed unexpectly. He needs to continue learning.,
My 2 year old son is in this and is like a day he was learning colors I can't believe how well he is doing,
It goes to the and mouse section and then it's a blank screen constantly.,
It's great when it's working and not freezing.  It seems to freeze a lot on our iPad and tablet.,
Keeps talking money out of my bank account even though I never approved  renewing.,
My sis year old daughter has been using this app for a couple years. I can track her development and customize her tasks. It's great.,
I love how much fun my daughter has playing this app and it'd recommend to anyone !,
"Blank yellow screen on our tablet, but the app works fine on our phones, and no issues with the website on our computer. I'm on the fence if it is worth the price, but having an ad-free learning tool at our fingertips is a great benefit.",
Doesn't work. It no longer opens after updating. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and that didn't work. It just keeps crashing after the start screen. Please fix this. I should be able to use what I'm paying for.,
I started my daughter on it  a few months after she turned two. She enjoys going on it. It enhanced her learning experience. I'm looking  forward  to new features!,
I got my son a new tablet an installed the ABC app an after I sign in it stays yellow an don't open I am paying for it I would like him to be able to play.... Please help asap,
Just a yellow screen. It is not my phone. Please fix and I will give you a better rating,
I just wish we had the option to pay a one time fee to buy the entire software per grade level,
"Sometimes it does weird things and you can't get into areas of the app or can't find things . Other then that it's a great app , my son has learned a lot from it and I would recommend it for any family .",
My son don't play it or like it &' would like it if it didn't take my money every month,
Fix your app have not been able to use it for a few weeks now . my kids love it when they're able to use it. I will cancel my membership if not fixed soon. So frustrating paying for something and not able to use it .,
My child is stuck on a game that repeats its self. She competed it 5 times. Each time it goes back to the learning path but doesn't clear the game and she can't skip it,
Would rate higher but can't keep affording the price. Please lower it and I will give 5 stars. Not to mention it won't load up fully anymore. It goes to the log in screen then freezes up.,
I downloaded this app and right off the back it loaded only twice on my phone. I have to wait until my husband comes home to use his laptop. It literally freezes at the intro. Please fix. Our daughters hate waiting to do their assignments.,
Our youngest began using it at 18 months and we love it! His vocabulary and comprehension have soared above our expectations. Thank you ABC Mouse.,
"As much as I would like to use this app on my tablet I can't. I love what it has to offer, only wish I could use it for my son on his or my tablet :(",
Unable to get past a yellow screen on a tablet with WiFi but no data plan.,
I can't  even say if it's good or bad.  Just downloaded and it isn't working. Very upset right now because my son can't do anything. All I see is a yellow screen. I bet I don't pay for this!,
This is a great program and it works. My son is 1 years old and is learning very well. Thanks ABC Mouse,
"Just a yellow screen, it did work until last update. My account still works on desktop, just messed up on tablet. Please fix, if not fixed soon I will cancel subscription.",
"Works great. My only complaint is that when my phone is low on memory space, it won't register the levels as completed and therefore my son can't move on to his next lesson.",
"My son loves it, but in the middle of using it, it closes itself out. Makes him frustrated then he doesn't want to play it anymore. Need to fix please.",
Absolutely worth every penny. My 3 year old son has improved immensely. Along with my 4 year old daughter,
My 2 year old autistic boy knows his ABC's can count to 20 because of this app worth the money and easy for him to play and get on it by phone or own tablet,
Content is decent but the loading time is so slow most of the time that even a 2.5 year old loses interest quickly,
I luv the app..I use some areas of the learning material for my autistic child + my other non autistic children but wish they had a password 2 control it bcuz my autistic song likes 2 sing in new out of the app,
When I open it on the tablet it doesn't load. I log in and thats it blank screen,
Kinda stupid because it would be much better if you started the free trial first so then you could see if you like it or not!,
"Runs a little slower on the phone than the website, but no glitches or any major problems to report. My daughter loves this app!",
Can't reset my password to cancel my trial. Requested link everyday for almost a week and nothing. My daughter doesn't use it so I don't want it,
The apps on my phone but doesn't work on any of my tabs.,
"After April's latest patch, it will not load. Please fix this!",
Can't get out of it!  Cancelled and they are still taking money!,
Absolutely  love this for my son and my students! Keeps them engaged and they love earning tickets to buy things!!!,
"Make sure you utilize the first month for free.. my son won't get on this app at all, he's very bored with it after 2 days :( also, they said $60 for the year, charged me $80 , called them and horrible customer service...",
I love this app my daughter is on it literally everyday especially after homework. Shes having fun and also learning at the same time zo she enjoys  it. ABC mouse is worth the investment for your child,
"I would have gave you 5 stars if my son was able to actually get on it and learn! I was able to make an account, make our avatars, but when I chose to start all I got was a yellow screen. Please fix",
"Every time I launch it, I have to sign in with the username & password!! Talk about kicking potential customers out!",
My children literally begging me every second every hour to play this game,
"It's supposed to be highly educational,  but everything on here my 3yr already knows and what he doesn't is too boring to engage him in it",
My daughter is always asking me to play it and has learned so much!,
Kids love playing it. Very easy for them to navigate through it on their own and very educational.,
Amazing my daughter has learned soo much and is only 2 and a half years! Very well done!,
"My Daughter has been playing this for a year now and her speech, reading and motor skills are astonishing! Highly recommend!",

I have two girls ages 5 & 2 they both love to play on ABCMouse! My 5 y.o. can do it by her self and even loves doing the learning path thanks to the bonus 20 tickets at the end of each lesson! My 2 y.o. is always right there when her sister is playing and I play with her as well on her own learning path! Great Totally worth the $8.00 a month and u get up-to 3 kids profiles üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,
My four year old granddaughter loves it! She loves the lessons and earning her tickets to buy things.,

The best thing ever for my 4 year old.,
The games and mucic videos are great!!!! As far as the lesson plans they could be more challenging then what they are. The library books the word could be highlighted as it being read to. This app is not all that great its ok.,

"Kids love it, we have it already for 4 months and they play it every day. So many educational staff inside! Songs, games, tracing letters...",
I am pleased to find an app that my son enjoys that teaches him as well.,
"Does a great job with my toddler, especially with speech.",

This app sucks. I pay $7.95 a month and it won't download to my Android phone. I want reimbursed and will never try it again. Buyer beware,
Nothing but rate,
No sound?,
"No way to get in touch other than email, and the jokers keep sending the same canned responses",
Classroom,
Aiden,
Yeah,
"I  purchased this for my 4 yr old grand baby. She is always asking me to spell words. So, when I would in tern ask her to spell a word for me it would be every letter but the right letter. I  then saw the commercial for ABC mouse and the rest is history.",
Debbie,
It was not all it is dubbed up to be on tv. Which the tv commercials are badly edited. What parents say on them is just peiced together and doesn't even flow. My 2 yr old and 6 yr old were bored with it but i guess because its what they already know. I even messed with it and it bored me to cancel before the first day was over.,
But my two-year-old keeps logging herself out which makes it super frustrating for me since you can't save your password and login information! Please fix ASAP that you have to go into parent mode to log it out at least in the toddler mode anyways!,
"lots of good content, and my kid loves getting tickets.  app is very sluggish and sometimes almost unresponsive even on my transformer 701t.  not fun when puzzles and other activities respond slow to touch.  it can also tend to confuse him.  optimize the app so that it can run on a kids tablet plz. if last update optimized anything, I couldn't tell.",
There are so many glitches and bugs that I have repeatedly emailed them to fix. I get a generic email saying they are looking into it but it never gets fixed. It was a waste of money to buy a year's subscription because my 4 year old stopped liking it because it doesn't work right.,
Loves it,
"I think the idea is great.  Though for the parents to complain about it not being free. If you payed any attention to the commercials, they tell you it's free to download and that it's less than $10 a month. If your child's education isn't worth ten bucks a month. Don't complain about such a great program. I'm buying this for my 4 year old.",
I have been waiting for this to be available on androids and it must still be new. When I click on the app it only shows the logo but no skip button and it just repeats the opening logo. Next when we click on the whiteboard nothing happens even sometimes when we just want to get into a lesson it will remain blank I enjoy the curriculum created for them when it works. Just minor but reason for paying problems like being able to actually do the lessons without it just remaining. Blank,
"I got this for my 2 year old to help get a headstart on her education. Sadly the app is not suited for kids that young, even though it claims to be. There's way too many buttons for her to press, she ends up leaving the activities without meaning to which causes her frustration. The toddler activities are too confusing for her, she can't do any of them without supervision because she just doesn't understand what to do. App freezes constantly, or just doesn't load. Glad I get 1 month free, canceling for sure",
I love this program. My kids love it as well. The only thing we could ask would be an app that worked on cheaper slower tablets. Both my kids got tablets for Christmas and abc mouse app does not work on them. Ugh was trying to set it so my laptop and phone were not always in use for abc mouse.,
"So, just to clarify with all you confused consumers out there, the APP is free. However, you DO have to have a paid subscription to use it's features. The site is actually pretty cool and only 7.95 a month (with a free 30 day trial of course). My daughter is 5 and LOVES this. ^_^ Mommy approved!",
"App continues to shut itself down in the middle of play and/or signs my daughter out over n over. Can't access certain parts of the game like the ""what's new"" section.  Used to be great but gets worse with each new update. Cancelling",
My kids love it. But it's really annoying that with the app that is on the phone constantly won't let my kids continue on the learning path. So they always have to replay something over and over just because the stupid continue thing doesn't pop up.... How are they suppose to keep learning on their path of they are stuck on the same thing. They really need to fix this. I have no problems with going online on the computer. It shouldn't be this difficult for an app that kids use all the time.,
Teacher account would love to have access to lesson plans and also the settings to children's accounts. Are you ever going to get it done?  *new update like how I have some kids settings now but why is on my computer I can lock them out of things but not on the app for example the bedroom that has no educational value and they just get confused on what to do in there...when will that be part of an update been like that for over a year!,
"I am glad i could add 3 kids. Whenever they ask to use my phone they can learn and have fun all with this app. It gets them ready to start school and whenever they don't have homework, they get on here just for a little extra learning.",
"My son is a big fan, and the amount of educational tools they pack into every game is awesome! We can track his progress and he loves to share everything he's learned. He has been playing since he was 2, and has just turned 4, he is a bright cookie, and this has definitely helped him excel and keep him challenged in many apects!",
This is a very dishonest company. They were charging us twice a month for a monthly subscription but denied it when we brought it up to their support. I provided them proof from my bank statement and they still refused to refund all the extra money.,
"My daughter's pre-k class uses this so I thought I would try it. I am very protective of online information so I don't understand why you need her birthday.  Currently I can't pass the page asking me to select a ""skin color!"". Why can't the avatar be generic?  I'm cancelling now because I can't get pass the setup. Update: Since I can't get pass setup I can't cancel the subscription. so I ether complete set up with fake info or contact my credit card...this sucks. But at least I can share this with the other parents.",
"Good program, horrible app",
"For an app with a monthly payment I expect much more, they must be spending all the money on commercials.",
"My six year old loves ABC Mouse. This learning academy is the best thing to ever happen to online learning for children. All those other apps are absolutely nothing compared to ABC Mouse. When my daughter becomes old enough,  she'll be using it also. I only wish I had started my son sooner!!!",
My 3-year-old son loves this program! He has flown through nearly 4 levels since purchasing this 3 months ago. Its amazing how it keeps him entertained and every day he learns something new. Highly recommend.,
if it cant be fixed i will just be cancelling my membership becausewhat's the point if i canr use it,
And the teachers you think press here too nevermind I want to say it this is Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 I wish I had a Samsung Galaxy tab 6 or 7 bye bye,
The only thing I don't get  for a children's app they sure do want a lot of information just to download it access to your pictures media files and stuff like that,
My son just turned 3 and has an easier time with app on tablet then on desktop. Love that we can take it with us and play together.,
"The games and activities are great, but the app has to many bugs. It constantly says ""no internet connection- go offline or retry."" It does this all the time now so that I can't even use it on my phone.",
3 mins into playing it freezes and asked to report it. It's extremely frustrating when ur paying for something that doesn't work properly.,
Too many buttons ppb the side that can't get hidden...my kid accidentally hits it and shuts it down...buttons on the left should be hidden in a game,
"I have two sons, my youngest is 14 months and my oldest is 4 1/2 years old. Hayden ( my oldest ) is unfortunately diagnosed with autism and had severe hearing problems as a baby. These two things together caused him major communication problems, namely being unable to speak more than four or five single words at the age of 4. ABC mouse along with therapy has really opened up a new world for him and over the last six months we have seen noticeable improvement!!! He loves  ABC mouse!!!  Mom & I do too!!!",
So does my 3yo. She has already tested at twce her age level in vocabulary and basic math PRIOR to buying this tool.,
I loved it so much for The kids and also for adults as well,
My mini loves to learn new things. With each exercise and new adventures she has an endless map of learning Only thing is I wish it didn't let them sign you out.,
My son is in second grade and with ABCmouse he starts to read more. We love this app. There is lot of things for him to learn about. Thank you ABCMOUSE,
"Specs say requires Android 4.0 and up.  My daughters tablet is 4.4.4 and I can't download the app because its not compatible?  I try to log her in through chrome and the only screen I get after logging in prompts me to download the app?!!  I'm very disappointed, she loved the app and I have a paid subscription.üòï",
He asks to play all the time. He loves getting the tickets at each level. I love how it gets progressively more challenging so he stays challenged.,
I was struggling with trying to teach my daughter to prep her for school. This made it much easier.,
He is learning lots and won't put down the ipad now. He is only two years old and loves educational programs. Thank you abcmouse.,
"I wish it taught phonics,  and didn't teach sight words.  Other than that,  my daughter loves it.",
"Love this app , my daughter is advanced in school and I belueve ABC mouse had alot to do with that",
My daughter totally love this app.  She is always on it learning new things and I can see the growth in her learning. I would recommend for all kids. üíûüíñüòç,
My 2 year old has learned so much and is so smart!!! Thanks to ABC mouse. We have tried and tried to teach him but ABC mouse really helped him learn to count to 10 all his colors and a good bit of animals.,
"I like the features a lot, but it still doesn't capture my child's full attention.",
The coloring pages won't work. My daughter colors them but when she hits done nothing happens and so she can not go to the next lesson.,
This is a great app that has help my daughter and son get a good boost in learning before they start school.,
I use this app on a tablet for my son and I am constantly finding that I have to close the app and restart it multiple times during a 15 minute time span. Very annoying.,
I love how your child gets to have some fun at the end by decorating there room my child when he does a lot of work we buy a new toy. You should really try this but I wish it had more grades for example if it went to 5th grade.,
"Way to expensive, for that I'll just enroll my kid with a tutor, cost the same amount.",
My 5yo is a videogame fanatic. Hard to get any educational game he likes. He loves this sites and has not gotten bored.,
My kids love it! They never want to stop playing and they've learned a lot. Couldn't be happier unless it was also free.,
When I took the program off my phone your company keep taking money out of my account. Now that my kids want it back I still don't like it.,
"My soon to be 3yrs old loves to learn with abcmouse. He thinks he is just playing, coloring and reading stories. He loves to see the animals and how interactive and fun it is. I would recommend it to anyone.",
Froze my Kindle Fire 3rd gen and then froze my Acer tablet. What's up with this app,
Can you please cancel my account I never could load it up we never got to use it not even once it didn't come in I don't know what I did wrong can you please cancel the account,
"We've got see ABC mouse for a few years but the last few months it's been non responsive a lot of times while all other apps are working fine, so it's not our device. Sadly canceling",
I was forced to remove the app from my child's tablet because it was causing the whole thing to freeze and wouldn't work. I still like the website on our home computer but the app needs work,
"My 5 year old loves it and she uses it any where from android device to ipad device and I know she's learning sounds and shapes, numbers and sings along. I got the year subscription on a Christmas promotion love it.",
"We love this app. There are times when the sound wont work or the game freezes, but it has gotten better with each update. Well worth it!",
These people suck. You have to jump through about a dozen screens to get your subscription cancelled as they try to throw every curveball at you to get you to hit the wrong button and stay a member.,
Only free for 30 days then $8 month charge after. False advertising.,
"I started my son on abcmouse when he was almost 3 years old, he is now 5. He never went to a formal preschool but with the help of abcmouse he is ready for kindergarten. He loves playing the games and I love how much playing them is teaching him.",
"My son loves ABC mouse, this is the only learning app I can get him to sit and learn with.",
"don't expect much in the way of customer service.   8 hours waiting on return call with 13 ahead of me for tech support.   It took five hours to move from 13 to 12.  The wait on general customer service had 201 callers ahead of me.   By the time I get to the top of that queuer,  kid will be too old to use abcmouse.",
Worked fine until the update. Please fix,
But my daughter got bored of it too fast. Maybe she is too little right now. She is 3.,
My daughter is only 10 months and she learns alot && loves all the activities on here .,
My Daughter loves abc mouse she ask all the time to play she is always singing and having fun and I love that she learns a long the way.,
What a great app!! They also use this app in our grade schools. My granddaughter has Learned so muchüòÅ  . Thank you for all your help not only in our classrooms but also in our homes.,
My son Bentley is very picky with educational apps. He can't put this game down.,
"Says its free but it really is not, my son also can't use this...says its 2-5 but my 2 year old gets confused with all the buttons",
"My 4 year old got out of bed 4 nights in a row and hid in the laundry room to play this! She'll tell me, ""I'm off to school mom!""grab her tablet and go for hours!",
My son is so excited to learn and play on this. Yes three and I already see him reading signs and telling me things I had no idea he would take in so quickly.,
This app is clearly designed for Apple products.,
My child only 3 years and reads some words thanks to abc mouse. He loves books and game activities that are included. Very handy app for when we are on the go. And great way to spend some one and one time with my son.,
"WATCH OUT PARENTS! They charged me for another year without my ok, and without even sending me any notification that this was going to happen. They are now being extremely unprofessional and unhelpful about getting me refunded.  I am a single mom who works two jobs.... thanks for screwing me this pay period ABC Mouse.",
Ummm the prizes are a little idk and I wished the animals went away if u don't take care of them lol,
This program has done wonders for my great niece and nephew who I got this for. Thank you so much for everything that you do for children,
I absolutely love the app. My only complaint and something that I think needs to be changed is that the children should not be able to switch users or logout. That is something that should need the parent password.,
I would give 5 stars but there are so many glitches when ever we are on. Also freezes sometimes. Great for teaching though when it doesn't have technical distractions.,
My kids really love abc mouse. They have been doing so good in school I am a proud parent. Thanks abc mouse.,
"My boys are ages 3 and 4 and love this app. I recommend it to their schools and my friends. In the few months we have used it, I have received  good  feedback  from my sons' teachers especially  the speech therapist.",
My daughter is 4.5 and we started using it when she turned 2 and shes grown so much.,
So far it's a good app.my son isn't quite as excited as I've read others are but I'm hoping that changes.,
Please create a parent version to help with the pathetic grammar in these reviews. Great app though. Keep up the good work.,
My 6 yr old was advanced enough to skip Kindergarte if we wanted her too. And it helped her little cousins. All 3 have benefited from this service. A+++++,
My 3 yr old has advanced so much in his vocabulary and word recognition it blows my mind,
It will not let me make my child's avatar. I'm stuck and cannot move on without doing it!,
I've taught several children over the years and this is confusing for the children. They put it down immediately!,
Great program for helping the kids learn. Glad they finally got an app that works for my Android.,
Works well on my phone and tablet. My 3 year old daughter can easily use this app for learning.,
My son is learning soooooo  much off this app. If your looking for an app. That helps your child prepare for school then this is it,
I love this app it is a great tool for my daughters educational needs and is just plain fun to have. I would recommend this app to everyone that I know that has young kids in school.,
"Hi my daugther is in kinder,the teacher called me last week to congratulate me beacuse my daughter got 208 points in her test readingggg the averege is 150,and that she inlist my daughter for the GT program,im soooo happy and felt really proud when the teacher called and everything thanks to abc mouse",
Me and my daughter sit together and work on her learning. Sometimes she learns on her own. She has had made so much progress!,
My son can't get enough of the books. They have definitely helped him learn his letters. He is two and count to ten and sing the ABC's.,
Toddler approved,
"I love abc mouse,  but the app keeps freezing and messing up",
"Every time he buys anything from the store, the items dissapear!",
I paid for it to work not for everything I click to be a white page this is useless it needs to be fixed ASAP I was really hoping to love it since it worked great on my son's iPad üëé,
Awesome app for young kids! Yes it costs money but my 2 yr old does just fine with it. Best learning app I've come across,
Activities are fun and educational. Easy for him to navigate through lessons on his own.,
"Of course things load slower on the 7"" that is understandable. But the books won't read like they do on my other devices.",
"Great educational program for kids. Fun, leveled, 100% interactive. Wonderful and worthwhile investment for your kids.",
I have to pull my child off this app after an hour. He loves it! He is learning and does not even realize it. Worth every penny for monthly subscription,
App says free.... But needs a credit card to proceed with any learning.. Disappointment.,
My daughters both 2 love it and I never notice the money missing from my account.,
This is perfect for when we are at home and i need to use my computer to work.,
I  don't know about the app yet but the website version doesn't work properly on my laptop and it is frustrating.,
It is good for my son but the only thing is that level seven is not working on the learning par,
My two year old loves playing this game and gets so excited about learning!! It makes me so happy!,
The app don't even work,
I've been trying to cancel this for a month because my kids hate it. No one is helping me! The directions to cancel aren't applying to me (I'm missing a manage button needed to cancel) and I can't get anyone to help. I'll never recommend this app to anyone. It shouldn't be this hard to cancel payment.,
App freezes and screen turns white in the middle of a lesson,
I only had app for 30 mins and you can't get by lesson 3 of painting....they need to fix this A.s.A.p if not waste of money and would not recommend,
"My son has been using ABC Mouse since he was about 3 or 4 (turning 6 in June), and now he reads on a 2nd-3rd grade level! It's awesome!",
App is good only problem is kids learn to memorize and rush through after doing the same game multiple times but not sure if anything can be fine about that.,
It has helped my son so much that everytime I tell him he can play  ABC Mouse he just gets super exited and I know that he has learned so much because he has went from level 1 to level 8 and that is the most magnificent learning game he has ever played.,
I just downloaded the app and paid for this description and now when I go to login it won't even let me log in a white screen just pops up it shows the little mouth and then the white screen pops up this is not cool my son loves the ABC Mouse commercials and so that's the only reason why I decided to get the app and for it not to work that's really upsetting,
My daughter is 2 and she gets bored with it. So going delete the app.,
Its ok. Freezes up sometimes and it's not my phone. Does it regardless of the device.,
My daughter loves learning on this app. She can navigate on her own.  Worth the price,
This is really helping my toddlers learn. I wish it had been around 5 years ago.,
This is great. My son is learning so much so fast that it's changed my life.,
Needs more curriculum without the songs and art paintings. Not so much problem solving with numbers or stories with multiple choices to see if the child is beginning to become comprehensive,
My daughter was very behind in school once I got this she knows all her shapes her numbers her colors... I love ABC mouse that helped her a lot. Proud mom!,
"my son loves it.  it helps him a lot with his letters, numbers, and other things.",
"I was very happy to find that Abc mouse now has an app. I am having issues with the ""I'm done"" button. My daughter is stuck on one coloring page.  It will not let us click the I am done button",
"I used it as part of curriculum while homeschooling my 1st grader, kindergartener and preschooler! They love it! They learn so much from abc mouse! I love it too. I can trust that they will be having fun and learning in a safe environment",
Disappointed I cannot install on my child's nabi after I already paid for the year,
Bullshit says its free when its not already pay for school why would want to pay for app false advertisement here!!!,
She has fun learning and wants to do it all the time. I see a big difference in her skills. I am very happy with this app.,
My children love this app. Almost everything from the site can be played on a tablet or phone.,
My son is excited to be learning new things every day.,
ABC Mouse is a wonderful app that keep kids entertained for hours.,
"And he is learning too. He loves his pet hampsters, and his fishes.",
"With technology taking our kids over, it's nice to know they are still learning good things",
Great program. But keeps freezing and just shuts off,
"This is one of the biggest reasons I bought a tablet, so my kids can play this game and I don't have to worry about them messing up the laptop",
"This app sucks. No locks, poor development, just a weak version that's needs to get current.",
Love the learning progressive games. My boys enjoy learning how to operate the app all on their own.,
My 3 year old grandson plays this every time he cames for a visit.,
The app is okay and their password recovery on the web and in the app is a failure,
"When your trying to get an app for your 2 yr old so she can actually learn something when it says it's free but u scroll down and see that it's really not, put it like this, don't advertise crap and say it's free when it's really not. SMDH.",
The new version of ABC Mouse really reinforces the k12 arts and science curriculum. Becomes a nice cohesive immersion learning. Pleased with the new content!!,
"Lots of different activities, shows development, big help. Our daughter seems ready for school! Definitely worth getting started at a young age.",
My daughter loves this! Not only is she learning she is having fun doing it!,
My child loved it so much she was on every day I never been happier for her,
Not cool must pay,
"Works well. I like that the information transfers between devices, so my girls can play wherever they are.",
This app is awesome it really helps my kids learn more and they are having so much fun learning,
This apo is so educational for preschoolers- this apo has really helped my daughter a whole lot its 5 stars all the way,
"Easy to learn for all children that needs help in learning skills in, before,  and after preschoolers",
My kid loves this. He's learning so much. It's incredible how comprehensive this program is for the price. Worth every penny.,
Thank you for making an app my children truly learn from and progresses thru! I love the mulit child feature to enable two children to learn on different levels and ability.,
"Great app, a little bit slow but still good.",
Love this!! This has helped my daughter learn everything she needed to start kindergarten.,
"My 5 year old loves this!  Great app, easy to use, and she is learning so much!",
"What gives? I have a Samsung tablet that is very old and a fairly new Lg tablet but for some reason on my newer LG tablet, it's not compatible? C'mon, get it together guys.",
My 3 year old loves getting the tickets and has so much fun learning!,
I can add my son and nephew on. Also seeing big changes,
Well worth the money! My kiddo loves this app and it has helped teach her so much!,
Love this my daughter has so much fun she forgets she's learning,
Awesome! Sometimes doesn't play when the kids want it to work...but don't know why,
My 2yr old  and 5yr old love it and they love learning new things üëçüòâ,
Lots of fun things to do. He just loves it.,
I love ABC Mouse about as much as my toddler. She uses ABC Mouse everyday and looks forward to it.,
"My son is only 2 and knows so many different colors and animals, I am amazed!!!",
Great games and positive reward system used. I have 3 that love to play and learn!,
My daughter has heart disease and before we start doing ABC mouse she was behind. But now she knows her ABC she can count to 30 she knows her shapes and colors and her animals and she is four years old thanks ABC mouse,
Awesome my 4 year old loves it. Its worth buying!,

"Im using a note 3 android system. When trying to do 1st grade classrrom activities.My daughter and i cant. it tells me device not supported by app.App also freezes doing the activities n games it allows us in. I'm paying for this n not happy that its telling me to use desktop or labtop.im not an apple user n wonder if their cell phones r having the same trouble, prob not seeing everything is centered around apple phnes now a days.",
but it will not load on my tablet. It'll let us choose what we want to do but then it'll stay on a white screen no matter what we choose. Please fix this or tell me a solution. Not worth the money if I can't access this on the go.,
"After the 12 month subscription was paid in full in Dec 2014, Jan 2016 they start pulling monthly payments. Can't access the program, can't get email for new password, and can't talk to customer service. So many apps out there are free and just as good and fun for my kids. Wasn't worth the money, especially since I can't get them to stop taking it.",
My main issue is that on my kids tablets the programs will literally turn off within about five minutes of interaction. It's getting annoying. Also some books take forever to load or don't even load.  These problems need to be fixed asap or I would like a refund. Thank you.,
I cancelled my membership way before the trial ended. They still charged me and said I never cancelled. I have now had to get a new bank card so they will stop charging me. Lots of better free apps out there. Actually I was going to rejoin when my daughter was a bit older but no way would I now. They would rather lose a customer than do the right thing and give me back my 7.95. Do yourself a favor and look for free preschool apps. They are crooks.,
Whenever she enters a lesson it comes up a blank white page in the app which makes me really sad because she really loves everything on the website and this is only her first day. She is so excited to do the lessons and play the games. Please fix this soon for an improved rating.,
My kids love playing and I've signed up monthly payments to keep but fixing to cancel if  not fixed. In the middle of playing it will close very annoying to them. If was not happening would give more stars but they are losing interest due to it doing this every few min. FYI this is happening on nabi tablets all three of them.,
"I've heard so much about this program from repeated ads.Don't believe the hype. My child was extremely bored ! The app continued to close.Constantly trying to get you to pay for different items.There are way too many exciting education sites and apps ...hated this ,very underwhelming !",
The idea of teaching with ABC mouse would be great if the app didn't lag. My 2 year old son thinks a frog is a pumpkin because the app moves to way too slow. Please fix this. I've installed extra memory to make sure it wasn't my phone. Please fix. Asap,
Wish i could give jennifer the supervisor on shift a lower rating.She was very rude when I called because of a billing problem. When asked to speak with a supervisor she wouldn't allow me too. U couldn't believe her. I was astounded on how she acted. Really need to get rid of her or refund ME. Reason of call was because my daughter Nabi wouldn't download the app in mommy mode. So we deleted the account so we thought and didnt think that we were still being charged because we never downloaded the app.,
"Program is excellent and child really enjoys it, however it is impossible to get through 10 minutes without the app crashing. Tried two tablets and Android phone with same results. Tech Support useless and says to close other apps as they are the cause. Child gets frustrated when it occurs. After the third attempt at finishing a matching game, another crash caused my child to throw the tablet across the room. Thank you all for really frustrating a child who is trying to learn. We are through.",
We have had this for a year & have loved it. But lately the app has been messing up. He will complete a lesson & it fails to give tickets or go to the next one. Just sits there doing nothing & if you go back to the path it shows the lesson was never done. Please fix!,
"My daughters both love this app! My oldest daughter is impatient and would get frustrated with me very easily when trying to work on letter/number recognition, etc. But, she has been playing ABC mouse for about three weeks and can already recognize all of her numbers and a lot of her letters. She has learned so much and even knows how to do larger puzzles now. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone!",
"The instructions are not short and direct for a child to even pay attention to. Instead of asking ""How many leaves are left over?"" the narrator asks ""Count the leaves that the caterpillar didn't eat, then choose the number that matches it."" Psychology 101, children have short attention spans and responds to short commands. They ARE able to understand explainations, but command wise, short and concise are the best. Aside from that, the numbers tab is right below the leaves and doesn't have enough space.",
It's not hard enough to much coloring and reading stories. My son is learning more from the free app toddler preschool well its not totally free but even just the free part has taught him way more. I took a special year price thinking it wouldn't begin till after my free trial well they charged me right away and when I canceled it shows I still have a year of service my son used this site maybe 3 days at most and I wrote to online support and every time I get a reply and click to open it I'm given 404 error,
once they charge your credit card you can't get a dime of your money back and they'll won't let you use app with out a credit card on file. kids lost interest with this app few months after buying it last year and wasn't aware they automatically charge your card every year. $60 down the drain,
"Our son absolutely loves ABCmouse! He asks to play it all the time and has learned so much. He is only 3 years old and he can count up to 20, and higher, he knows his whole alphabet and is learning to read. Between us teaching him and ABCmouse he will excel when he finally starts school! This app is definitely worth the small amount of money we pay every month to keep it going. With this kind of education I would be willing to pay more but I am grateful that it has such a small fee.",
"After seeing a commercial on TV for this, I decided that I would give it a try. I‚Äôve tried to get her in to preschool, but with long waiting lists I assumed this would be a suitable alternative. The game is slow and lags. The set up is too complicated for my daughter to navigate on her own. I did a month free trial, but may uninstall after it is up.",
This app needs an up grade on speed. Most of the images are slow my daughter can't do it because it takes awhile for the picture to come up and it confuses her so she gets very angry and throws the device. Cause me a cracked glass,
We are having trouble loading this app.  My learning path won't even load.  We have tryed on separate devices and that's not the problem.  I thought this was great and my daughter really enjoyed this but now its giving problems.  I hope this gets resolved or I will be forced to cancel my subscription.,
"The content seems generally well intended, but the overall UI is a bit too busy while the stability and performance of the app is not good. It's frustrating watching the kids get frustrated, and not sure we'll continue using.",
"I don't get how this app can work on a Tab 3 10.1"" but not on a Tab 4 7"".  What's going on here?  Am I missing something?  I just bought a newer tablet for his birthday and can't run an app that runs on a older tablet?  This doesn't make sense to me.  Please tell me I'm missing something or I need to update or change an operating system to make this work.  It's just dumb otherwise.  In sadder news it will work just fine on my note 3 which is maybe an inch smaller than the tab 4",
"My kid is no longer able to use the ""learning path"" because every time he clicks on the next item (that is supposed to be next) it says click here to go to your current lesson and will not allow him to play the one he's supposed to be on. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling with no fix. It's like this with all of our android tablets/phones. We've been using ABC mouse for over a year and a half with no issues. This needs to be fixed. As soon as he's able to play I will change my rating back.",
Really disappointed with the app. The settings are always under maintanance and the lag of the curser is quite annoying. Which is a shame since the program looks promising.,
"The Android version of this App is awful!!!  Luckily we have an IPad and it works fine on it.  Please fix the Android app, it freezes, crashes, my kids finish a puzzle or game and it freezes, therefore, they do not get their tickets. Or, when they click on a puzzle etc., a white screen pops up.  I pay $100 a year for this App, fix it or you lose my $!!!!!",
It's a great app. I use it with my 2 year old and 6 year old there not only learning there also having fun while learning.,
"Loved it when it worked, app doesn't work anymore when we try to do the activities. Paying for something that doesn't even work!! Fix problem and I will rate 5 stars.   Really now the sound doesn't work??                       Update again, also thank you for ignoring me. STILL paying for something that only works SOMETIMES. Great idea of the app but it needs to work if you are going to charge for it!",
It's ridiculous I have to Uninstall the app and reinstall multiple times I'm paying for my kids to use this and it rarely works,
I like the app and the desktop application. A lot of exercises and activities for kids till first grade. Price is bit on higher side.,
My daughter loves this app.  She has learned so much.  She seems to use it more on her tablet.,
"Keeps freezing up, and when you email customer support they don't respond. Cancelled the program and they tried to draft for another month. Thank God I have a wonderful bank.",
supposed to be a  amazing learning app.  I imagine it would be if it worked more often than  not.  and if when it did work it ran smoothly.  cannot even get the dang thing to work lately.,
There is a ton of fun learning games. I would like the option for offline use. My little one loves it and it is well worth the subscription.,
"Try using a laptop. No kids don't want to do schoolwork for fun they show interest in what you show interest in, I used this to teach my 2 year old how to navigate and use a laptop successfully, and when they get the hang of the site let them 'teach' you what they know to build 'their' interest. If you still think it's boring well remember it's not for you it's for the children who will probably play with a cardboard box more then the present inside if given the chance...",
My son loves this app but it takes a min to load everything and he doesn't have much of an attention span.,
I love the fact that my child has an advantage in academics with this app.....thank you so much to the makers of ABC Mouse,
I am highly upset that i spent 80 dollars on a subscription.i have samsung gt-p5210 tablet. I worked ok alittleslow but ok . Had to do a factory reset and now it tells me this is incompatible  with my device. Iwill be contacting customer service. This is unacceptable with how much money i have paid.,
"Little guy doesn't even know he's learning yet since he started playing he knows his alphabet, and knows how to count, and he lives pointing out all the primary colors all around us! Great app! Thank you!",
"Use a tablet, not a laptop.  Your child will still need your help,  so stay close.",
I liked it before but now that I factory reset my phone and tried to download the app again it will not allow me and I just paid it up for a year. I'm very upset because my phone is the only way my son logs in. Please fix!!!!!,
"Looks very fun and educational, I noticed it showed free app, but actually its just a month, and still will have to provide credit card info, so I'll have to decline at this point: '(",
My son loves playing the games and is learning so many cool things. No complaints,
"I have a Samsung galaxy tablet 3, after I mad3 the update the app said "" your device isn't compatible"" my kids loved but now they can use it and I can't afford to get q new tablet just for this app!",
The games really help my child learn when they work. Most of the time the games have a slow response or they don't work at all. If the glitches are fixed I would rate 5 stars.,
"Anytime I open the app it is constantly saying to Go Offline or Retry with every button push. Really annoying! I'm signed out and back in, that doesn't work. I have reinstalled the app and that doesn't work.",
I love this app for my kids they are learning some much from this app and I'm very happy with it and I paid for two years and I'm glad I did its Worth every dollar ‚ò∫üòâüòâüòäüòÄ,
Itsnot working on my lg v10 it was for about 2hrs then it started blinking malfunctioning just not working period,
My daughter loves this program. Its teaching her alot while she is having fun.,
"We got this on the tablet, paid for a year subscription, and then it stopped working. So disappointed. Both of my kids loved it. They don't have phones. They were allowed to use a family tablet. Why would you take that away and make it only for phones?",
"I just paid for a year's subscription and the app is not working at all! Downloaded it on the phone and the tablet and it's blank on both! We were really looking forward to using this app, but i have no choice but to cancel my subscription!",
"It would be 5 stars, but I hate that is doesn't retain login and password. My kids keep logging out and don't know how to get back in!!",
Kids love it almost as much as i like them too play it...but i cant put it on their tablet so they can have access to using it at their leisure it wont even let them play on website keeps saying must download app to continue please fix... any suggestions?,
My granddaughter loves this app. She plays it all the time and has got her 2 year old sister playing it.,
This is the most amazing thing a person can do for their child. Thank you abc mouse,
Keeps telling me to reload the page or check my connection.. My connection is perfectly fine.. This app is the worst I have ever used..,
"Hard to find actual educational games. Slow, lags, kids uninterested.",
"Latest update not compatible with Motorola Xoom?  It's been compatible until now.  Running Android 4.1, app states compatible with 4.0+",
My children love it they can't put it down. This has made learn fun for them.,
"Absolutely LOVE this app for the kiddos! Easy to use and fun. It never gets boring for them since you can bump them up to more challenging levels when needed. Most importantly,  yes, they are learning while playing games, puzzles, and listening to music. The creators did an excellent job on this! A+++",
My daughter has learned to recognize her lower case letters in one week! We love this program. She actually enjoys using it.,
My 5 year old loves the site & will play for hours. The app keeps crashing on her whenever she tries to open any of the games. please fix.,
This app is the absolute best learning app for children. My daughters vocabulary has improved in a major way.,
I loved this when my daughter used it years ago. She started to learn to read and became confident with it through this program. Getting my son into it soon as well. So excited. There is so much to do with this program and it advances with them. Love it.,
"My kids love it, but I have 5 kids. Why can u only add 3 profiles!? I'm paying for this and all my kids should be able to have a profile! This needs fixed or i will not be renewing.",
She'll take my phone and play ABCMouse and is excited to get tickets :),

I hated it its so stupid it doesn't even work,
"My 6 year old son is in kindergarten and loves this app. We just signed up thoygh, so I'll have to update after he's used it awhile.",
My kids love it. I have downloaded in my phone and their tablets. Very entertaining and educational,
She loves it even more now that I downloaded the mobile app version.,
I can really see a difference with my child's learning experience! She thinks of it more like a game than a way to educate herself!,
My 2 and 3 years old love this app. They are very entrainment and learn of different ways. Thanks for this app,
It's very educational and keeps her attention. She loves the songs and books and activities.,
"App not working... not loading past the letter B in opening sequence. Paid subscription, child not happy!",
There are a nice variety of games and activities which keep my son interested and he truly enjoys the in game rewards.,
Come on is for little kids there I know they're trying to learn this stuff for school and now you just want to pay it should be free not $7 $7 and $0.95 that's so that's just so rude I hope you guys are happy because now I'm going to tell everyone this app is the dumbest app I ever downloaded anyway you want to pay for a kid kids to learn its for their education and I hope you're happy cuz I'm telling the whole world that this is the stupidest app ever made I'll might as well just said I just might as well just put it on YouTube and see how you like them apples you piece of crap,
My 4 almost 5 year old loves ABC Mouse! We love doing activities together as well. Thank you for such a great product!,
"I am still in my 30 day free trial, but so everyone is fully aware Abc mouse is a purchased program. I chose this app because it is wonderful for my kids learning and allows me to choose where I feel they should be. They love playing the games and are learning so much from it. It allows me to interact with their learning outside of our homeschooling and I can track their progress. I can have one child work on the computer while the other is working on my phone. They LOVE it. Highly recommend this purchase!!",
"This has helped my youngest so much, such an awesome site. Thank you",
Learning made fun. Its like having a teacher at home. I absolutely love it,
Three Devices and it shuts down every time I try to log in,
Love the app and my 4 year old son cant seem to stop learning..... he so love his abc mouse.,
My twins love this! And i still can add my baby when he is older. At first it was laggy and horrible but lately its been amazing! Lets see how this new update works!,
App doesn't let my son play games,
Great App my 3 year old seems to like it except for she complains about it lagging one in a while,
For some reason on all of my tablts it reads not compatible with this version,
She was bored with it and was not at all helpful with her learning.,
Why doesn't it work though I put in all the email and password and no budge,
Very helpful. My sons been using this app since the age of 2. He's now 5.,
"We used to love this app, now nothing works! I can't click on anything, none of the games work. So frustrating, I feel so ripped off.",
"Thanks ABC mouse, now my brother can play other than the PC!",
My 2 yr old plays all the time and my oldest loves helping her!,
The sea horses don't eat.,
I love this site and all for my early learner who is only 11 months old..,

If says free it should be that way should not have hidden fees should say how much before you download it and waste your time might be a good application but not going to pay 8.00 a month,
My baby sister is good at this and she is only 1 years old,
"Educational basics with music, books, colors, set to an individuals effort",

"My son is 3 and has had his account for maybe 6 months. During his testing at school, he scored in the top 3 of his class when it came to letter recognition. That is thanks to the help of this wonderful app. His teachers are excited to begin trying out this app for their entire class. Tons of activities that keep a child's attention and help them learn, even without realizing it. I would HIGHLY recommend this app. Worth every penny to pay for the subscription.",
"BUT ..... It can't play the videos in the learning path. So he can't proceed. And the very same video works fine OUTSIDE the learning path, but not where he needs it. It just goes white and goes back to the previous screen.    Update, video problem fixed itself. Not sure if it was problem with the tablet or the app. Now we are having trouble with different lessons in the learning path freezing though.... Since we are paying customers its a little  annoying having problems keep piling up.",
"Love the idea for this and me and my son were excited we could finally play on my android phone, but it said it was free!! Not only do you have to pay, we couldn't even get the 30 day trial because we do not use credit cards. This is b.s. meant for rich snobs, this is an actual fun educational game it should be made available to everyoneüò°üò°üò°",
"Tried this app before it was Android compatible. My then 3 yr old didnt get how to use mouse on DESKTOP version. Today I installed via Amazon onto Kindle Fire 5th gen. Portions of it  are in beta, still a great app - in theory. The bad part.... it constantly force closes right in the middle of lessons. It frustrates us both. Installed on Tab 3 Lite - no issues. Not renewing this app.",
"My son (2.5 years) loves this program. It's nice to have on our tablet for easy access. So far the app works fine, but if I could make one change/request it would be requiring a password to log out. Considering this is geared towards very young children, it seems like quite an oversight. My son is constantly logging out just to see what the button does. Then he's upset when he can't play. PLEASE find a solution. I would absolutely give 5 stars if this weren't an issue.",
"Update: abc mouse has been updated to work on our phones and tablets for the full level 7 curriculum.                       My daughter loves abcmouse but we are no longer able to use the app for level 7 or 8. Unfortunately our laptop just broke, so we will have to cancel if its not fixed promptly.",
"Did hold my daughter's interest & I think because it didn't seamlessly phase from one learning group to the next.. Kept the yr subscription & watched it become her least favorite activity..  BEWARE of the charges.. called to cancel prior to the subscription ending, (Yes, you have to cancel the subscription even though you only signed up for 1 yr) they still charged my card then stated when I requested a refund that it is their ""policy"" to only allow a ""partial"" refund.. My CC company handled it from there!!",
"My son loves this app, his grandma got it so he could learn more than what I could teach. However, now when we log in the app it shows the main page and states ""click on the white board to continue on your current lesson"" when doing so it freezes on a white screen. When trying to click a different lesson the same thing happens. May I ask how to fix this?",
Every time my daughter plays it on her table. After about 5 min of play its shuts off. Please fix or I want my money back.,
It's a great product but I've had trouble with it working on all of my androids.i contact for help and get no replies. I hate that we spent money on this for it not to work.,
I would give it 5 if I didn't have to put in my email and password every time my daughter launches the app. Very inconvenient.,
My kids 4 and 2 years love the app. However I got the a Samsung kids galaxy 3 lite for Christmas and the app isn't compatible please fix this issue,
This is bull it says it's free than you have to sign up and pay money what a rip off if u want kids to learn it should be free hella rip off. Stupid.,
"the commercials make it seem so amazing! it is cute at first but it's the same lessons over and over, just different topics. my daughter was bored after awhile. I would catch her coloring, decorating her ""room or play with her pet more than anything. there needs to be a time restriction on these things.",
Its a great program but the app doesn't work. I paid for a year how am I going to use it now.,
App doesn't work properly on this device. It just gets stuck in a loop whenever the mouse or someone speaks.,
Best learning tool ever! My 3 year old has been using it since she was 1. She will be reading soon.,
It's good app but it freezes up from time to time and the mouse doesn't want to move right sometimes. It's very slow.,
"It'd be nice to use, if it didn't lag so bad. Why pay for something if it's not going to work",
"My daughter loves ABCmouse but trying to get it to run on an android tablet is a nightmare.  Out of 3 tablets, all of which run versions of android higher than what they claim is required, not a single one of the tablets we've tried are compatible with it.",
This app is not an app at all. Just an advertisement for their website. Would've given 0 stars if I could,
My 4 and 5 year old love this educational program and earning rewards when meeting goals. It keeps them occupied and engaged while learning. I highly recommend this system.,
Do NOT subscribe and pay for this site......The site itself is a wonderful learning tool but even if you mark do not renew without my knowledge (which I did) they will still charge your account without your knowledge....They overdrafted my checking account!,
I noticed tremendous progress in my 4year Old and his not in school yet.  Also very good for my kindergartener he got to be student of the month. üòâ,
"There is nothing free about this app. Usually free apps allow you to see one part of the function to see if you like it. When I downloaded this one it asks for email and pmt info to ""try it"". $7.95 /month REALLY? I'll stick with starfall.",
"My little 6 year old loves this app! He's so excited to get on this website and color, do puzzles, read, learn about the about different planets etc..",
My son is 5 and loves this app. His Nov Birthday keeps him outta school til next year but with this app he will be ahead of the game,
My daughter loves this app. so it makes her want to learn. I would recommend it to anyone with little learners.,
I would like to know how I can get it to download on their tablets.they like the app and they learn from it.I hope that I can download to the tablet.,
Continually drops the link even with full wifi signal and other programs have no issue. Makes my son sad.,
My son will volunteer to play this when given the opportunity to play on my phone or use the computer. He absolutely loves this app.,
It sucks it does not work for God knows reason I hated it,
I will not order anything online again that that automatically take out of your banking account!  I have tried for two days to cancel this account only to be getting no where! This is bullshit!,
"My son is not currently interested enough to make the monthly payment of 7.95, but cancelling was such a breeze i thought it was going to be stressful, and I t wasn't.  I will be back for sure when he is ready.",
"My son has been doing so much better since this program, thanks so much.",
My daughter loves to learn. It makes her want to learn more and more because she loves to win tickets.,
ABC mouse is the greatest learning tool for my 3 year old daughter. She looks forward to using it every day!!!,
Only thing is with new upgrade I can't get 1st grade stuff. I'm a full member. Please help!!!,
My son has learned so much from this,

This App is a great tool to use for fun learning passtime for my toddler,

Please make the app compatible for the Samsung Galaxy kids lite,
This app is amazing it help my little cousin to get her ready to go second grade,
Love this app but if u forget your password or user name its hard to get back in,
"Hate that its not free its gonna charge me 8 bucks for a ""free trial""  !! How do I deactivate my account so I'm not charged anymore!!!!!!!",
Would give it 5 stars if it had kids lock...,

"I downloaded this app on my computer a couple days ago but it kept crashing and stalling the whole computer. So I downloaded it on my Kindle and it was working great yesterday, but today its crashed multiple times. My 3 year old was so excited for this and it sucks that she cant even play through a game. If this isnt fixed, Ill have to cancel my subscription.",
"I got the two month discounted promotion to let my daughter try it. She didn't like it, so I'm trying to cancel but it won't let me. Keeps saying error and Customer Service connection doesn't work. Will not let me get on to cancel. Now I must cancel credit card in order to stop abc mouse from charging me again.",
Not a lot of content for toddlers. Needs more basic things for 2-3 year olds. Most of the time the app doesn't complete a process with out freezing or skipping parts. Needs a child lock to prevent toddlers from backing out of lessons when they hit a button by accident. Maybe we will try again later for possible upgrades,
"We were so excited to try this app, especially because my son can easily use the touchscreen on my phone as opposed to a mouse on the laptop, but the app is incredibly slow at best. Most of the time nothing loads and we stare at a white screen. Please fix.",
"I use this program with my niece everyday. she has started using it I have noticed a remarkable improvement in first speech. she was only two when we started this, and now she's 3 but every day he comes to me and asks to do her lessons. This program has got her really excited for learning",
"My 3yo daughter was diagnosed with neuroblastoma a month before her second birthday. She fell way behind during all of the treatment we have been doing for the last 18 months. Thanks to ABC Mouse she is now caught up , and surpassing other kids her age.",
"I've been with ABC Mouse for years. I just found out about the app 2 hours ago, totally amazed. First thing that pops up once I log in ""Do you like this app"" well no I do not. Every time our kids try to do their numbers, it goes to a blank screen. Please fix it!",
"Purchased one month, tried to cancel it and yet it continues to withdraw out of my account. I have emailed customer service multiple times without response. It's touch screen for the games are not very reactive, and it's really slow. My two year old was bored within an hour.",
"Thank you so much for putting quality learning activities for when my kids use the tablet, we can't afford a new computer after ours quit, I wanted to so badly get ABC mouse for them on the computer, but that will have to wait a while till I can afford a new one, but this is just great I think :)",
We haven't experienced any of the issues stated by other users. My 3 year old has been using the app for 6 weeks now and she is able to navigate the screens and progress through her path on her own. Very well made and perfect for eager young minds!,
The idea behind abc mouse is great. But using the app on a phone doesnt work to well. The functions r small. My girls have to press on what they want to do multiple times because the app doesnt respond or they cant press the buttons. My girls get frustrated. & i live outside of town where i dont always have internet on my phone & they cant use this app unless theres internet. It would b great if the app was fully functional offline. I suppose itd b better if we had a computer to use it on.,
Running the app on a samsung 2014 edition tablet 10.4 or something. Running the latest OS. The app has a lot of lag and makes my 3 year old frustrated. He can't play any of the games because of it. The songs play fine.           It does run fine on my wife's ipad and the content is great.,
"My girls, ages 5 and 20mths, love this app. My 5 yr old logs on whenever she does not have preschool and enjoys the material fully. Between puzzles, songs and activities, she has a good amount to cover and learn. We are just starting with our youngest and she is learning fast with the ease of use. Great prepping for big kid school!",
I am doing the 30 day trial and idk why they would even offer a free trial with intent to show a customer how great their product is. It just made me glad I haven't paid. It freezes up and gliches nonstop. Can this be fixed so that maybe it can actually educate.,
"ABCMouse could be better, if it had more restrictions on how the user progress.  Rather than being able to just switch to any activity, they should be prompted to complete exercises that will determine whether or not they move forward, based on their responses.  If they don't pass the exercise they continue on that particular exercise until they are able to provide correct responses to questions, and activities.",
"Would be nice if I could set it up where my son cannot use the back button to exit the app. It becomes aggravating to have to log in every time he does. I would give 5 stars if that were an option,  he loves to play the app. Please put a parental lock on there.",
There is no way to place items purchased buy child into thier room. Child was excited about decorating thier own room but you cannot do it in the app. App crashes all the time child gets frustrated fast. In the middle of activities it just closes up. This is not how this should work. I am not happy!,
"My son will literally TRY to throw a tantrum if he doesn't get to use the app. Lol He loves it, and if he loves it, I love it! He started learning immediately. The tickets they earn after completing an activity is a great reward for them also. He gets a kick out of those tickets. I am very pleased with this app. Hopefully it will continue to grow and improve.",
"Before this app, and when it was only for computer before its new update, my children and I loved it and recommended abc mouse to friends and family. When I added my 4yr old some of the games and lessons were too buggy, frustrating her, my son when he played, and myself. I feel unsatisfied so far. If everything worked properly we would love it again.",
"My 2 year old loved it until the new update came out. He loves doing the puzzles and before he could just click a piece and it would put it in the right spot for him but now you  to drag it to the EXACT spot in order for it to work. I will be canceling my subscription if this problem is not fixed. It was a great learning app for him, until now. If this problem gets fixed I will give it 5 stars.",
Both my girls loved the app before the update and now my 2 year old gets so mad at it because it no longer says bringing learning to life and refuses to use it unless it's on my husband's phone without the new update and my 5 year old deals with it always freezing she doesn't want to deal with it anymore,
My son didn't take an interest. When i tried to cancel there was a tedious form asking for information I didn't know like my member I'd number. When I tried to contact abc mouse i had to send a request form. Still waiting. Difficult with obstacles to cance. There are free apps that are just as good or better. Update: I was notified I would be charged the first month at a discounted price because the trail offer of the first month free is false advertising. I had the membership less than a week.,
"This is great on the computer but it's not well adapted for a phone. Everything you would see on the website is simply shrunk down for the app..so everything is incredibly small. My 3 yr old son has gotten really frustrated because he keeps accidentally logging out. I don't even know how, I thought the password had to be put in to do so.",
"My three years old daughter just started with ABC Mouse, and I have seen an improvement already. Its really helping her with her numbers, letters, colors, and etc. I just wish they could focus on speech problems maybe that can be an update later in the near future. There are a lot of kids that suffer with speech problems including my daughter. That would be a plus if they can update that, but I love the app I have no complaints.",
"This is a great app, it has a little bit of everything. Choosing the learning path allows a structured form of learning while the classroom allows for reinforcement on what was learned. I've had a couple of problems with the app freezing or not allowing my daughter to move forward on the path and the times I've written they never write back. Other than that, it's a good app for prek thru kindergarten. This is not intended for chilldren under 2 as it could delay their natural brain development.",
"Ever since I installed, the settings say it's undergoing maintenance and should be available shortly. Without changing the settings and allowing access to certain areas my daughter is unable to use the classroom and actually begin a curriculum. If it doesn't change soon I will be complaining and getting my money back",
"Worked GREAT on our laptop.  Installed on our tablets, and it's not as great. Super slow, seems like it glitches a lot. My dughter still likes it, but she loses interest fairly quickly due to the prolems.  Not so cool spending money on a yearly subscription, and not being able to fully enjoy what you're paying for. Wish it would get fixed.",
My kids didn't find it very user friendly or fun. I still paid for it for a year with hopes they would get used to it. Never happened. It's hard to navigate through with smaller children. The next year it auto-renewed even though I changed cards and they would not issue me a refund . I called the moment I saw it post to my account and they would still not refund it.  Customer service is horrible!! Not worth the money. I would recommend Starfall or other apps!,
"Excellent app for kids who need to be (plugged in). My kids love ABC mouse. They think they're playing games but they are actually building real skills and learning. Couldn't ask for more. They love that they earn tickets to decorate their rooms etc. Also teaches them to save their tickets for items they really want. As a single working dad of 2 young boys, I don't always have the time to sit and do workbooks with them. I turn the tablet on, sign them in and they off to learning and success.",
App isn't the most responsive. My son has to click on some things multiple times to get it to work. I know its not my tablet because all other apps work fine as far as responsiveness. Also just started crashing today. Please fix ASAP. This app is helping my child so much.,
"One day it works fine then crashes  after 10mins, next day can't get pass the home screen. Every area my son tries to get into just shows a white screen. This has been going on on both laptop and tablet. Tired of paying every 3 months for a program that almost all the time, goes cuput after a few mins of play. I've Uninstalled and installed more than I've liked. Nothing working.",
App stopped working got an error every time we tried to open it.  Tried re-installing it but it won't due to another error.  It's useless now. My grandaughter is crushed - she loved it!  I paid good money for the subscription and its junk now.  Hope it gets fixed.,
"If i could i wouldn't even give this one star! This app was not challenging enough for my 4 year old at all and didn't even hold his attention for more than 30minutes, but this is not my major issue. After about a week i was no longer able to log in. I kept getting the popup saying incorrect password. When i requested a password change which was supposed to be sent via email i never received it and this has gone on for a couple of weeks. So i was unable to cancel my account until i was billed again . Waste",
"She's made progress with her numbers, colors and shapes and is working on her ABCs. It's freaky hard to get her to pay attention to me when I teach her on my own but she's doing well with this",
"Dont get me wrong my children are learning from this app, but that's in between it freezing or kicking them off after crashing. I don't want to but will cancel my subscription if it is not fix to lessen my kids disapproval on the malfunction",
It allowed me to keep my son entertained and help him learn things but there's a few hiccups in the program one of my children can't go on any further on the lesson even though she's played the thing over and over and over it just won't move on. Also for the younger kids it's so easy for them to exit out or lose it somehow there's no way to lock the screen so that they can't click out of it so they're constantly moving the screen and losing the screen they get frustrated so I only gave it 4 stars,
"My daughter enjoys this very much and it does help alot, but the only thing we have trouble with is when my daughter tryes to go back to return to a subject ( doesn't matter which subject) the screen goes white and then we have to quit for the  rest of the day. Hope this can get fixed? otherwise we will need to get our money back.",
"We got tablets for the children just to use individually with this application. The first grade section has a pop up that let's you know it won't work on a tablet device. It tells you to use a laptop or desktop. Why do you make a application designed for most phones and then need the child to use a laptop or desktop to further advance on it? Waste of our money because we have 5 children who independently work on ABC mouse with their tablet but now will need to have them use our computer, which I don't have 5 of them.",
I like the content but there are too many glitches. My son was counting the leaves but some of them weren't shown so he wasn't getting it correct. Then the numbers went away so he couldn't give an answer he had to remember where he saw the numbers last...,
It's constantly crashing. Pretty much unplayable. Main reason we bought it was to use the app and it doesn't work. Please fix.,
Didn't keep his attention and was kind of difficult to navigate. As a parent I never really understood how it was interesting for him.,
I like the site so I was excited to get the app but it doesn't work. Tapping any of the lessons or activities loads a blank screen,
"I would give this app 5 stars had they given me the free trial like they said they would. I only accepted this a app so my son could try it out to see if it worked for him and then continue. But instead it charged me immediately and I don't get paid till Friday so it got me in a lot of trouble with my husband. Once I get a refund for this month I'm not going to give this app a 5 star rating, however with that being said within the first day of my son playing he really learned alot",
I'm already having trouble with the application it stays loading and crashing like crazy...going to uninstall it and cancel my membership. If it gave me trouble I can't imagine my 5 year old boy  he'll get frustrated with it.,
"My 6 year old son who has autism love this app. He's able to work the app easily, and it keep him relax and calm when he plays with it. so 2 Thumbs up for me thank you ABC MOUSE!",
"Until the lag is fixed, I'm not interested.... My son will be intent on the activities and some times it takes a few minutes to load to continue into the next screen. I believe my kids would both be better students if the pages loaded quicker.",
Stopped working and yet they are still charging me for this useless app. Can't find time to fix it but have plenty of time to constantly send out wanting more money for yearly membership. Was great but we are about to cancel or membership,
This is so frustrating that it won't work.  No help from ABC Mouse that would correct the problem. Installed and uninstalled  three times to no avail.,
Early Childhood complete education and I had this for my 3 y old who now is 7 and it help but not as much as I thought and it doesn't keep my other child now 4 interested like it did when he was 2. The more they changed it the less he likes it.This time I paid for a year and got billed for more and when I pointed out the issue they just said well you got more months. When before when that happen they address it and gave me my funds back plus a bonus for the inconvenience. Not nice!,
"The app was working perfectly in the beginning, but for the last two days it has not been working. It takes forever to load the menu and when it finally does, when you click the activity you want, nothing loads. This is very frustrating as I have paid for a full year and have not even had this app for two weeks. Please remedy this situation.",
The app let's me sign in then immediately after force closes. I'd like to be able to use this for trips with my kids especially because the website doesn't work well on the mobile browser even in desktop mode.,
User interface needs to be more kid friendly.  Seems to lack a lot of features one would think a paid service would have.  Not impressed.  Likely won't be renewing after my trial period ends..,
Sound stopped on my tablet in this app only and on my phone games aren't working now. Customer service still hasn't responded even though it's been almost a month since the app started messing up,
The app won't open. It comes to the intro screen and doesn't give the option to get to the home page. Not satisfied considering that this is a program that I'm paying for.,
My 1 and 2 year olds love to sing along and try the games. I feel like they learn so much from it.,
I wish i could give more than five stars. My son and daughter have been using abc mouse for 2 years now. And its so amazing the things they learn and how smart they have gotten. Thank you abc mouse.,
"When they charge $60, I expect the app to work! The first time opening, it allows me to sign in and then crashes. Every time after that it crashes immediately after showing the welcome screen. I cleared the app's data and tried a second time and the same thing happens. The abcmouse site worked fine for me using Chrome on Ubuntu and I would grudgingly give it four stars. I would describe it as similar to gcompris but with lots of (in my opinion) unnecessary eye-candy.",
I love the way the children can become so much better n this fun to learn thank you..god bless,
My son isn't really in to learning but on here he can't wait to go to the next activity. I love this app and fid the price well worth it.,
The only problem I see with the app is that is doesn't automatically go to the next lesson and being two years old they just want to press whatever instead of going into the next lesson. I sit with her anyways but it should just go to the NEXT lesson without having to pick it in the toddler section,
The app keeps freezing and shutting down functions on my phone. My son can't interact with it at all.,
The upgrade is horrible. It freezes and neither of my kids want to get on the app any longer. We are canceling. Good job ABC Mouse... way to listen to your customers.,
My 2 year old daughter. Loves everything and she is singing better and coloring better to...best thing I brought so far,
Will no let my 6 year old daughter past the hundred chart wall construction. I even tried on our pc. Please fix this.,
My kiddoe loves this site whether its at home on a desk top or on his Nabi! I also installed it on my phone for emergencies. He loves it and he is learning through play. Great learning site for early learning! Highly recommend this site it's worth the money.,
Please update or will unsubscribe. Increase quality and make more games not just bubble popping.,
My daughters teacher asked all parents to download it but it won't let me do anything everytime I click on classroom it says to go to the website,
My daughter loves this app. She has learned so much while having a wonderful time.,
"They are still billing me every month, when I canceled months ago have contacted customer service thru website customer service several times tried calling but could never get a person! It's a waste of money there isn't even any thing really stimulating on there for my kids. I am very disappointed I have also read a lot of reviews on a blog website where tons of parents are still getting billed for the membership even tho they canceled. SAVE UR MONEY! There are way better FREE websites and apps!",
My 4 yr old twins absolutely love this app ....we have it at home and now on my phone. The only problem is  their ability to share the phone while were out running errands ...,
Never works. For a paid subscription how dont you have funds to fix all these problems,
"doesn't even give the one month 'free' trial like it says it will, yet still asks for credit card info",
Takes a while to gain interests. a bit overwhelming for pre-k or a beginner.  A lot going on there. . But good  overall for the price.,
"Why are people complaining about trivial things?? Really, $8 a month is a great price for everything the app offers. My son was notoriously difficult to keep engaged in learning his letters, reading, etc. This app has changed all of that, he loves using it and goes straight for it-all of his own accord. I couldn't be more pleased, there are SO many different activities. You'll never buy another educational app for young children!",
If some reason the levels are not according to your chid learning level or for any reason. They will not return any if your money  even if u try to cancell the sane day,
"PLEASE TROUBLESHOOT AND UPDATE THIS APP!! My son is anxious to do his ""lessons"" but we Can not get past the log in screen on my tablet. Use to be able to log in with no problem now I enter my credentials and nothing happens...",
Can't load any activities. App has Been down for a while. It was broken a few months ago and still down. I will more than likely cancel this subscription,
"Both our 3 and 5 year Olds love this. I am content knowing they are learning while they are happy ""playing"".",
I'm disappointed because the app said free. Only to find out you only get a free month if you give them your email then they want you to pay a subscription very misleading I'm uninstalling.,
My 2 1/2 year old loves the app she plays it on her tablet and my phone no problems at all.  Been using it for about 6 months now.,
My 3 year old loves this app. She has been speaking for over 2 years and has a great grasp on numbers so far and I am seeing this app add to what she already has.,
"This is the biggest scam of a website ever. I signed up for the free trial and tried to cancel and was not able to. I have called, emailed, messaged and no one and ever responded! horrible customer service.",
Its the best thing they could have came up with.,
It's annoying,
"We absolutely LOVE this. however the APP doesn't work and customer support isn't listening when I say the app doesn't work. It isn't my password, or my 4 tablets, or my phone. The app isn't letting me log in",
Why it won't pop up or load on the screen is !taking me sick it just over and over keeps saying installed but it is not there ABC rat is more like it a waste no true customer service very difficult to even get startedüò§üòàüò¨üò¢üòØüòï,
My daughter is 2 but is in the 3 year old pre-k class. I got this so I could work with her at home. The problem I have is she can so easily exit off the app,
My daughter can't use this app freezes and buffers every other activity useless waste of money,
"With the update all we see is a white screen when my daughter tried to play her lessons for the day, very frustrating... Please fix ASAP because we really love it & she is learning all about her letters and numbers!",
It's great when it works but I spend more time trying and trying and no luck once in awyle it works fix please my daughter really loves it .,
"App keeps crashing when I launch it. Cleared the cache, reinstalled the app still no luck. I will have to cancel my subscription if this is not fixed asap.",
"Just downloaded, but my daughter can't play because after the opening  screen there's a blank yellow screen with the loading symbol in the middle and it never finishes loading. Good thing I didn't pay!",
This game is so stupid please fix I don't want to suffer this email crap and why this does this want money every month I can't pay for that kind of crap this thing is a piece of junk this is so stupid if you get rid of it I'll give 5 stars but right now I will give 1 star I hate it so much:‚Äô-(,
My 3 year old daughter enjoys learning on this app. My 7 year old son enjoys playing occasionally too to help his sister even though most of the curriculum he is already above now.     Samsung Galaxy S6,
I love how it helps my dauther learn so quick; and its just I treating to her. It's good that she is interesting in learning.,
The activities are OK but you have to sit with kids the whole time. Not kids friendly at all.,
"All 3 of my kids are on it. I wish there was more to do offline but when connected, they have a blast.",
My daughter is ahead of her class thanks to abc mouse. Saves me during delays in public transportation and I don't have to worry about content quality,
I have had an account since 2012  and cannot log into the app.  My students are highly upset.,
"Having problems with it freezing up. Please fix, it's annoying to pay for something that doesn't work properly.",
Very good app that engages my children and encourages them to learn more. They love playing and are learning at the same time. Hoping more grades will be added besides the first grade beta.,
The sign up button works just fine -- just not the log in button for current subscriptions.  Guess we'll have to stick to the computer.,
"It keeps freezing!!! My daughter is getting upset when this happens. I'm getting ready to pay for it and if this is what happens all the time I then don't think it worth it, never had any problems until today!!! Please fix ASAP, once it is back working I will then change my rating!",
Loved the app but will not load anymore. Will have to cancel subscription if this glitch isn't fixed asap.,
"Signed up for the trial and the moment the app logs in, it crashes.  Good thing it works to the point of collecting payment info first....",
Greatgrandaughter loves it. I just wish it was a little more toddler friendly.  A start page just for them would be great.,
It will not let me log in. I pay for an account yet I can not get on to it. Tells me I need to make another account.,
ABC MOUSE works well on my phone and never freezes. I assume it depends on the phone Co..and type of phone. My children learn great with this app. Thanks ABC MOUSE and I will continue with my subscription.,
"My 6,1 love it and the kids love to learn and my 9 year old daughter is not leaning good so we put her on it and she said she loves it we love are kids to learn",
Variety of all things children need to do well in school.,
"great for the phone or tablet,  fantastic on a computer.  this is a must for early learning and it's fun watching your kids progress and grow.",
My kids like playing on the computer but my 2 yr old has trouble using the mouse. He loves the app since his finger is his mouse.,
I like the app just doesn't hold my oldest attention very well,
"I had heard wonderful things about this program and was excited to try it with my son.  However, you cannot do anything at all on the app until you register and input credit card information!  It gives a month free but will them automatically begin charging your credit card if you do not cancel it.  I am not willing to take this risk with any app, so my son did not even get to try this at all.  Don't waste your time unless you plan to pay monthly for this app.",
Works great on the Web but the app crashes upon opening. Needs fixed can't tell a 4 year old the programmer can't do his job. 5 stars once working,
Was looking forward to having the app...but never loads just quits and that sucks. Please fix this problem!,
Back before it was an app my eldest daughter used abc mouse on the pc. Shes doing fantastic in school and a great start to learning played a big part in that. Now I use the app for my 2yo and she loves it. A little guidance from me and shes completing 3-6 lessons each day. I've even caught her playing it on her own.,
My 4 year so mad that it's not working .she love to play the games and the learning path.,
Bad website. Keeps freezing plus when u want to cancel it still charges you. I stopped using it three months ago and im still getting charged,
My 3year old son loves this app and so do i but recently the app has been acting up and doesn't work all the time leaving my son very frustrated because he does understand hope the kinks get worked out,
Its so amazing she love it and just always want to learn more and more every dayüíùüíñüíñüíñüëå,
"I love, love this program! My four year has been using this sporadically for the past year. As time progresses she grows more interested in playing the games and going through the lessons. This type of education material should be available and mandated at all early learning institutions!",
"As a kindergarten teacher, my students LOVE playing on ABC Mouse. They love earning tickets so they can purchase items for their own rooms. They have taken ownership and really work hard to achieve each goal. Thank you!",
"This app is crap, my son and i were  excited  to get it started but it kept on crashing, we havent had a chance to use it. I need some assistance unsubscribing please.",
"Only app that not only keeps their attention for more than two minutes, but they are learning as they play.",
My daughter loves it and she's learning new things every day which means I love it! I am so happy my husband and I decided to pay for a subscription.,
"My little one loves loves loves it. Not the greatest app on a smart phone because the screen is a little too small for all the functions, but it would be great on a tablet.",
"All I get is a blank yellow screen. I hear many good things about abc mouse, so it is truly disappointing not to have this app work.",
It crashes every now and then! Drives me insane when I have two tablets crashing at different times.,
He has always done so much better with tablets than computers so I'm glad there's an app now!,
"great when it worked.   hasn't  worked for months and its so very disappointing .  perfect learning tool for kids, my daughter  absolutely  loved it.",
First off it freezes if you don't press skip then it won't sign you in after putting the correct email and password.,
It does not let my kid play it.It's dumb don't get it,
The recent update has rendered this app useless. My child cannot open any of the activities. They simply do not load. Only a white screen appears. Why am I even paying for the membership if we can't even use it?,
"I have been trying to download the ABC songs on which every letter has a different song, but I haven't been able to do so, if I continue having difficulties I'll have to cancel my order.",
"My 3 year old grandson loves this. Never used to sit still for books or coloring. Now he can't wait to ""play school "".",
Have had program a small amount of time. But my grandson has really enjoyed and learned to coordinate  and accept  instructions.,
WARNING if you purchase a year they will put you on auto renew and charge you $60 at the end of your year. with out giving you reminder notice or chance to cancel before hand... My children lost interest after a month and barely used it. Not worth the money.,
My 3 and 5 year old niece and nephew play this on my phone and tablet all the time. We haven't had any issues.,
I thought it was amazing because my child has trouble paying attention so when I used this he didn't miss a word his teacher said,
"Cant change profile settings to cancel print. Kids want to change profiles and you cant access the options, quits in the middle of an activity and I have to log in again.....",
My 2 year old loves ABC mouse and he learning so much .. I would recommend it so worth it,
My kids absolutely love it.  Its fun and definitely helps them learn.  This is a great app and program to help your kids learn.,
Great learning application that your kids can grow with. My daughter looks forward to ABCmouse,
Best learning app ever..  my son plays for hrs and sshow me what he learns,
My kids love this and I also love it. They have a great time learning. They are doing great with what they've learned. They don't want to stop playing.,
My 3 yr old is able to do so much on this app alone! The only difference between the app and the actual website is that the app does not highlight while reading which is why I am not giving it a full 5 star rating. Everything else is wonderful!,
"It's so easy for him to use and really interactive, he looks forward to getting to use it",
Half of the activities won't load. Doesn't always explain what needs to be done with each activity.,
I had no problem before but now the app is always frozen I can't get past the loading screen. I have Uninstalled  and reinstalled  nothing. it just doesn't work anymore. please fix this issue.,
My son gets frustrated cause it freezes after while other wise its good,
"Works fine for about 10 minutes then it starts to slow down and becomes unusable then crashes....it does this on every Android device I've tried including a nexus 7, HTC desire 816, and a Kyocera hydro vibe...same story on all of them",
"My daughter has been loving this app since day one, we have never had a problem with any part of the app.",
Had to take daughter to er and abc mouse keeped her mind off the bad stuff and she was so proud when she read the story.,
Very new for us but my 3 year old is constantly asking to play it. As a parent so far I think it's great.,
"This set up is so wonderfully creative that my son doesn't even realize that he's learning! He'll pipe in to a conversation and when I ask how he knew that, he responds with ABC Mouse!! An all around wonderful tool!!",
Downloaded error loading during opening app. When it does open it will not go past sign in .,
Keeps freezing every time my daughter wants to play... disappointed,
They say that it's free and then expect pay for the application that is false advertising,
My daughter has used this for about two months. She loves the music and there is a lot to do! Great app,
"I was surprised to see that the app was free. Yeah, it's not free. You can only access the content if you subscribe to their website. Please be honest and upfront with your users.",
"This app isn't free. They give people a free month,  but wants you to pay for it right away.",
"This app works on every device and can be used on a pc. My child loves the songs and games, however the alphabet music videos do not play on the app, it says coming soon but it's been a year now, you guys could hurry up a bit",
We have this for our Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.  It works AMAZING! My kids love it. Thanks for a great app!,
Unexpectedly stops every time I try to open it.,
We started abcmouse for our four year old. It's excellent on the computer. I have doubts about the app.,
Really ticked off because I got the subscription specifically to use it on mobile devices. Worthless app!,
My 3 year old just absolutely loves it. She counts and says her letters all day long.,
It keeps restarting it won't stay open,
The app has a lot of potential and features. However many times the timer features are always under construction.  This has been that way for months. Fix the features!! My son is now locked out of different areas due to required password to enter.,
"My 3 year old is constantly asking if he can play his ""school game""",
"My 3 year old enjoys the app and uses it with ease, and I know she is learning when she does! Highly recommended.",
.,
I love that my daughter can use the app on my phone and i can work on my laptop. Works great.,
I couldn't find a better app. I'll encourage all parents to purchase this program.,
Boy was nWatch out for the terms. All the emails asking you to renew say to reauthorize and resubmit...IT AUTOMATICALLY DOES UNTIL YOU CANCEL. NO REFUNDS.,
Not tried yet.will see.,
"Its running slower and crashing way more the normal my kids are upset, having to redo activities.",
Doesn't load activities my daughter sits as long as an impatient 3yr old possibly can just to be disappointed,
Son loves learning through playing.  Wouldn't have it any other way!,
My girls love it.  There are so many different activities but they all tie in with a lesson plan so the kids don't get bored.,
Can't do anything without it crashing. Hope it gets fixed soon.,
I just downloaded this and gave all my credit card info and now cant even register it says parents name and nothing pops up I cant even put my name this needs to be fixed now this makes me not even want to try it out. Extremely horrible.,
"My son says homework is hard and he's in kindergarten, so this work so well.",
I have four children and all of  them ranging from 11 to 2 loves it and they learn even when you're not watching!!!,
My son loves it. It is the first thing that he wants to do when we get home from school or football practice.,
Love this app but it has not worked all summer. Please fix soon.,
Just downloaded this app my daughter loves it but now all of a sudden it doesn't let me sign in so she can play I keep getting a error message,
Yes you have to buy the subscription but my daughter loves it. Well worth getting.,
My daughter is about to turn 2 next month and she loves to play the games an to interact with the puppy we bought. She's learned a lot already an I'm looking forward to watching her learn and grow more!,
The app was great for when my kids needed it. But if you need help from customer service than you might as well forget it! The customer service is terrible and not helpful!,
"My 3 yr old plays this for 2 hrs a day by himself!  We sit and do the Learning path each day, then he explores on his own. It's a wonderful tool for early learning and it's affordable! . Good work",
"My kids did great with the website during our free trial. Our computers, however, were less coopertive. It's, obviously, nothing the site can do.  I only downloaded the app to cancel the account. It's a wonderful and very useful site and app",
My son gets frustrated when it freezes and glitches. You really need to fix that.,
"Keep closing or doesnt open at all,,,please fix asap,, my grandson loves this app",
Its just like the original but on my phone and I love that I can have more than one user logged in if using multiple devices. My kids have another reason to use my phone but progress and move ahead on their learning path!,
Wow i think ill be great at this but its 7.00$ so i think i cant have it,
The best I have a down syndrome Son and he love this and I love that he love it bc he learns so much from it.... Ty,
"It keeps freezing on my baby girl, fix the freezing and it would be great.",
I have 4 of my kids on abc mouse and it has taught them so much. I love this app so much.,
My kids like this game. Couldn't have found anything better.,
"Don't  waste your time or money, abc mouse UI is horrible, dont be fooled by the commercials, thier are many free app out thier like youtube kids much better then this garbage",
It's so good becus it works sooooooooooo well but some times wi-fi is not on,
"Not ""free"" except for first month plus you must agree to receive spam to get the free month.  Cost thereafter is UNCLEAR.  How about honest advertising?   App looks great on my granddaughter's iPad, but i wanted to use it on my Android tablet.",
This app is wonderful. It's never been so easy to get my kids wanting to learn.,
Yes I know app mess up however try with computer,
Shuts down as soon as I put user name and password in! Not cool bruh!!,
Excellent application for the recommended age group. My grandchildren are learning so much from this pleasant little program.,
This is a one month free trial that requires a credit card to activate. My daughter is so disappointed!,
My 4 year old son loves this. I love this great teaching tool. Totally recommend to everyone.,
"My 5 y/o daughter loves the books, games, and other learning activities.",
We are just happy that ABCmouse is a go to thing for our daughter.  She very much prefers the app to the computer :),
My daughter has learned so much from this program!!! I highly recommend this to any parent!,
The best thing I've ever Done for my babies,
My daughter loves the app but it keeps crashing. Please fix,
"I love the program on my laptop, but it completely sucks as a app. It doesn't let my sister do anything! Please fix it",
Will not give me the option to sign on.  I tried on 4 different  electronics,
My 2 grandchildren use this program every time they visit.  They love it.,
"Abc mouse they help  me  out  with  math,art,reading  and  writing  skills .",
The subjects and the topics are very easy to undrstand. My daughter loves it. I'll recommend it to every parent.,
OK I try too get every thing on and it says roooooooonnnngggggg I hate this app I mean I see it on TV and there all like oh my child learns so well with this app not me!!!!!!!!,
Teaches him without him realizing it. Really fun and educational.,
It wont let my child see their learning path,
"All the app can do is go right to error page. Tried restart, ram clear, and restart....accomplished nothing. Can't tell you how dissapointed I am. Uninstalling.",
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD  BE ABLE TO LEARN MORE  GAME DO MORE MATH PROBLEMS MORE READING IT'S NOT A ENOUGH FOR A PAYMENT EVERY MONTH,
Ever since the last update it isn't working properly.  Very disappointed...I just bought a years subscription.  Please fix ASAP!,
I will cancel if you can't fix bug that shuts down the books!,
I like how you can have each child doing activities at their own level of learning.,
It freezes and starts over during while playing,
My daughter becomes immersed with all the different activities and loves singing along.,
"I love she can play on my phone, ipad and computer.",
"Since we updated, this app crashes all the time, especially on the colouring lessons. This app unusable and disappointing !",
My 4 yr old loves this app. It keeps him entertained and he is learning so we love it!,
Doesnt work!!! It only let me get to the part where you input payment information but glitches when I try to make my profile.,
This thing is soooo stupid  this thing ask you every thing,
ABC mouse has really help my daughter a lot/ reading and wanting to learn more,
My daughter tried using this app. And she did not like it all she no interest in using this app besides they said I was going to have a free month of trial and they never gave it to me I automatically got charged then I went to cancel it and I still got charged two more months I do not recommend this app for anybody,
wont load doesnt work will be asking for refund,
How do I cancel my accout on the app Everytime I try it brings me up to the Internet page where I have to download the app but I already have it!!!!!!,
I hate it when I hook it up to my projecter it just freezes,
I'm paying my money..shouldn't have to wait until it wants to work.,
"My children LOVE ABC Mouse! They have learned so much, and had fun doing it. This is an absolute must have for families with young children!",
"Good product, but, does not consider children with disabilities, or children with autism",
Did not know they had a mobile app love it,
We love it! My 3 year old knows so much! She loves learning!,
App keeps forcing closed on startup.,
"Can't do anything with it now! Please fix, my child LOVES ABC Mouse!!!",
My kids have used abc mouse for 2 years now. Very educational and fun for them has really helped them prepare for school. I definitely recommend,
My 3 year old is now on her way to reading with help from this program! We love it!!,
Sound doesn't work on games or they just don't load at all.,
idk why but the update messed it all up :(,
Great and structured tool that actuality promotes learning rather than killing time.,
My son absolutely LOVES THIS! My daughter is enjoying the first grade content as well! So thank you Soooo very much for the additional content! I'm soon to become a lifetime member LOL!,
"I love this site, it is amazi g and totally wirth the little money that it costs.",
"It wont play the songs,my three year old is very disappointed. I tried changing the setting but it just says its being worked on??? I cleared all app data and still nothing. Can we get the app working again please!",
It's free only for 30days what a rip off,
I9 HATE IT PERIOD.,
This is the best app for toddlers.  Its so easy for my toddler to navigate.,
I cannot delete this account!  I've been continuously charged for months now.  I've wrote/called several times for help to delete the account and nothing! Will somebody please help me??,
My son is now obsessed with learning!,
"Lots of play- games, coloring,songs etc. Maybe I need to set my 3 year old on the next level. He already knew everything for their version of ""pre-k""  Also, app always logs out so I have to relogin once or twice a day so that he can play. It's ridiculous!!",
I did,
What a joke..... I feel like I'm being punked. The app is horrible. The app doesn't even start up. Blue error to load message pops up. Awesome job with this one.....NOT!!,
My niece was way behind and now shes one of the best in her class,
The ads never say anything about a monthly fee. Thay is crazy!! I can find something better for free!!,
This is helping my 4 year old that has a speech problem to talk clearer and understand words better!! Thank you!!,
Download the app for free to pay for a membership to use. Scam!,
Horrible!!!! Can't even create a parent profile let alone my child's.  Will not pay for an app i cannot use!!!! Freezes and when you pusha button it does the complete opposite of what you just pressed. Thanks for disappointing my kid.,
My son is a very visual learner. This program has been awesome at helping him.,
Great tool when I need to cook for 30-60 minutes,
Love it when working but crashes every time,
My son loves it. A huge variety of activities.,
Freezes will not work,
The learning path is not working PLEASE FIX,
NOTHING WORKS. CLICK THE ICONS AND IT GOES TO A WHITE SCREEN,

Lagging please fix.! My daughter loves this app when it's working right.!!!,
He enjoys it. Great way to learn before school starts.,
It won't let me log in to the app at all!!!! I would hate to have to cancel my subscription for this but I may not have a choice. I have the Galaxy Note 4. Is anyone else having this same problem with their Note 4?,
Keeps crashing. I'm paying $80 for this. How can he keep learning off this app if it doesn't work????????????? I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Still not working. What's going on developers???,
It not help my kid my kid is 6,
My son is above his peers because of ABC mouse and the school is thinking of skipping him ahead. Thanks ABC mouse!,
kids love it. nor compatible with older handmedown phones.Android4.4.2,
It's done wonders for my children.,
I thought the app was free?? I just literally downloaded it and it says 1 month free then $8 a month. That's very misleading.  Uninstalling,
My daughter loves it.  Worth the monthly member ship. App makes it better now,
My little is having fun learning.this app is great for me and my kids,
"My children love it, I love it and it's so much fun.",
Love and my kids are ages 2 and 4 and know how to work this. Thank you,
Boring it should go thru the alphabet when they touch the letter and continue with another letter not one letter at a time I would never  suggest this to anyone,
App doesn't work at all and I have a paid account i can't even cancel!,

Cant access on phone and tablet and customer service is no help. And i already paid for 1 yr,
Not compatible with my tablet. Are you kidding me!?? Completely wasted my money purchasing this program if I can't use it on a tablet. l'll be calling customer service about canceling.,

"I love this program, because my son adores it and it's really the only thing that can keep his attention, but the app won't do anything.  We can barely get past the intro screen and when we try to click on any of his lessons or free play or anything, it just stops and force closes itself.  Please fix.",
"It was great the first month, the second month it started giving lot's of problems it didn't speak anymore and it did not let my 4 year old daughter pass lesson 30 level 5 even though she completed all lessons it just did not give an option to continue. I am extremely disappointed with this app.",
"I decided to try ABCMouse on our Android tablet again this summer. Sadly, it is doing the same thing as last year. It worked for 10 minutes and then suddenly stopped. It won`t go past the start screen. Unistall/re-install did not fix the problem on our tablet.",
I wish the toddler time was a little more interactive because my toddler has a short attention span and will not sit still for the read to me sections and the songs. If the songs and read to me's were shorter I think she would be more receptive. Otherwise it is a great app and she really enjoys the puzzles...especially the planet puzzles.,
Not like it,
"We love abc mouse. My daughter, Journey, is 4 years old, and for the first time I see her get excited to learn. She actually wants to go to school and be in a classroom. She is thriving so much and I'm so thankful for this program",
"For a few days now, I've been unable to even get past the introductory screen, and the one time I did it wouldn't let me login. My son loves this app and is so disappointed we can't get it to work. Will be back to 5 stars when we can actually use it!",
As the title states I bought the year subscription for my daughter and the app force closes as soon as I try to open it. Not even enough time to log in. Now I have no way for her to learn when we are out away from the pc. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 3.,
"So glad you guys added a level 7 as my daughter was getting very board with level 5 and 6 as it was literally the same thing on both levels, but she seems to enjoy level 7 I just hope there's a level 8 when she completes this one. My only complaint and it's the reason I gave 3 stars is its always freezing up or it won't give her the option to hit the finish button even though she's completed it. Please fix this I hate seeing her get so upset because she wants to continue but can't, then I will give 5 stars.",
My kids absolutely love this app. Plus its easier for them to interact on my phone rather then my laptop. Because its not a touch screen.,
It would've been nice but it freezes up constantly. My daughter can't finish her activities because of this.,
"I'm so glad I got this for my three year old daughter. She was having trouble communicating and focusing but once she began this program she has blossomed.  She loves to learn now and she enjoys all the rewards she gets for completing her lessons. I'm so happy I got this for her, I wish I did it sooner.",
"Works when signing up. But if the child logs out or tries changing users, login text box will not respond. Making the app useless.",
I am having troubles with the time limits. I have taken them off the 2 children profile but it is still requesting that I add more time to the profiles. I have signed out and back in but it still request it. I have added more time onto my son's profile but when he goes to complete a sublesson it asks for more time. Please help me fix this! It happens on the app...I have not yet tried the website. My son loves this site but if it continues I might as well just cancel my subscription,
"Keeps saying off line no internet, but I checked our other apps and the internet connection great.....worked well before update",
My 4 year old loves this app. We have had a subscription for 2 yrs now. She can read and write and loves the challenges.,
I just downloaded it for my boys and it's not getting past the first screen. Sad that it's not working correctly.  Please fix quickly,
Apparently the app is not compatible with many tablets???? I NOW see many reviews to that effect... Wish i had looked before i paid for a whole year. Works fine on my phone but too small to be fun for a small kid. Hoping customer service comes back with something helpful but not hopeful based on other folks' reviews.: (,
You get the first month free but have to pay after that. That i don't have an issue with it is the fact they ask for credit card details stright up before even trilling the app. I haven't even tried the app itself not sure how secure.,
"Figures... Anything that heavily advertised on television is surely not going to give you anything for free! If you're going to let everyone have a free trial of the app before they decide whether they want to spend money on it, then just let everyone use the free month trial! Any developer that wants your credit card info before you try their app, I assure you is hoping that you'll forget about your free trial month after it's over, so that they can charge you before you've had a chance to cancel/decide!",
Tried to use this as a tool with my homeschooling. Was a hit and miss with my son then became just a bill during the summer. Oh well maybe we'll be back in September.,
Great app for kids but I don't think you should pay money for this stuff. It's unnecessary in my opinion.,
Love it on a tablet or phone better than computer.  Can't wait for glitches to be fixed.,
My kids love using ABC mouse but the app is soooo bad. Its very very glitchy. Too many tears over it not working right. Please fix this! Playing on a tablet is so much easier for their little fingers.,
"I would give 5 stars but the app won't load half the time on my tablet. My WiFi is strong but don't know why it won't load, please fix",
"ABC mouse itself is a great program  my kids love it,  but this app just crashed it won't allow me to go passed the main screen.  Please fix.  I'm running off samsung galaxy s4.",
I'll give 2 starts because the program seems to be good but I cant even drag to play and it log me off at all time. Very terrible!!! I was gonna pay the monthly payment for this app but I gonna go ahead and cancel it,
App has never worked in 5 months after countless updates. Abc mousr has truly been a waste of my money. App is worthless.,
My daughter love this app she's already reading and she's only 4. she has one more year to wait before kindergarten. She will be the smartest one in class.,
My 2 year old loves this app and always asks to play it. He is learning so much already at his young age. I recommend this app to parents who want their children to be ready for school.,
I have had this app before and it's wonderful just switching phones to add it to my new one my daughter loves beyond loves this app it's great when you're busy and you can't do learning time with your kid it really helps keep them on track,
"Our grandson looks forward to his ""tablet time"" with abc mouse. We are looking forward to trying out the new exercises. This program helps center his focus while learning.",
"The games are great and my kid who is 2.5yr old is constantly asking to play. My only complaint /suggestion is that the developers hide the softkeys from the bottom of the Google nexus, device.",
My children loves it my 2 year old grandson is enjoying it. He has learned alot from so has my 5 years old and etc.,
This will not go past the introduction screen. Why would I spend $8 and I can't even see what activities my 2 year old would be playing. Uninstalling now.,
"Haven't really used first time but I think it wil, be a great game",
Love it normally but my daughter cant access it from any of our tablets or phones for the last 2 weeks. Even on the laptop it is really slow and wont sync to her current lesson. Need this fixed ASAP!,
I have a android phone when my son try to play the games it goes to a page saying no sound and there is a loss of Internet.,
"I really enjoy this app for my child, its a great way to play and learn. I will say so far a few items have frozen making it difficult/ nearly impossible for him to finish a level. Please fix this problem!",
Is that my daughter updates her avatar but the picture of her on the side menu never updates to match it.,
Great tool for my toddler son & nephew to get them ready for school.,
"The cut out puzzles only work on the easiest settings. When I use the harder settings, the puzzle pieces do not drag smoothly. They get stuck and disappear so they can not finish the puzzles. Same for the coloring and connect the dots.",
This app is awesome! My children love to learn and this makes it more fun!,
Didn't like it much. Not to many things to do for 3 year old,
This app is one of the best learning apps there is. It really has improved my son's reading skills.,
It said first one free and this whas mi first time and it said I need to money$ so I ga e it one star one STAR,
"My 2 yr old daughter loves it and it is perfect for her homeschooling. The app works perfectly on my android box and cell. For those who tried to download it and it may not work, maybe try subscribing. The app is free, not the programming.",
At first my child was connected to the tv now he just loves abcmouse everyday asking to play.,
My 3 year old now recognizes his planets this is great. Now i don't have to pull out my lap top..,
Love this app !! My 5 year old is reading  and is so much more advanced  than other kids in her classroom,
"We've subscribed to the web for a few years. It's quite good and extensive. There's a curriculum to follow full of games, books, videos, puzzles and colouring. You can play freely as well. Reward system. Pets, hamster cage, and aquariums to customize and tend to. Toddler to grade 1.",
"Some activities drag, not open and stop mid stream.  Please fix as fustrates the students.",
"Fix it. I'm paying so it can crash over and over. Garbage. July 1st, 2015 still not fixed. Crashes Constantly.",
My kids are doing wonderful because of the site...now with this app we can take it everywhere.,
Its great but I wish it was an offline app cause I don't have a stable wifi signal,
"This ""app"" is a sign up for an internet-based subscription service. Can't even play 1 game without signing up for a free trial of 30 days access.",
It has helped my child and I also enjoy being able to also interact with her.,
"Love this on the laptop and ipad, but can't get past the intro screen on my phone. Would be 5 stars if it worked.",
"I have a three year old daughter and I love, love, LOVE this app. Her smile when she completes an exercise AND wins tickets is priceless. I love the fact that she's having fun AND learning. She loves ABC Mouse. She likes customizing her avatar and room with the tickets she earned. She likes the books, puzzles and songs. I adore this app so much!",
"Good idea, but the app is very buggy. It crashes every 5-10 minutes. It's so incredibly hard for my daughter to stay focused with it crashing so often.",
"My parents bought a subscription for the grandkids and so far my kid has not been able to do anything on the app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, sent an error report, and have rebooted my system. Nothing has helped the app work. Thoroughly frustrated.",
Can't get past follow the numbers drawing task. frustrating because cannot continue lessons. How can we get past that?,
Learning made easy for your little ones to get a jump start on life. This App is amazing.,
My three year old has learned a lot in a short amount of time,
That was all I had to say,
Stuck on a story. Can't move forward,
I had purchased this program and the results were both noticeable and beneficial. I would highly recommend this program.,
A little glitchy and clunky at times. Otherwise nice for a toddler,
My little sis has a habit of playing my games without asking me. So I gave her  her own game. Problem solved       :-D :-) :-),
Great for learning for the kids . it keeps there attention  and helps them learn and have fun to .,
How do i cancel so i dont get billed,
"My son just turned two two months ago, and this has done wonders for him. He already recognizes all the letters in his name and can read mom and dad!",
Some games are glitchy!but still awsome for my little sister that is only 1,
"I will be asking for a refund. We continue to be booted off the app, we have to log in again and every time we try it at it happens again. Very disappointed!!",
It won't work on rooted devices.,
My mom and dad were going to hold my little sister  back and they still are she's in kindergarten but I saw this on TV and  after a week of her on this she knew her alphabet  and how to count to 30,
Works great to keep them up to speed during these summer months!!,
Do not sign up it is impossible to cancel it is a ripple off,
Should make it more difficult to log out,
My 2 1/2 yr old son just loves it. Especially the games. He's learning a lot from it.,
Can't switch users,
"Great app, both my girls age 1 and 5 love abc mouse.",
I'm getting this for my three year old sister I hope it's good,
My son loves it! The rewards encourage him and he feels proud when he gets one,
Like it for my grandma baby's,
"Helpful. I didn't, the games are kind of confusing.",
This is our go to app for my 4 year old. He loves it.,
Amazing program. In two days f two hours a day I noticed my son could recognize a few  letters and numbers.,
I love it really help my child to learn,
My daughter loves it but the stuff thts on it is too hard,
A good start for the little ones,
My 16month old now knows red and blue,
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FREE ONLINE LEARNING ACADEMY,
My 3 or love this app its a little slow at times but she loves to learn with abc mouse,
all you do is play with pets like hamsters and no learning I LOVE HAMSTERS!!! And the commercials on the TV are fake ONLY DOWNLOAD IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH HAMSTERS!!!!!üê≠üê≠üê≠üê≠üêÅüêÅüêÅüêÅüêÄüêÄüêÄüêÄmy sister plays it and all she does is play with hamsters,

"We are having difficulty getting the app to work correctly on our Google Nexus tablet. for some reason it will not allow us to start the lessons from the app. we are able to click on other items in the app, just not the lessons. it works just fine from the laptop but the tablet works best for my 4 year old son. otherwise this program is great and my son enjoys it. please try to fix it so it works from a tablet.",
I don't know what's going on ABCmouse used to work perfectly on my tablet for my daughter but now it keeps freezing. I have had to contact customer support more than a few times to resolve the issue and I'm starting to get very annoyed at that I'm paying for a service that doesn't work. in fact the last customer service representative just told me to use a different browser however we use the app. I don't want my daughter to use a net because We use the app in child mode on my tablet. starting to get very frustrated if things don't resolve soon I'm probably going to have to cancel.,
I have 2 boys 6years old and 2 years old. Downloaded the app on a LG G3 Pad and Samsung Galaxy Note4 and its works perfectly fine on the LG G3 pad but on my cell phone nothing works. In the classroom you can't start the learning lessons. When you push on it nothing happens. I did get a free trail but I've been paying for it for about 4 months now. Would be great if they can find the problem AND FIX please.,
"This app has many issues on android devices.  It constantly says that it is not connecting to WiFi so work offline. Other reviews have said the same thing.  Also,  many of the button interfaces do not respond,  for example bringing up the puzzles for the farm animals.  These issues do not happen on our iPad. If this was an iPad app in would give it 4 stars.",
The app needs a lot of work and so dose the website the computer work awful. Pls make some improvements if you going to make up pay. Little disappointed,
"My daughter cannot use the mobile app anymore. Every time we try to continue her lessons, nothing happens when we press them. Some of the programs were glitchy before but now nothing is working. I've tried reinstalling but it's still not working...",
I have a galaxy s5 . It constantly tells me no Internet connection. And now it won't let my son click on his activities. I complained about it several times. I'm  thinking about cancelling my subscription but trying to wait it out to see if they will fix it since my son loves this app,
"Herein lies a huge problem for Android developers compared to iOS. This app could be great and probably works perfectly on several devices. Which ones are probably a crap shoot. Too many devices and too many experiences to manage. On my device, it says it can't connect and asks if I'd like to retry or go offline. This ruins the experience. When I try to switch accounts, I can't switch to the right most account. Too many bugs for me. I wish all involved luck.",
"I created the account, set up my payment plan, and then go to actually play the app with my daughter and it freezes completely. It won't let me play or skip the intro video and just freezes on that screen EVERY time I try. This is very frustrating considering that you are PAYING a monthly subscription and you can't even bypass the app and just go to the website, cause the website makes you download the app if you are on a phone or tablet. This is VERY unprofessional and needs to be fixed!!!",
"I have 3 kids and they love it, but they all want to play at the same time.  It works great on the computer, but is always offline on the mobile devices which is what we have with us 100% of the time.  If this gets fixed, then I would change my rating, but until it is, I am extremely dissatisfied.",
"They never stop asking to play, and i dont mind at all because they are learning... highly recommended if you are one of the good parents who want them to learn and have fun rather than be zombies in front of the boob tube(t.v.)!! and for the creators, a little cheaper and it would be WAY more realistic/worth a purchase for low income families üòâ like 40 a year..",
"My daughter hates practicing her letters and numbers, and we've spent hundreds on innotab and mobigo games but  she loses interest fast or doesn't want to play at all....but we signed up for ABC MOUSE today and she is already done with 7 whole lessons!!! She loves it, and I love that she's finally interested in learning!",
"I was so excited to try this app with my daughter. but after loading the apps, she could not even play the games. A screen kept popping up saying no connection. I have  WiFi for everything else . but this never worked!!!!",
"Lots of issues on nexus 7. Unresponsive, crashes, games that just don't work, etc. Had to give my daughter the iPad, it works perfectly there. This is a good example why android user experience is still far behind Apple. Edit: Works much better agree downgrading the tablet to KitKat. Lollipop needs fixing though.",
My daughter loves this app everyday she's asking for ABC mouse. She is really learning a lot of great things and I'm very happy I ordered this for her. I just can't wait until everything on the app is up and running.,
My son enjoys the game but I can't believe every screen change requires you to reconnect. I'll be canceling my subscription. Pretty sad that a company that charges monthly can't produce a working product even on a stock N5,
8 I am having lots of problems logging in. I got this program specailly for my grandson. Here we are summer break  and we can't use it and I have no phone number to even call for some answers. Hope no one else gets taken.,
"I used to love it, but have been having nothing but issues. May cancel becuz my daughter keeps getting kicked out of the app. Apparently I'm not the only one having this issue. Obviously they arn't fixing it. Also their ""customer service"" is crap too.",
My daughter loves this. But I either have to give her my phone or my elipsis 8. Because it is not compatible with her elipsis 7 please fix this.,
I'm not sure what is wrong but all of a sudden the app will not open at all. Get the bugs fixed my kiddo loves this app,
"When I first downloaded this app it was excellent! Perfect! Fantastic! But now every time my son plays it, there's that message. PLEASE FIX VERY ANNOYING. And I've Uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Don't know what you changed but please FIX IT. thank you",
"1st tried to sign up for a free trial, I couldn't figure out how to do that without putting my paypal in so I paid for a year it wasn't very effective on my laptop. my son can't use a mouse so I put it on my phone & it's hard to see since it's so small. Ibuy a tablet reading the requirements for it & bought a tablet accordingly. it says it works w/ all Android it doesn't. I write customer serv they sent me a list of mn req when I replied that I had them they sent me instructions on how to cancel.",
Very cool. Both my 7yo and 4yo find things on here that are relevant to their own development. Worth the money for the year just to stimulate their minds and very them asking questions.,
Very displeased with the service. Why should I pay 4 payments of 19.95 when I can't even watch the start video on my phone. Very very unhappy. I have a Note 3 & I'm not happy.,
My daughter loves this app and she is in kindergarten!! She was struggling at school a little with her math so we decided to download this app for her and pay the subscription fee (don't be cheap on your child's education parents). This is a million times better then any toy you can purchase for them because they really learn and enjoy doing so as well. Needless to say my daughter got promoted to 1st grade already! Yay!,
I have this installed on two different devices including my galaxy s5. It has so many issues. Customer service is very rude and continues to not help.  Stop spending so much money on commercials and fix your issues.,
"My son has learned so much from the games. Its amazing. All his colors, counting, animals its just great.",
"I had an account already when I first signed up on computer. My kids love the abc mouse game, but when I downloaded it on my s5 at first it worked perfectly, now it's unresponsive. That doesn't make sense to me. Why have it for download if not going to work. Fix like now, this is inconvenient, seriously!!!",
The app constantly freezes in one of the activities. Please revise in order to give it 5 stars.,
"the lessons do not respond to our touch on my HTC m8. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and no change... It worked just fine before update. I will not pay for this any longer.... Thats a shamed, my son really loved it",
My daughter is sad she can't feed her pet hamster.   We have Samsung Galaxy 5.  If every link functioned she would give it 5 stars.,
"Will someone PLEASE tell me how to cancel my membership?  I have tried to find an email,  phone #... anything... I have a house full of 2 and 3 year olds and absolutely NONE of them enjoyed this app :( And on top of that, it constantly freezes, and is SUPER laggy! Very disappointed. Need help in terminating my membership!!!",
Now it just freezes on my android tablet nobis and it doesn't work at all for my Samsung tablet please fix or give me my money back,
My child cannot move on in lessons because the program won't respond. I had to pay for this so I expect it to fixed.,
Love abcmouse just wish it had more. My kids are almost done and I'm so sad to see it go.,
I have tried logging on too the app it keeps telling me that my email or password is incorrect. I have changed the password already it's still not working not very happy. I have also tried downloading onto my nook tablet and is not compatible which it should be able to play on any table or phone.,
"I have a daughter with a speech impediment who is 5 and a son who is 2. And it works perfectly for them. The phone apps are the best especially on the go because theres soooo many different things for them to do, so it keeps them entertained. Deff worth the money!!",
I can't even get to the start up video. It will not load. I am very displeased!  Funny how I can download the app to my phone with no problem. Now I'm trying to cancel my subscription and can't because I can't get into the account. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!,
"My son loves this. He plays on this as often as possible. He is 4, and I doing kindergarten stuff now, and getting ready to start 1st grade activities",
"Sweet awesome, very informative and teachable. My girls love it. Portable app let's them learn while we eat.",
"The app doesn't seem to respond on my galaxy s5 or on my son's tablet. I can't figure out how to get his lessons started or just how to get him to be able to play anything in general, I don't know if it's because of the nonrespons from the app or if it's because we're on the free trial period, or what but I'm not a fan and I'm definitely not shelling out money every month for an app that only works sometimes.",
No music will not play any sound other than the intro and my child does the activities and doesn't receive any tickets and is unable to complete lessons,
"I love the features, the class room environments, the abilty to track progress and most of all it's fun interaction",
This app is great! My daughter gets so excited when she sees me log in. She LOVES learning now.,
When I first downloaded the app a few months ago it worked great. I am guessing something may have been done during an update because I cannot open any of the lessons anymore and other things aren't working as well. Very disappointing. Please fix.,
For the past few days my daughter can't even finish her lesson because it doesn't work. She can't play any of the games and the puzzles when she's finished its supposed to go to the ticket screen and it doesn't so it won't mark it as done so she can move on please fix,
Heard a lot about this so downloaded and paid and now can't get past the Getting Started video that is strongly recommended. I own a Samsung Tablet. Getting very upset! Contact customer service and says 24-48 hours for response. NOT HAPPY!,
"Not sure what's going on. It was working just fine, but for the past week its been freezing and not responding.",
I use this on my computer and just installed on my tablet. It will not accept my login and acts like I need to create a new account.,
This would be great. It doesn't respond so my son can't do half the activities. Very disappointing especially since you pay for subscription. The plan is to cancel.,
"Samsung galaxy tablet, the highlighted reading section doesn't highlight and some of the games don't let you tap to complete the objective (popping bubbles and puzzle pieces dissappear).",
My 2 1/2 year old loves this app. Hes always asking to play his game. Its kinda buggy though. I have had to delete it and redownload it many times.,
Using a Samsung tablet. The app is unresponsive and will not allow me to start a lesson.   Very frustrating,
My child is very interested in this app & enjoys playing it... I would like to see more painting by addition as well as subtraction since I've only found one picture in the app,
"Great learning experience for my daughter, she loves it so much that she asks me to play abcmouse game.",
It gets really annoying having to sign in over and over again. It happens in the middle of her games.....an unhappy child is an unhappy mommy.,
"My kids enjoy staying on while learning & I love it as well. My daughter is 6, and it's summer time perfect time to keep her busy and refreshed with what she learned. My son is 4, and excited to learn. As for myself I am just excited they like it. Staying busy learning is always a plus üòä",
Stopped working immediately upon expiration of trial period.  Customer support is unresponsive.  Poor quality product.,
So I have tried this app on my phone a note 4 and then also on two galaxy tablets a tab 3 and Anda tab 4. It won't let me log in using a Gmail email address. I have contacted customer support and they were less than helpful.,
"Other than my first time logging in,  I can't even get past the start up screen",
"My girls used to love this app! It was great! After the update, all it does is say 'connection unavailable'  which, there is zero problems with my connection, now it lags, and also forces stop. FIX THIS PLEASE! I didn't pay almost $100 of a membership so I can't use it.",
Good luck canceling ever! I canceled 2 months ago and am still getting charged which resulted in an overdraft fee and they won't return my phone call or my emails.,
"It has a membership cost, but that allows access to the program on your phone, tablet, and computer. It is also very well put together not just thrown together like some of the other learning apps.",
My daughter is doing the 7 year old course. Some of the tasks she completes but they get stuck and never show complete so she is unable to complete the level. FIX PLEASE,
"Worked great on my nexus tab prior to lollipop, now no lessons can be clicked, it shows them but when touched nothing happens. Please fix.",
Our 3 year old has used this app for a year now. It is a strong and balanced app that is safe for kids. Great job. I would like to find more like it.,
Finally!,
I really like the site but this app stops working when it comes to a tablet or the phones. I paid for this so. My 3 year old can learn an it stoped working. Plz fix this since I paid 60 dollars for this,
Great Guide for helping your under - 5 year old to reach their learning an literacy milestones. You have a first hand view on what areas they excel and where they need extra support or practice.,
Havent tried the app yet. But we love the website. So many aspects to it. Children enjoy learning üòä,
I love the features but I wish it worked better,
"My kids love this app! I do to, my 4 year old is learning so much.",
It no longer is available on my child's LG G-pad tablet.,
I can't even log in anymore I have been talking back and forth with email and still haven't gotten any were and I'm paid up for cup Lemoore months,
"Stuck on lesson 16 #2 #3 w won't load anymore so they Can be completed.seems most stuff won't load if you goto the coloring section in activities then you can't click sort tabs, change pages or even select a picture to color",
I cannot get this app to load on my Sgs4. Would be nice if I could get a refund of some sort! This is robbery.,
"ABC Mouse is a wonderful site and my son loves it but the android app needs a lot of work. The IOS app just works but the android app keeps going offline and the lesson activities are not responding. Developers, please fix!!!!",
Music won't play when my child is trying to do her lesson!,
LG g3 it keeps saying I went off line every few secondswhen I haven't.  Please fix.,
"My kids ages 3 and 4 love this app and web site! They have learned so much, things that i have never thought to teach them!",
I hate that you have to download the app to cancel it.,
When it allows my son to play I have no complaints. It has the potential to be awesome! But it keeps telling me I'm offline every few seconds. I know it's not my internet connection so please fix.,
"I never signed up for this account. I have 189 mb available and this 35 mb app keeps saying insufficient storage. I have to download the app to cancel my subscription. Didn't sign up for it, and I can't cancel it. Thieves!!",
Well I have triplets and today when my daughter got on to play its not working. Which has upset her!,
Slow to respond. Keeps saying lost internet connection while connected.,
Str8 whack app! You know i pay for my kid to play this and learn. Instead i get a frustraded upset kid! Not cool you koooks! I want my money back!!!!!,
Will not refund auto renew. This app is for 2-3 years olds. Not up to age 6.,
I have tried everything I know and it will not log me in. I cannot use it. I will stick to the computer.,
Like ALL the time.,
I just set up my account but it will not accept my email and password says it is incorrect when it is clearly correct.,
It works well for my son and he is so ahead of his class it's almost unbelievable.,
No longer works! Users can not select any lessons. Incompatible with latest Android System Webview update. Customer support is very weak.,
This site ducks  I signed up for my grandson and it downloaded fine but I can't get it to do anything  I can't even watch the getting started video  I have tried everything to no avail  and there is no place to get any help,
Not functional. Does not work with galaxy note 4 at all,
I have asked multiple times via email (because there is no phone number) to quit my subscription and they won't.,
I am so happy to have this on my phone and laptop for my son! He really enjoys learning with ABC Mouse. I can see a definite improvement in his knowledge and confidence.,
You Should not make your children do this just let them learn in school!!!! Let your children have actual fun!,
I have my son and daughter on ABC mouse and its helped them a lot.,
This must not be compatible with Samsung tablets because it won't let me log in. Customer service reset my password but that didn't help either.  Please help! my membership is being wasted if my son can't use it!,
"My son has liked this app then all of a sudden it stopped working, the activities are not starting. I have a note 3 and just updated the app today so it should be running on the latest software. MAKE IT WORK!!!!!!!",
I can't even cancel or request support. I never rate apps but this one I just had to say it sucks!!!!!! Fix it,
My little one loves the app but it keeps asking me to work offline. I'm not understanding why.,
Occupies my daughters for hours. As long as she's quiet and learning I'm good.,
Many activities get stuck in the middle of the child trying to complete it and its very exasperating for the child to have to start over again and again.  They need to make improvements,
"This app does not work at all on my samsung galaxy s3, as soon as its loaded to the activity page it stops and the only option is to close the app and try again only to have it happen again, Needless to say we are very disappointed!!",
"I really loved this game for my son but now it has seemed to stop responding when you try to click on activities, it never used. To do this and I really hope it gets fixed. My son is prettyupset about it",
"LG G2 says its offline even though my connection is fine. I would do 5 stars if it works all the time. I mean, I am paying so my daughter can use this. Please fix!",
I have been trying to cancel it for a while since all it has done is make my little girl cry every time she uses it getting her frustrated! ! I follow the directions to cancel it thru the phone and it won't let me. I will keep trying to look for a number to call them. Never again will I sign up to this!!!,
"My daughter is 5 years old and truly enjoys this app and the full learning experience that comes with it.  She ""plays"" on it every single day.  She is motivated to continue on the learning path by collecting tickets which allow her to buy prizes and pets.  Keeps her interested and learning.  Great job!",
Sucks,
My daughter is 3 and loves this app. She has learned so much!,
It charged me for the first month and now it says I still have to sign up and pay agian to access the app!!!!!,
The app barely if ever works for nabi dreamtab.  Would be great otherwise.  Canceling todsy,
Downloaded perfect but as soon as I opened the app it kept displaying an offline notice... Wouldn't work!!! Very disappointed.,
Daughter loves this site. It has so many things to do and really entertains and helps her learn! The best educational site for kids.,
It is an amazing and wonderful experience to watch a child's eyes open with amazement. Worth every penny,
Says its free on TV and when you download it but as soon as you open the app the want you to sign up with your credit card. FALSE ADVERTISING!!,
There are games that do not work on my Nook.I've reached out to support and they claim its fixed in updates but these updates are apparently not for nook?,
"App doesn't respond when trying to scroll through any type of selection, doesn't see an internet connect when on wifi, when on 4G LTE it still has a delay when you can actually play lessons. I haven't found any link in-app to report problems. My child and I expect more from a paid subscription service that has been established for quite some time now.",
My little one has learned alot from this program.,
Some of the lessons like the puzzles won't give credit for completing them,
"Was working great now none of the books,games, etc are ""clickable"" in the app.  Please fix ASAP",
The sam and pam book is not working at all I tried to finish the lesson with my son but it wont let us get through the Sam and Pam book anyone else have that problem with this program other than that great service,
"Just installed this and can't get past the ""getting started"" video. The video will not play and there doesn't appear to be a way to bypass it. Bummer :(",
"I downloaded this application on my Nexus 7 tablet for my 20 month old son. We signed up for the month long trial. The application worked great until lesson 4 now we can't get any response from it. We can't open or click on anything. I contacted customer support, so I guess we'll see what they say. I'm definitely not paying for something that doesn't work.",
Cant even open start up video BUT you have my credit card info!! Im not the only person with this issue.  ABC MOUSE FIX YOUR STUFF!,
"Once we are on the learning path, we click the next activity but nothing happens! She's cannot progress...",
"I am on WiFi but the app still says ""play offline or retry"" this pop up is annoying, if I am paying for this monthly it needs to be fixed!!",
Glad they finally made the app. Makes learning easy no matter where you are.,
"My girls would rather ""play"" on ABCmouse  rather than other games.",
Abc mouse is a great app but most of the time it stop suddently.,

The kids loved it on the computer and now they can enjoy playing it wherever we go!,
My 2 year old daughter LOVES it and she learns so much from it.,
Shouldn't need a credit card to view an app. I'm disappointed.,
"We use the computer version nearly every day, but this app keeps asking for a password when the kids switch users. I changed the settings to not require a password but it still asks for one.",
This is the best program for any child! Best money ever spent!,
My daughter learning so much in the little time she has been using it,
"Thank you for fixing the issues, my son is happy to be paying again",
ABC mouse has helped my child so much I love it and I tell everyone I know about it.,

My kids love it and works great...,

"The 5 year old continues to go back after finishing grade K.  with  more than 11, 000 tickets before starting school.  Is there an ap for upper grades?",
My,
FEB,
"Mind-blowingly many exercises, activities, things to try, and click on. And that's where the problem is. My four year old twins don't seem to learn much because they jump from activity to activity. And they don't learn the alphabet in any particular order because they are free to click on any exercise they want. So it requires adult supervison to encourage then to do the exercises. And many things require advance reading skills, so until they know how to read the app is like shooting in the dark for kids.",
"This app is good if your child isn't in a common core state. I live in Pa, and in PA we have PaCore. My son was in pre-k and did ABC mouse, and was still struggled in kindergarten because of the expectations of common core. So, believe me extra work might still be needed if your child struggles with the common core standards.",
"It used to work great but NOW IT LAGS, FREEZES, OR JUST WILLNOT RESPOND, my child get fustrated because he keeps trying but willnot allow him to do WHAT IT IS SUSPOSED TO DO, he is special needs sofustration is NOT good. I pay alot for this site, and they just cnt get it going right anymore, fix it then i will give it more stars or i will cancell",
"My four year old son has been using this app a year now and loves it. He is in preschool, so this is an additional aid that he has a lot of fun with and helps to develop not only academic skills but cognitive as well. Getting tickets to buy things for his ""room"" and taking care of his fish and hamster pets give him the extra ""wow"" factor that he really enjoys. Thanks.",
I used ABCMouse as an in home preschool (with additional activities I provided) for my 2 year old but she didn't learn anything. It just didn't seem to stimulate her at all. She was excited about the tickets some times but that was all. Maybe we'll try again when she's older.,
My daughter used ABC Mouse when she was 3 and we loved it then.  She was ahead of her peers in kinder and we stopped then. At that time you could only use it on desk top.  So excited for her to try the app.. So I'm saving the 5th star for the app,
"I have used this program for 3 years first starting out on the computer, this shouldn't be used as the only tool to teach your kids, but as a SAHM  who home schools her kids it is nice to allow one child to play on a great educational program that has a few different skill sets. I love the game and the interaction my kids are provided by this game. If you are having issues with the app don't give up on it it is also on the Web and it's FANTASTIC.",
The app crashes all the time. I have loaded it on 3 different  devices and get same results. With out standing over my child there is no direction and then when he finishes a task it does not recognize it. I canceled account and they still charged me. Not a happy moma!!!,
They could start with BIGGER buttons... but it ALSO needs continuous videos that run on their own... They should review the PBS Kids App and proceed from there.  My son has trouble using this app on his own. .. and I don't think he learns enough from it. ..,
"Its a great concept, but on android, there are still way to many bugs so the app doesn't flow smoothly or do what it needs to do which is a huge letdown. My three year old expressed more interest in it then when he was 1 or 2.  it seems like they charge for more and i hate feeling like im being nickeled and dimed to know my sons stats or to add my other kids on there.  I'm not sure he's  actually learning or if its deterring from his actual learning time in playing off the tablet/phone.",
"My daughter has learned a lot over the past year of using the site and the app and we definitely have gotten our money's worth. Of course it isn't free and no one should expect it to be. There is way too much information and hardware put into this for it to be given without some sort of profit. It is worth it to see my daughter having fun while learning  when sitting down and doing workbooks, etc with me just doesn't do it for her. Being that her father and I are both in college, it works well for us to all do our learning together. It makes her feel included and special. Couldn't be happier with the product. Thanks ABC Mouse. :)",
"My daughter gets bored very fast because of the way the app crashes. Now she's no more interested. It keeps freezing any time she's doing the puzzle. Now the only thing my other daughter likes is the nursery rhymes and that's it. She's not even catching the colors and alphabets. The activities looks the same way, nothing more, nothing less",
It's great for my kids. I think because my oldest daughter is in preschool and my youngest daughter is going to preschool this year they are better able to understand this. I wouldn't allow my baby boy to use this when he turns two or even my oldest son who is almost 9. I think the best ages for this is 3 to 7,
"Customer service is terrible.  For the price you pay, there should be live support, not an email only service.  Additionally, it should be made clear that a ""one-year subscription"" is actually automatically renewed every year, and the way it's presented is very misleading. Putting this in the VERY fine-print is only a step above thievery.  After being charged for another year when my child has not used the program in over a year is disgusting, especially when I was refused a refund.",
"I bought a full year because it was ""a better deal"".  It was way too easy and it kept on telling me that i lost internet connection.  When i cancelled my subscription in one day since purchase...they would not refund anything so now I'm stuck with a useless subscription for a year.  Whatevrr you do...do not buy...or you'll be making a 60 dollar mistake like myself.",
The best thing ever invited for children. My daughter is 5 years old and loves going onto ABCMOUSE.  it's wonderful Because NOT Only Is she is playing games she is learning too getting rewarded for completing each task.,
"My daughter can really only use this on the computer.  The app needs a LOT of work. So far a few things my daughter likes, most of the activities she's too advanced for and she gets bored.",
I have had ABC Mouse for 3 yrs and my 4 year old and 6 year old grandkids learned their abc's by sight before they were 4!  They love the tickets also but they love all the activities! !  They can sound out all their letters and have learned about vowels!!  They both have excelled  in pre school and kindergarden. It takes time for them to understand what they have to do but once they got it they took off learning!!!  Thanks for such a great program!!,
"Too many crashes. We've  had it on thr laptops for a while now and were excited to have it on the tablet, but its been a frustrating mix of crashes, freeze ups, and screen layouts completely useless on a mobile device,  it is not very helpful at all.",
"Bubble popping games that only include 2 colors, issues with the fact my son has to hit the same bubble or butterfly or shape six times before it registers, some games broken and don't work at all. The stories and singalong are short and without point. The classroom progression is boring and unusable for children, and no option to favorite the games he DOES like so that he can use the app without adult supervision and constant searches. The games are little mini games without real length or learning value. Overall very disappointed, not just in the glitchiness of the app, but in the program itself.",
"Updating as promised. It seems that the login requirement has been changed and therefore, this app is now awesome.  My daughter uses it all the time without any promoting. It's cute to hear her reading books. She will be farther ahead when she starts kindergarten.",
We love it on the computer but have issues with it on my sons nabi 2 tablet. He has issues actually completing the lessons because it won't load fully on the screen or freezes up or just won't let us select what needs to be done. Wish it worked as well on the tablets as on as laptop but over all a great program. Also think it would be good if the child had to complete a lesson before playing with pets etc because left up to my son that's all he would do.,
This app can be really great! It needs lots of bug fixes.  It pause and stop during mid  session. Also while reading a book the highlighting option does work at all. The list goes on and on of little problems.   Please fix and I'll give 5 stars,
"My baby looks forward to her ""learning time"" on her pbone. She has her own note three and her she loves sitting down with mommy and exploring on abc mouse. Definitely worth the money, but the app cannot replace interaction. If you are having your child play on here I encourage you to sit down with them and help guide them through it. Nothing beats parents teaching their children this app serves as a great template to teach your child",
"I've been able to put it on my devices finally.  It's working great.  It does become a little slow on doing puzzles and if my child could get to her animal pets, I would give it 5 stars.  Other than that love the app.",
"My son has been playing with this app since he was 1. He's almost 2 now and has figured how to navigate fairly well. He doesn't understand much of what's going on yet, but he knows how to get into coloring mode, listen to songs, and read books!",
Every time I put it on a song for my son it skips and doesn't play and if it does it skips the whole time will change rate when it is fixed,
The app is not compatible with my One touch note7 tablet so I can't use it to keep the kids busy while on the go. I really hope they fix it soon!!! My daughter is very smart but she's only 1yrs old she can use the app but it does not stop her from exiting a lesson.,
"It's a great app, but you have to supervise your child, in order for them to stay on one thing.",
Constantly saying that Internet connection is lost. Please fix and i will rate 5 star,
I think it's really crappy of you to advertise this as free but you have to add a credit card as soon as download is complete.,
To me it has a lot going with activities butt the buttons are not kid friendly they blend in with it all.,
I have a subscription on my pc for my two year old. She really learns the basics. We sit together daily.,
Equate of money. I have seen no improvement. There is no logical way to keep them on track. I watched them go from a to f then back to c then z. Now I've got a there year old even more confused than she started.,
The app is just as good as the site on PC. My son LOVES Abc Mouse and is more advanced than his peers at 4 with him being out of school for 8 months. He's more than prepared for Kindergarten with help from ABC Mouse!,
My daughter is in tears because we can't use the app. An error message stating that our Internet access has been lost. It comes in back and forth and keeps us from doing any activities.,
I downloaded the app...and I never signed up to make my family members yet..but I have been getting changed every month like I have and like I have been using it...we may have used it 2 weeks at the most...I know its my fault for not going in directly and canceling..but. Of bring a member I didn't think I had to wow..what will we get ripped off net with..there is noting but rip offs going on in this tech world.,
"It has a lot of potential, but the bugs are so bad and so frequent you can't use the apps fluently.",
A lot of the activities and lessons don't give instructions on what to do to pass the lesson. Very complicated especially for such young children.,
My grandson was not interested at. He just kept closing it & looking at other things. All i could get into was some baloons. So I'm not going to get a paid membership.,
"My daughter  has been on the program everyday  since school started, her test scores have gone through the  roof and she enjoys it everyday .",
I love this app...my 6yr old and 4 yr old boys are always asking for it...I also watch them to make sure that they stay on the learning path before they can visit the zoo or play with the hamster's or do the EXTRA GAME'S... the only down fall is trying to get the mouse to say my son's name correctly...(I keep sending in samples with me actually saying the name but they ignore it and still say it wrong...which makes my 4yr old sad to hear his brother's name but his name is completely wrong) :-(,
This was awesome  for my son. He was able to do the preschool through  1st grade curriculum. It made learning feel like a game.,
Tried to log in and it keeps saying won't connect to the internet. We love the online version but apps are easier for my toddler. This is disappointing. It won't even open. Problem on mobile and ipad.,
"my son should be doing this he starts school in a couple of months but i can not afford it being a single working mother, it should be free, since when should a child's education and learning cost money??  NEVER.... my son really needs this but there is other apps that are COMPLETELY  FREE that I guess would help him...",
I would give it 5 stars if there was a way to keep the smaller kids from back7ng out of it every other second.,
Great for independent practice on a limited time basis. Following directions. Use of technology. Etc. This is not a curriculum in itself. It is supplementary. We really enjoy it.,
This app has indeed helped my 2 year old be on level so now I don't need to worry to much  about her education.,
I think this is wonderful for children. My is 18 months and he is loving the songs and lessons. He is already trying to sing a long and is saying words.,
I've had a few issues with the app but nothing I'll speak to of. My boys each have this app on their tablets and have done better in school since having ABC Mouse!,
The app will freeze all the time or my daughter will finish an activity but it won't let her hit done! I paid a lot of money for this program and we mainly use my phone to access it. I want my money's worth.,
It was working great but for the past few days it has been freezing and keeps saying I'm off the Internet when I'm not.,
Both my 2 and five year old love this app. It does require adult supervision to keep them on course but I really wouldn't leave my kids alone with my tablet or laptop anyway.,
"(3/5/2015) It rarely works, downloaded this app a few month's back for my 3yo and was only able to use it 4x at the most. Please fix app, can't even access lesson plans or calendar from the classroom. It always says webpage not available. * (4/5/2015) just downloaded new update (2.6.16) and i still cant access lesson plans, calendar, etc. Keeps saying webpage not available, please fix. (4/13/2015) just installed this on my other tablet (tf201) and the app didnt work, same problems listed above. Please fix",
I have a 5 y.o and a 3 y.o. I love that I can tailor their levels to their needs. The phone app is a life saver for times when they need to be entertained but i still want them to be learning.,
I downloaded the app.and it won't let me get past making the avatar after I added they names I hit next and it stops working and closes the app.I restart it again and it does the same thing.after I done paid my money I can't even use it.even reinstalling it it still doesn't work,
Won't load after repeated tries on mobile app & computer. Great concept if it would work at all. Total scam at this point.,
My son picks a book from the library in the classroom (on this app) every night  and really learns and he's very excited to tell me about the planets and solar system....it's amazing,
"ABC Mouse is extremely instrumental in the early learning stages for my daughter. The designers have actually created a cyber school. It is so much fun and the most important part is, she is actually learning from Science to Reading to Math.Thanks !",
I am a busy momma of 5 and its hard to sit and work with my kids all the time but this program has been a awesome tool! My kids read the books to me and share their progress..also each of them have excelled up in their studies because of this program and are doing awesome in school! Love it!,
I like all the activities I just wish they made it ssh the kids couldn't back out of the lessons and couldn't just keep guessing till they got the answer right. Other than that it's great,
I have it on the nabi2 & it keeps freezing. Please help I don't have this problem on desktop,
You should put on here that's it's not free that you have to have a credit card cuz I have never had a credit card there for I can not get this for my son even though it says free it's not! You need to change that!,
I hate to have  to pay more for ever thing my granddaughter clicks on    I never expected to have to pay more for the alphabet.  really did upset me after what we paid,
"First off it was complicated even for me, secoundly we couldn't get passed the first level due to a mic problem. Ridiculous.",
Constantly being rerouted when trying to cancel. Offers to stay get better than you initially paid! Click settings or the parent icon and you have to type in your password EVERYTIME!  HATE IT!,
"It kinda was stupid. Song were bad, puzzles were bad just not fun for my child.",
We love the website however it freezes all the time and my 2 year old daughter gets frustrated when after the third or fourth time it doesn't work she is done with it. Please fix!,
It says u can get first month free but it dosnt let u unless u pay first n give them ur credit card number . Not every1 can afford dis app,
"Every time I open app, it tells me ""no internet connection"". I have Wi-Fi also 4g lite but app will not connect. This is the only app that does this.. please fix. Samsung Galaxy s5",
My kid actually chooses to play this app over all other games on my phone. Couldn't be more pleased!,
"The Android app may be free & it has a free trial, but it still wants you to BUY their curriculum for $7.99.  Sorry, but the free app is misleading.",
I am willing to see within a seven-month process how long it will take my son to be able to read without help I will do a follow-up within that 7 month period this month is November so in June I will be back to rate ABC Mouse thanks for your time,
"Our granddaughter loves to play this one!! Vocab, has increased amazingly, she is soooo smart.. Praise the lord.. Amen. Thanks each and every 1 of family and my friends who helped us supported us and prayed for us also.  Laurie & Ray....",
I keep getting an error message.,
She hasn't put her tablet down.  This is just a baseline of what's to come.  This allows her to familiarize what's to come in Kindergarten.,
We use this alot our computer broke down so we are forced to play on my phone the app keeps going to the sign in page but not giving the option to sign in.. sad we are missing lessons please fix,
CALL you have a great time with you guys have a great weekend too late now but I'm sure I have no money and you are so cute together with you in y understand that the one who is that what you're doing well with............,
A little difficult for a toddler to navigate. Doesn't keep my daughters attention. Lots of the application freezing thoroughly programming. Tons of other free educational applications that are not at problematic.,
Internet Error message keeps popping up Every time I click on something,
Something about this program that finally you're able to do it on the tablet and on the phone so it works pretty well for my 3 year old outstanding service outstanding quality and always updated very good keep up the good work,
"My daughter learned so much using this app. Great alternative for kids to use, instead of playing other apps. This is mom approved!!",
Both of my boys love abc mouse. Glade to see it works great on the phone now and a lot faster than the actual website.  Thinking about getting a ipad mini or a galaxy tab for my oldest will this app work on them also?,
Im not understanding why it says its free but when you open the app it only wants you to sign up for 30 days free... Can we say false advertising!. Thanks for wasting my time on downloading this app,
It doesnt recognize that im connected to the internet.,
It is the best thing for my brother than co you for making the best thing ever.,
"I love this app for my son, would be great if I could store it in my sd",
They have learned so much and it's nice to be able to help them learn and play together.,
"Many great activities that enhance the preschool experience, and reinforces what is being taught.",
"Really great !!! He loves playing this app, he thinks its so awesome that he learns and can get tickets to buy hamsters and etc!!!!",
I love this app for my daughter. She enjoys learning due to ABC mouse. Best app ever. Thanks a million ABC mouse.,
But it won't install on our tablet... says unsupported on this device... sad.,
The only complaint I have is the lack of kid locks... I would love to see a feature that kept my child from accessing other parts of the phone/tablet. Otherwise... It's fantastic!,
He loves it,
There's a little lag using on my galaxy s3,
"I absoluely love ABC Mouse! My 2 year old is excited to learn, and can now recite his abc's and count to 20! I tell everyone about ABC Mouse!",
I have two boys that are ages two and six. They both love it and it helps me so much with their learning.,
Its boring and they auto renew and continue to charge your card....my daughter stopped using it a year ago i i just now realized they were still charging me money every month......üò°,
Finally an android app!!  Have had a subscription for over a year and it was a waste of money till now. Almost canceled but my 3yr old asks for it all the time.,
My boys love it! Ages 2+4,
Dont get this app. Horrible. Steals your money. Dumb for kids,
I was about to cancel my subscription when I realized they finally made an app for android. Wonderful!,
My daughter loves that her progress is saved and she can go back and forth between the computer and app,
"My granddaughter loves this app, can't get enough",
My daughter loves this app and learns so much. Well worth the $8 a month.,
Love it & so does my 3 year old  grandson.,
"My grandchildren love playing this game, and at the same time they are learning!",
As a SAHM who is interested in homeschooling this app has been an excellent tool for my preschooler.,
"My son loves this app, learns so much from it and myself as a teacher also love it. Great job!",
I can not afford this learning should be free.,
My son love it he learned so much very good app..,
Uninstalled application as money requested subscription upon opening.,
My son is very excited to start,
My kid loves it and so do I. He is constantly learning,
My daughter doesn't know she's learning!,
Its good for children agrs three and up it helps my brothers üòÉüòÉüòäüòäüòãüòå,
My baby is ecstatic about learning. She picked up her primary colors on the first day!,
I love the fact that children can use it under the guidance of parents or independently.,
And it's not even glitchy.,
This app is great for little ones to learn early.,
My little sister is learning stuff very fast and its an awesome app if i could i will thumbs up 1000 times,
I love rating because it makes me show how much I love that app,
Great for additional homeschooling curriculum. Been using ABC Mouse  for 2 years and my son loves it!,

Update sucks,
Lieh,
Abc mouse,

"Our boy loves the web version. The app itself is pretty good, but it is a dog. It's so unresponsive that it's barely usable. They need to speed this up or stop using Flash as the underpinnings, because it is a resource hog.  Update: They listened and it has steadily gotten more responsive with each new update. It still plays 2nd fiddle to the iOS app and that's a shame. There should be parity.",
"Constantly logs my daughter out, freezes while she's playing which causes her and me frustration. Just not paying off for a 3 year old. She's not very good at navigating on the desktop, so this is her only option. It would be great if the app was worth what we pay every month.",
Disappointed.  For the amount of money we are paying per month for the service ABC mouse is so far behind in technology. I feel as though I am wasting my money as my son works better with a tablet than he does with the desktop. And this app doesn't prove worthy of a four-year-old using it,
I bought 2 tablets for my twins so they could play ABC mouse on them. We get home only to find out that the device is incompatible. Please fix. Will be canceling subscription soon if not fixed. Don't like having our phones tied up all the time.,
Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10: This app won't even load before it crashes.  It plays the intro thing with the mouse then does nothing. After a while it says there was an error and restarts when you select okay. Really disappointing as we've been customers for several years.,
Requires me to log in every time my child uses it will not keep profiles straight on different tablets. I had trouble completing the dot to dot puzzle for  my 6 year old because it required tapping 1 first even though that was the starting point.the balloons just won't pop.,
"My daughter is 4 years old now. We started to do the alphabet, number counting and reading when about two. She does have adhd so to get her to focus on one thing is hard. She started abc mouse on her 4th birthday and I really regret not starting on it faster. She has improved so much faster on all learning skills and levels than we could do with books or paper. Abc mouse is a great tool to use for learning on and off the computer. Plz if you are thinking about it. Stop thinking and do it now",
"Not only was I disappointed to find out you have to pay a monthly fee for it, I was even more upset that something I'm paying for is so buggy, laggy and just does not work right. My daughter gets more frustrated with it than she has fun with it. Fix your product if you want people to enjoy it.",
"My 5 year old is having trouble in reading so I got ABC mouse to help him with that, instead it has him coloring and doing shapes and stuff he already can do regardless what level it is set to, when we go to the section specifically related to sight words it just says a sentence containing that word. =/ on the hunt for another learning app",
Unless u have desktop it won't work so I paid the fee not knowing it wouldn't work and now I'm going through hell to delete the account I've tried every way possible even contacting the customer service. It's such a sad thing to promote a good site then scam people. Very dissapointed!,
I have heard lots of wonderful things about ABC mouse. It looks like it's set up very well. It looks like a wonderful website where lots of learning can be experienced by four and five year olds but it just isn't working. The pets that she has worked so hard to achieve don't do anything and she doesn't understand that. It frequently gets stuck  And then it won't let her move on to the next environment even though she completes those assignments. I'm disappointed I feel for the money it should offer more.,
"Had the subscription for a year for my 4 year old, but once she started school she barely used the app and became bored with it. It does glitch and stop working right in the middle of it. Canceling is a nightmare. They will only give u partial refund. If your going to cancel make sure you do it before your card gets charged again before your renewal date. I will never purchase service from this company ever again.  This app is not worth it. Save your money!",
"When trying to access a page it says, ""cannot detect wifi connection"".  Im at home with wifi and everything else is working, so it cant be my connection.  This is the only app that gives me constant trouble and its one I actually paid for.  Free apps work better.  Disappointed.",
The only fix the app needs is being able to  access the pet park. I haven't found it anywhere. My son has 4 pets besides the aquarium and hamster he cares for along with his lessons that he does every day. By the time we get to a computer to take care of them that same day it shows they are all sad. The website is great though!,
"I was excited about the abc Mouse app finally on android, and working. It's a bit laggy at times but overall it's fine. My kids generally use the desktop computer anyway. My major gripe is that if you don't use the app after about a day or two, it forgets your login info. That's really annoying. If I'm not there, my kids can't use the app, which sucks! Most apps keep you logged in unless you logout. That's how this should work as well.",
"The app keeps crashing and it is very frustrating. When it works, it is a good program. Very wee rounded with basic phonemic awareness activities and games that apply lezrned skills. I wish there were more games that had the students apply the skills. The games are very basic znd only review the skills learned in that lesson. I would like to see more spiral reviews in each lesson to ensure retention of skills. I would rate this app as a depth of knowledge level 1 overall. Not challenging and very little application. There is definitely potential, but not quite there yet!",
I've had this program for over a year for my three -year-old and I just downloaded this app. The website is great but the app is awful. It freezes all the time and it frustrates my daughter. Its to the point where she refuses to play anymore. Will be deleting this app and going back to website on my laptop. Very disappointing,
My 4 year loves ABC MOUSE on the computer and now on my phone but it consistently logs her out while she's playing on the mobile app which frustrates her and of course requires me to sign her in again. Haven't figured out why it does that yet. If that gets addressed or fixed then would consider this a 5 star app. Galaxy S4 phone and android kit kat tablet same issue,
Really frustrating for my kids to be playing maybe 5mins and then it crashes. You can't even close out and go back in. I liked the idea of app so they could play on tablets but it stinks,
"I constantly have to unistall/re-install app. Games freeze. It irritates my 4 yr-old, who's tablet literate. The concept and activities are educational but futile if the app is not compatible with android.",
We have been using ABC mouse on the computer for awhile and so happy they have an app for android!  There are only a few minor bugs I've come across but they aren't a big deal. I think our experience improved since I bought a new phone with more processing power. Older devices might have more trouble.,
"I am giving 3 stars because.. 1. Out of our 3 tablets this app only works on one, 2. Too many log in requests,  and 3. Big families with many kids can't use their own name.                      My 3 year old son loves this app though.",
"My Daughter loves this app and has learned her numbers, alphabets, hand eye coordination and logical reasoning skills using the software. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with young preschool age toddlers. Thanks for making the app compatible with Android OS...",
"We started abc mouse with my 2 year old son yesterday and he loves it,  the App today however does not work correctly,  the base pages load but none of the activities,  tried uninstalling and reinstalling and logging out and back in... don't want to cancel the subscription but I can't see keeping it if it doesn't work correctly",
"My 4, 3, & 2 yr olds really love ABC mouse.  The website is hard for my two yr old so I got some tablets. Is it just me or do you have to keep uninstalling and downloading the app? It's really nice when it's working,  but sometimes it goes blank when trying to get on.  Please fix it.  Please. Tired of having to uninstall, then installing in order for it to work again.",
"I don't understand the point of an app that does not work. My 2 yo loves abc mouse on the computer. We homeschool and only have 1 computer in our house. Of course the school aged kids have priority. I would love to be able to sit down and use this with my young child. It really makes me wonder why I pay for something that can rarely be used. Please fix the bugs. We are very disappointed. And btw, we have a samsung note 10.1 2014. There should be no reason that a new OS isn't compatible.",
"I was really looking forward to this app however, I can't even create my profile in order to get started. It won't let me add my name the keyboard won't even show up. I signed in with the free month deal maybe that's the problem, if you pay first it will work. Very disappointed",
this site is great on the  pc but as for the app totally sad needs some work.  please correct the issues so these kids can enjoy the benefits of learning and playing on their tablets or any tings that require them to down load.,
"My 3 and 4 year old have this on their tablets, and love it. However, they get so frustrated because it frequently crashes and kicks them out to the login screen where I have to reenter our information so they can start over after it forgets their progress. Its also frustrating to see the disappointed looks when They spend the tickets they earn for prizes they never get. Not sure why this happens. Also when in learning path it says click here to go to current lesson and won't let him in to the activities.",
My youngest has been using ABC Mouse for a year now and can't get enough of this app.,
"My kiddos love ABC mouse the problem is they aren't very good with the computer. So I downloaded the app, unfortunately there isn't much they can do because so much of it isn't compatible I do have the free month but at the end of it I'm going to cancel unless this can be done.",
My son is 3 years old and he has been using this for a year an he has always loved it and stays entertained  while learning! He is in in preschool about ready for pre k now this app is amazing! And I also have. Niece who gets side tracked easy and even if she does get off the learning path and into the games it don't matter because everything about this app is educational and fun!,
"Great, but we NEED it to be able to flip. To use this app we have to hold up our tablet for our son to see it all. If it can rotate the other way i can stand up my tablet. Rotation is a basic necessity for a tablet program, you guys are so slow on this stuff.",
"I have had a subscription for almost a year and have never used it because our laptop went out and they didn't have an app yet. I wax excited to see they had the app but I can't even do anything on it without it force closing, it is very frustrating because my 3 yr old wants to play but cant. Please fix and I might renew my subscription!  Using Nook Hd 7""",
"I've had this program since my first daughter who is five now, and I love it. ABC mouse has taught her so much and she loves it. I like that I can toggle between my 5yr old and 3yr olds profiles!  I will also mention as I see people saying the app is buggy , keep in mind abc mouse was originally made for computer, they just recently rolled out the app, so of course they will need to do some tweaking and fine tuning and to me its almost something that is just gonna operate better on PC.",
"The app is good, but my daughter kept getting bored after awhile. Be careful when you sign up, they are sneaky, when you cancel they will still charge money. I've had horrible customer service with them twice because of it. The lady said I had to cancel both charges but I canceled the subscription and there's no way I can cancel that monthly fee since the account was closed. She said I would not get a refund since I had a refund in the past. Seems like they are just out for your money. I tried to give them a second chance but after this I've learned my lesson. Horrible customer service!",
"My son LOVES this app, but it keeps crashing so he doesnt get to play for long. Very disappointing",
"Can't rate this five stars, my son can only play it on my Samsung note four but not compatible with my LG tablet",
I signed up for my daughter to play on her Kurio 10S with Android tablet and it is not compatible with her service.  I still give 5 stars this is fixed. It works fine on my Galaxy S3 so I would think it would work with her tablet.,
Really love the app makes it easier for my kids to learn then being on the computer all the time I have it installed on my samsung tab 2 and everything is great there are a few minor bugs in it like the reading section turns off on its own when it finishes without any interaction and there are a few bugs in the basic section for the app and ABC mouse has a disclaimer that says they are working on that section overall it's really great and I can live with the bugs they don't impact my kids learning. I use this as home school and it is really helping! My kids are 4 & 2.,
was extremely disappointed to find that after I purchased the app it is not compatible with my Android platform. Now I am trying to figure out how to get my refund for the annual charge I just paid via paypal. Extremely. Dissatisfied! !!!!!,
"I love ABC Mouse. I have seen much improvement in my 4 and 3 year old, and when my 1 year old becomes of an appropriate age, she will use this program. With that being said, im rating the app, not the program. The app is loaded with bugs. My 3 year old finds it easier to use this app on a tablet vs an actual mouse on PC. The app is constantly freezing up at the end of his ""learning path"" which prevents him from advancing. I have to log him on the PC in order to get past bugs. It needs to get fixed, especially since I'm making monthly payments. Pkease fix this app ABCMOUSE!",
My daughter has been using abc mouse for over 2 years now and loves it. Happy we are able to have the app for our phone.,
Worked great via the website. Now we have to use this app that freezes all the time and you have to log in every time. This is getting ridiculous my child isn't learning anything because of this app and it's a waste of money,
"My three year old son loves ABC mouse. I love that he is learning. Sometimes the app runs slow, but other than that its great.",
I purchased this program for my niece to use on her own tablet and it's not compatible with it. I purchased her the tablet so that she wouldn't have to have my phone or laptop so much. Please update so that the app is available for all devices.,
I paid for the app $60 I believe. It doesn't even work properly on my daughters tablet.  I'm very disappointed.,
Please fix problem. Tablet is what my 3 year old uses. If not fix will cancel membership.,
"I love abc mouse but the songs  freeze constantly,  the lesson progress  is jumbled often makes my daughter go back and forth even after she's completed something.  Would rate 5 stars if the bugs can be worked out my daughter  really does love this and she is growing wonderfully.",
"I find the program useful, but it has several glitches when used on my Samsung Galaxy tablet.",
I am starting to believe that I am just throwing money down the drain. It always freezes and I always have problems with it. I am constantly having to contact customer service and I have installed and Unistalled several times!  You would think that this would be a great app!! The few times that my daughter is able to actually play it's great! Please fix or will soon  Unistall for good!,
"I love it but it keeps freezing, this needs to be fixed asap. My 4 year old does it all the time and loves it but keep having to stop cause the lesson keeps freezing up on him",
"It's a great app on my galaxy note 4 sometimes you do have to log in again I don't know why... it freezes up sometimes ,why.   But other wise it's a great learning tool for my 3 yr old .",
I like the app on the computer but on my galaxy note 3 it keeps signing me out over and over again. Please fix the problem.,
"This is everything a child needs to learn before entering school, so that they will have a jump start.",
I can't even install the app on my phone.  No happy about that.  Should have mentioned that before I paid for a supscription.,
I'm running a galaxy s4 and all this app does is crash on me after I login. I'm paying 8 bucks a month for something unusable outside of the website. Fix the glitch and I can rate it again.,
"Downloaded on my phone and my son had 270 tickets. He purchased items for his hamster and furniture and although the tickets were deducted, the items were never given. He is truly disappointed and so am I.  He has worked hard for those tickets.",
This is a great program for early childhood. Children progress through leveled learning and age. I use it in my class and at home with my 2 year old granddaughter.,
"I hate that the app keeps crashing. It freezes up a lot while he's trying to play. We can't get passed level 2 lesson 12 because its frozen. And we can't get it on his tablet which is a Kurio 7S, it keeps saying that its not compatible! He's using my tablet (Nexus 7) which makes his tablet pointless..So I had to take a star away for that as well. Once that is fixed, I will update my reviews and give all stars!",
ABC has withdrew money from my account without consent. I am unable to reach anyone at customer service and staff never returns calls.  I will be contacting the attorney generals office. I never authorized the funds to be removed from my account.  Shame on ABC mouse.,
"Galaxy Tab3 and Kindle Fire, both are having issues with this app. The error says the page has a permanent new address and to try again later. Very disappointing.",
My 2 year old wakes up saying mouse because he wants to go back to the site. We love abcmouse.,
Good at the actual games and stuff but it closes everyday up to five or six times it closes when i have only used it ten to twenty min,
It will randomly turn to a gray screen when turning to books. I use asus transformer. I have tried to reinstall update and restart. Disappointed for a paid app.,
"Ill start with the negative first: It is getting pretty annoying to have to login and re-login and login again every single time you open the app or switch to another app and come back and have to login again and again and again. Seriously your app has alzheimers. Is there such a great security threat here that I must login after the app sits idle for ten minutes? Are there state secrets on here or something? Seriously I think government sites require less frequent login and lock outs. If someone steals my info on abc mouse then they must be seriously motivated and you probably could not stop them anyways, so how about lightening up a bit, offer an option to remain logged in on mobile devices for at least a day. I think I need to log back in after writing this now because it took me five minutes to do.                      The positive: This app runs great on my android device, it did not work on my old tablet so I think everyone complaining it does not run on android probably has older devices. My daughter and son love abc mouse and beg to play on it daily, and they actually learn and retain the knowledge and impress me on a daily basis with how much they have progressed.",
Nothing works!!! When it comes to the 5 ticket activites it only gives three when playing on the galaxy s4. When reading books the pages wont turn so my daughter only sees the fist page of the entire book. When the abc mouse app comes on it no longer says her name like it did the entire 1st year we purchased abc mouse. for almost $100 a year for this program I am so so very disappointed on how it's working the second time we purchased it. And as consumers we should be given a number to contact this company,
There are no sound on activities and exercises.  As soon as you enter into an activity the sound is off. There is no way to turn on the volume. I turn the volume on the speaker to max and there is no sound. Very disappointed for a paid service.,
Got this for my two year old.  He is very rambunctious and has a hard time sitting still through book readings. With ABC mouse he is able to play educational games and is engaged the whole time.  The investment in his education is worth it!,
Some have failed to remember this a app not the website. My sons love it and it really does help keep them motivated  to learn.,
"I was told to get this for my daughter that it would help her in her  problem areas in her school work. Well after being told numerous of times and watching commercial after commercial about it, I finally downloaded it. Let's just say it's NOT what I thought.",
"The app doesn't even work on my daughter's tablet, I've tried everything, abc mouse isn't getting another dime of my money until this is fixed",
App has issues with default profile and passwords. Contacted support and got responses that demonstrate they don't actually read what you write. Now on my fifth email with no resolution...,
I love this app it teach my little girl so many things. I can't stop telling my friends about ABC mouse,
Wont stop loading  for daughter  to play. And we have 4 tablets (new) and only 1 will allow app to be downloaded.  Please fix,
My son started with ABC Mouse when he was three and he is now 6 and still logs on Everyday to learn. My son is advanced in his class in reading and Math because of ABC Mouse.,
The app has a bug that really need to be fix every now and then I have to uninstall and download the app again and it still may not work. My kids love the app but it hard trying to keep it running long enough for them to learn something.,
"Downloaded this as a surprise for my kid. Tried to open it and a ""video cannot play"" message popped up & then it wanted me to sign in to an existing account...? I don't have any existing account and have no idea how to get one. Very disappointed.",
This is such a sketchy version of the actual ABC Mouse website. I would figure for the monthly rate we pay the functionality would be much greater than it is. The songs which follow on the computer hardly follow on my Note 3 and never do on my iPad. A successful port across multiple platforms means at least spending some time working out the kinks. I think on the android version at least some time is needed to go back and test it.,
"This is the best app for kids. My 3.5 yr old can't get enough. There are endless games, books, educational stories, songs, math, language, incentives, etc. All the other Thomas the Train apps we've spent money on was a waste in comparison! This is like preschool- not a replacement but great for busy parents and active children.",
"Okay, app but it will not let her complete all of level 5 lesson 3. The balloon game for the letters d,e,f will not work.",
My Lil sister's teacher came to me and my mom and said that she just went off with her reading,
I can not log in through this app. Fix this problem it is a big inconvenience especially with the fact that my child loves the site.,
Really not sure how a two year old learns anything by hitting letters and numbers half covered up. In other puzzles of animals or objects the names  are cut off 95% of the time. Can't download on android tablet,
App constantly crashes. Only have a tablet and phone. Can't have my son on a laptop cause I don't have one yet. Removing the app canceling my subscription.,
Paid 1.99 to open up games then now I need to enroll. Want my two bucks credited. Not what I was offered. Very disappointed. I understand the whole app is great just can not afford that a month at the moment.,
The only thing I don't like is you have to be online to do most of the activities.,
My daughter loves this program! It is also helping me teach her everything she needs to know to be ready for first grade. We moved out to Pennsylvania to help my father recover from an accident and out here they wouldn't let her got to Kindergarten because of her age even though she was going into Kindergarten back home. So I made the decision to home school her so when we return to Colorado she will have not missed out on an entire year of schooling. ABCmouse has helped her and she will be ready for 1st gr,
"This should not cost as much as it does,  but for my son, I would pay any amount to help him learn, so I am guessing other parents fall into that same trap ..",
"I didnt realize I could increase the levels, I thought this app was for preschool. It's nice thta he can still use it to reinforce kindergarten education.",
I thought abc mouse was free to educators and I told several parents what a great resource the  program was.  Now it's only free for a month. Very disappointed.  I wll not be able to use in class room!,
"My daughter loves ABC Mouse! She is always asking for it and she isn't even 2 yet. But, it was clearly released as an app too soon. It is very glitchy and  will close itself then reopen in the middle of books, games, and other features. It took us over 4 tries to get through a ""read to me"" book with all of the glitches. Sometimes the screen will have large black boxes moving across it. The only reason it gets a 3 is because it's a good idea and my daughter loves it. If she didn't love it so much it would be a 1 or 2. It needs some work",
"crashes constantly. please fix, love the app on the tablet, but completely worthless if it only crashes. waste of time and money",
My 5 yr old loves this app. She enjoys being able to interact and choose her own activities and I love she's learning the whole time.,
Would be a 5 star but there are a few bugs in the game like on the pop and peek level the balloons won't pop,
It was great but it messed up on level 3 lesson 16 i had 're uninstall then reinstall it for it to work,
"This app sucks, never works. News flash, kids are using tablets in school not lap tops so please fix the bugs.",
"Great learning website for my children. They absolutely love it. One downside, is needing to log in everytime they want to play it, or change users.",
What good is this app if you cannot play or interact with it. Guess I have to look for other app for my boy.,
She's engaged and learning and it's awesome. Also she can be on ABC MOUSE and I know she's in a safe zone,
Would rate 0 if possible  app crashes every time I log in and I'm paying for this I will be canceling,
We have had abcmouse for a year and our 1 and 2 yr love it and so do we but we are a bit disappointed it isnt compatible with our samsung galaxy note 10.1 tablet  we know the tablet would be so much easier for them to navigate especially during travel times so please make it compatible and i will give 5 stars and a glowing review.                               Update... we are about to cancel please address this and evidently im not the only parent displeased,
"They just love it,i just need like some instructions because i wannt my 5 years old to do more then paint. Thank you Abc mouse",
Great program on the computer and now on the go while at the store or on a trip. Thanks for finally making an app for Android devices that are compatible.,
I was able to download to my phone but not to my son's tablet which is a newer version LG. App is not compatible. I canceled. No point in paying for a service that can only be used in such a limited capacity.,
Jennifer   Tucker  you better hush up this game is lovely enyway let me leave all you're  you stinks to. Who ever you are i sure u ugly,
I have a 2 and a 5 year old. I love that they have different profiles and the activities are geared toward their ages,
"I was trying to set up this for my grandson and the textboxes in the application are broken, or can't operate properly. I can't type anything, not even a keyboard will pop up. Please fix asap",
"But so many problems.   A ton of crashes, it lags and logs out frequently.  It's definitely time to update the app.",
"She doesn't know she's learning, she thinks it just cool games",
my kids couldn't play. kept freezing and had to reinstall 2 times already and still froze.,
My two year old loves this app. She has learned so much I am amazed at her sometimes.,
My four year old loves the games when they work right.....but they almost never do. If the bugs in the programs were fixed then it would be 5 stars.,
Constant crashing makes this app SO worthless.  My 4 year old is almost at the point of surpassing what's offered.,
Its done installing I'm nine and i just wanna see what this is k its stupid so dumb,
I absolutely love this program! It is so very helpful for teaching my grandchildren the fundamentals of education. They love it so much that they actually fight over how much time each child spends on it. Keep up the good work.,
I love this site. My son is really starting to gt the hang of it. Im going to use it with my two youngest also. Just wish that i had this back when my oldest was at the age of learning to read and getting ready for school.,
It's frustrated for my 3 year old when the application freezes all the time. It's to be fixed or I'm uninstalling it.,
This is a great app if you have one of the few devices that work with it I'm running android 4.2 in most of my devices and it won't work but my newest tablet running 4.4 android works..fix it!,
"Keeps our two year old busy and she loves learning her alphabets, numbers, zoo animals, songs, games and so much more.",
"I wish we could switch the direction the screen flips but all in all, it's wonderful!  My 4 year old daughter begs to play.",
"The whole point of getting this subscription was for my son to have it on his tablet. Everything used to work good. Not anymore, now just crashes all the time. Will not be renewing subscription.",
Its not working right it won't save her work she does its frustrating please fix now or I won't do it anymore,
I feel it gave my daughter an opportunity to learn at an earlier age and still made it fun for her to keep going back.,
My daughter loves the games and fun. But some times the videos don't play and the games crash. Uninstall and reinstall didn't fix the videos. Please fix this.,
I have downloaded this on my tablet and phone and still unable to create an account.  Can only click on the Learn more link,
My kids love this. The only problem we can't log in on my phone. Other than that my 4 & 2 yr olds play on this all the time,
My daughter loves it. She has completed all levels and still goes on the site! I hope your expanding the curriculum to higher grades.,
My kids love this app. Just  logs them out a lot and I have to keep login for them need to fix that one problem,
"As an educator, I am always looking for the best learning games for my children, and ABC mouse is on target for what a child should learn before going to Kindergarten.",
"Recommend it 200%. My daughters love it. They sing, they read, they do math, they take care of pets. They just can't get enough. They absolutely love it. And I'm more than happy for that.",
I bought this app with the one year subscription and now I am regretting. After 3 minutes of playing my daughter keeps calling me because this app is turning the screen black!and the whole tablet is frozen. We have no problems with any other app! Please fix it or I want my refund!,
Wish both tablets could be logged in to different profiles and stay that way. I have to keep switching because eveytime one logs in the other tablet changes to that profile.,
The app has started crashing recently. Some of the newer games stop halfway thru.,
"Once you have an app that works on actual tablets and not just iPad, kids can start using this program. Until then, it's a waste of money.",
I have nothing but trouble keeping this app open.. it keeps closing when my son tries to play,
My little sister didnt even want to learn and now she does and she gets it right omg so worth paying for,
My son loves abc mouse. Im glad that i can actually log in with my phone cause he ask to play all day everyday. It keeps him busy when we are not at home.,
The app opened then when the Sogn on screen came up I hadn't signed up yet so went to the learn more and when it finally loaded the page was blank. .. Please fix. ..,
Lets the kid sign out on the side panel which means your constantly logging back in. Not worth a monthly payment of 8 bucks until fixed.....,
"Constant crashes to the point that my 4 year old is unable to use. I will be deleting the app and canceling my account. Its a shame, my daughter loves this program",
Started my daughter on abc mouse almost 4 years ago.  Love what it has done for us so much that we just recently started our son on the site as well!,
My little cousin loves playing these games especially on my phone because he can take it wherever he goes.,
"So glad there is finally an app that works on our tablet for this, its great!  We have used abc mouse for years , this is an amazing program and I highly recommend it.",
The app would probably be good if it would stop signing out constantly makes it almost unusable for my 4 year old. I also find it a little confusing especially for something that is supposed to be used by fairly young children,
My 3 year old daughter absolutely loves the games. She quickly learned to recognize letters and their sounds. I highly recommend it!,
My daughter loves playing the games and earning the tickets. She has learned so much in such a little time.,
"This program was a huge disappointment. Everything takes forever to load, or it will freeze. Would not recommend to anyone. Tomorrow morning I am calling to cancel my subscription. With all the money abcmouse uses to advertise you would think they could get good software. Things we did want to try and clicked on, a pop up would say that abcmouse was working hard to get this feature working......how are you supposed to explain that to an excited 5 year old!???. Very lame. There are plenty of free apps better than this.",
Installed fine. Opened up. Logged in. Never opened again. I try everyday. Please tell me if I am doing something wrong.  Been waiting for 2 years to get this on my android.,
"I have this app on my iPhone, galaxy note, and low end zeki tablet. My son loves it and so do I.",
The only thing I don't like is that there is no lock to keep a kid on the app and not closing it out easily.,
Is an amazing app my granddaughter is learning the basic to prepare for kindergarten.  Love it the best Christmas present ever.,
"I loved the idea. My son really likes the website, but the app keeps crashing. Fix it and the rating will go up to 5 stars.",
just say upfront 8 bucks a months. you have to pay to use app. don't even download it cause you have to have cc to login to try it out.,
It crashes all the time will keep my daughter  on the computer  instead,
It won't even let me get passed the menu. Keeps saying page not available,
My grandson is having trouble reading. This has helped him so much Thank you.,
I believe in this program enough to have shared our family's story on a commercial for them. My son Michael really blossomed because of the program. I would recommend this to ANYONE with children of all ages.,
We cannot complete a lesson without the app crashing and force closing a few times. This is gettng frustrating. I don't want to open up a full laptop for my 2 yr old to access it through the internet. Fix this or I won't be continuing. It's a waste of $,
My son is 3 and this app is friendly and fun for him to use. He reminds me to play on it even when I forget,
"My now 4 year old has learned so much in the last two years than my now 6 year old did in pre-k, and now that my son is in the first he can read on a 3rd grade level. Thank you ABC MOUSE",
My brother is autistic and he needs more learning he is my youngest brother and it is helping he is in kindergarten 5 so awesome:-D,
It worked just fine the first day. Now I can't get into it. My son really likes it and it is extremely easy for him to use. Please fix the problems!,
My son has used it since two and now his 5. We have seen a definite academic gain. He also loves the different habitats and the many learning games. Never bored.,
Doesn't allow you to do some things that can be done  on website but still good.,
"Totally frustrating!  The twins love the program, BUT it is not compatible with any of our tablets so they have limited access.  Very disappointing.",
App lags. When you push on something it takes a little bit to do anything which is frustrating for a toddler.,
Have to restart the tablet to get it to work again,
"This app is great for my 3&4 year old preschoolers, wonderful learning and review styled in with games and activities!",
My daughter had started it for a couple weeks and I can already see  the progress. Her vocabulary expand and her thinking process were amazing.,
My daughter loves this program! She's learning to read and Abcmouse has really helped her. I've recommended it to many friends and family members with small children.,
If people are complaining to update to more devices then maybe you should listen. If it only works on iPad then your wrong doing for not allowing kids without iPad play this. Hdx fire tablet and Samsung s5 is not compatible!  Wouldn't  let me give it one star.,
"The web sight is great but the app sucks it always frezzes ans crashes not a very reliable app ,Please fix it !!!",
"Irs a great app for my 4 year old. But it keeps freezing,  and it doesn't  give him his tickets at the end. Please fix it!!",

"My 2, 4, and 6 year old love the website, but the app frequently crashes or won't load at all. It's very frustrating. If it worked properly I'd give it 5 stars.",
My son's in PreSchool and is using this app in class. Thanks to his teacher that he has free access to this app and He loves it. He's now learning so much more.,
Too many glitches. It would close on its own then my daughter would have to go back and start all over. Very frustrating!,
"My 2 year old loves this app, im already thinking of getting 2 more tablets for the twins",
"So I buy the full year of the service, and the app crashes everytime. Try and go through the website instead and tells me I have to use the app that crashes. Awesome!",
"I will never get this again...it will not load all the pages all the time, and its not at all what it says it is",
"The app has quit working. It let's me get in, but am unable to click on any activities. It does the same thing on my galaxy s5. Please fix very soon, or I'm ending my subscription. I tried customer service through app, but that isn't working  either.",
Great app when it's working! My son will be in the middle of a lesson and it freezes! Even when I close out the app and go back in its still frozen! Extremely frustrating... wish this would stop!,
We love the app and my child is learning tones. There is a couple of issues with the loging in and glitching. Please fix!!!,
Touch screen response on my tablet is horrible at times. It starts to frustrate my kids,
Some activities do not work. Often freezes during activities and songs don't always play,
Not working properly. This app is pretty much useless,
Is not available on android tablet. So they play it on my phone and it kills my battery fast.,
"We have always enjoyed it on the PC, but couldn't wait for an app version. Finally it happened. It is very engaging and my girls can't get enough! Love the age appropriateness and multiple users option.",
I've been looking for this app like 4-ever. Im so xcitedto have found it.now my four yr old son can learn more while at home& vacation,

"It always crash, very poor service, I call to cancel service n I was told my monthly charge that was done today was not going to be refund it for me to enjoy this last month of service from January 21 till February 20. My last service month ended yesterday so my new one starts today I call to cancel one day late so that's why I was not going to be refund it. I don't recommend this app at all.",
"Kind of stinks we can't do any of the lessons , it keeps crashing  smh  VERY ANNOYING please fix soon!!",
My son loves it. But he's  done with level one and when it comes to the graduation part it freezes. It won't continue with any other lessons or activity. Please fix!!,
This is the best app ever...  try it then would found out.,
The TV advertisement looked more involved than actual. My two year old needs more animation and visual  like the advertisement showed. The songs should have animation to be more educational and entertaining,
Continuously crashed after selecting ANY activities.  Very disappointed. Asus Tablet,
Please make all of your other apps that are in the itunes store also available on android devices. I was very disappointed when I realized this was the only one available.,
My grandson can't get enough. So much that I brought him his own Sprout tablet to put it on.,
U can do it was a little while ago but I think you need to motivate the first one,
Hows it supposed to be free when only the first month is. Yalls commercials are a joke. I refuse to pay 7.95 a month just to keep it for my almost 2 yr old son when the advertisement on tv said free. Y'all are just a scam. Smh its a shame that I have to pay just to let my child play your app and even worse just to sign up with my debit card. Make it actually free then ill think about it.,
The kids are intrigued by the fun music. And learn new things every time.,
"Now my daughter can take it anywhere we go. She loves this, it's like a game to her but she's learning too.",
"My 3 year old loves this app. Well she did, until she accidentally uninstalled it. Reinstalled but now it won't open at all. Goes through the animation at the beginning but then says ""sorry, error, try again."" Seriously?  She's so disappointed.",
I like this things because my kids are into the Academy,
Games do not work  on Nabi. Waste of time and money. Period.,
"It is great when she can use it, but the constant freezing is nerve wrecking especially if I am driving and she can't access it!",
Won't let me log in on  tablets so that my children can use . Fix this asap! Then I will change my rating.,
"We have a subscription on my laptop, and my son loves it. Now that I can get ABC mouse on my tablet and phone, I can take it anywhere. I really appreciate it.",

I got a tablet for my son so that he can use ABC Mouse exclusively on a portable device. And now I find out that my device is not compatible with the app. They need to clearly warn us about this before we give them our credit card number. How disappointing.,
"The app is very laggy and unresponsive. Some activities do not play the correct audio, for example if you tap on a hippopotamus the audio says h is for horse. Me and my child love the website, but in its current state the app is unusable.  Nexus 7 (2013)",
"My husband and I could not be happier with our daughters progress since she started using this program. It keeps a very busy little girl engaged with fun and educational activities. It is especially helpful when we are running errands or waiting for various appointments,  After down loading the app to my iphone I decided to get a tablet for my daughter, unfortunately it was not compatable with the dell venue 8 I have had no problems with the samsung galaxy.",
I heard so much good stuff about this on TV and other outlets. Loved it at first. With every update it kept going down hill. My child no longer had interest and was wasting money and memory space to keep. Not very compatible with android. The app is completely horrible and hardly worked. Beyond disappointed especially considering it was amazing at first.,
"My daughter loves the app when it works. The main problem we have had is in the learning path when she she has tried to do a unit (usually the games) they don't always load. If they could fix this, this app would get 5 stars for sure!",
"I think the app is probably great for iphone, but not for my Samsung tablet. My 3 year old niece gets frustrated when she cannot feed her hamsters, clean the fish tank, buy new items for her room,  or have items she earned tickets for not show up in the areas they are designed for. That makes the app useless as a motivator. I have been sending emails asking for the promised upgrade, but no response. Perhaps they should get some new web techs who can figure this out.",
"I can move to different screens okay, hower there is no audio and it will not show the lessons in the learning path, aquarium is non-existant. Half of the features are not viewable. A few other bugs.  Please fix.  My son wants to play but it is not working.",
"My daughter is stuck at level 5, lesson 19 part 6. The game is non responsive and she can't move forward. Both my husband and I have tried but it is no use. The app and now our subscription are useless.",
"Love this app for my kids,  I just wish more features were available in the offline mode... i have a wifi only tablet so its Kinda useless when we are on the road on long trips when i wish they could use it :(.. other than that is a great app",
"So frusterated, I signed up for ABCmouse after hearing such wondeful things, and now I can't even access it. Both the iphone app and the android app do not work. I can't even get past the first page to log in. There should be a law that your apps actually have to function for you to be able to advertise that you have them....",
This is the best money I have spent for my children. There are countless activities and things to do on here. It is set up by age so my 2 older children have their own little people they click on for their account. They love it!,
This app is awesome. Both my 4 year old and my 1 year old enjoy it. I just wish they would be compatible with androids. I started using on my ipad and bought my daughter a Galaxy for Christmas and many of the books couldn't be loaded because of compatibility issues :-(,
I have an Acer tablet and 1\4 of the screen is cut off so you can not actually use the app,
"I was excited to see that ABC mouse has finally developed an app for mobile. However, turns out it is not compatible with all devices. The app works on my Note 4 but not my Verizon tablet. Very disappointed. Please fix the app to work on ALL mobile devices!",
"I have had this on my laptop for 9 months. Waiting for them to make an app to use on the road. I got an email this week saying they have an app. only, it won't even let me sign in.  So frustrsting!",
My daughter loves it when it works. A lot of times shen she  moves on she gets sounds overlapping  or it wont let her do what its asking.  Frustrating  to pay for something that doesnt work all the time.,
"My daughter doesnt really follow the lessons, but she loves everything.   Shes a girly girl, so the music and art is wonderful for her.",
"On the computer it is great, but on the 3 different tablets it is extremely laggy when it does work, and locks up freezing frequently forcing my daughter to start over. Tablets: ASUS Transformer Pad, Nabi II, Kindle Fire HD.",
"My daughter is 6 years old & has ""special needs"" & this site has helped her alot. She's starting to recognize words now.",
"It sometimes freezes when there's multiple things to load and the website is faster,but I'm  very happy they made a App for abc mouse thank you.",
"There are lesson icons on top of other buttons. Every time we click lesson 2, it takes us back to the prior environment.    Also it keeps popping up with a message wanting to go back to our current lesson, when we are in the current lesson.",
"My wife signed us up for this so our grand kids could use it. The app says it will work on Android 4 or better. My Galaxy note 10.1 is newer than my S3, yet it will load on the S3 and not the Note. The Note has version 4.1, so in theory it should run. The phone is much too small to use for this app. I guess once the year that we paid in advance for is up I will discontinue. They should not advertise an app they don't have.",
My daughter had huge adenoids which made it hard for her to hear and speak. She had them removed at 2 years old. However by the time she turned 3 she was still so far behind her peers. The saddest she was starting to feel it when they would ignore her. That's when we took action and bought ABCmouse. She used it for just 3 months for about 1-2 hours a day and she progressed at lightning speed. The sky is the limit with this program or in her case the solar system because she know all the planets at 3.5!,
I love this app I have a child and I was glad when I was able to put it on my phone... But I wish they would let me download it on her tablet.. We have tried and tried and still can not find it.....,
Perfect for my three year old. He loves playing the games and i don't have to remind him about his lessons because he keeps on top of them himself.,
My son loves this site/app. He has learned so much.,
"So thankful that this is finally in an app version so that. ny kids can learn on the go! 4 stars because the app doesn't allow my son to feed his pets, which he takes as a big responsibility.",
"My sisters injoys it they lovemit and also do I , even made me one it is amazing  be quiet if u don't like it keep it to yourself",
"This is an awesome way for children to learn. My granddaughter loves it,  she has so much fun learning and getting the tickets as an award, makes me want to play.",
Takes forever to load. Freezes a lot. Uninstalled and reinstalled several times and same problem. Have to keep restarting my tablet because it causes the screen to become unresponsive.,
And she's learning not just playing. List games,
My kids love it when it works. Some of the games and such will not load right or its super slow. Mostly it works good though.,
This app crashes right after I log in. It crashes on my son's kindle fire hd quite often as well. This review is from my note 3.,
Love the way my kid (he is 3 years old) can easy learn with this app and have responsibilities on daily basis as feeding his pets and organize his belongings and also a valuable teaching on how he can spend his money. I love this appüôå,
My son loves playing and going through the lessons together. Good job ABC mouse!,
This app is just like the desktop mode. Keeps my 5 year old busy for hours and the bonus is that he's learning!,
I went n bought 2 tablets just for this app for my 2 yr old twins and it doesn't work on samsung tab 4 But it waited until after I pay to tell me that!,
This is a great educational app. Our 3 year old grand daughter has learned from it. The only thing I would change is the songs . They are a bit long/boring for her.,
"My child is crazy about this program, and has made great strides in counting and color recognition at the age of two!",
"Finally my kids can play abc mouse on the tablet and my phone while we are away from home! My kids just love it, my 4 year old loves singing and listening to the stories.",
It stinks I thought  this is for learning not trying  to get my email account and password  how can you like this parints,
It's awesome to have this app on the go. My daughter can play in the middle of a store and I get done shopping faster.,
The app will not let me sign in. Not happy. You guys really should fix this problem. I really would love to let my son play this.,
"I love ABC Mouse,  but the app and the website occasionally stop working on my mobile devices.",
This works better on my and kindle than on my computer. My daughter learned to use the computer and the mouse because of this program but she likes using my kindle and never had any good activities to play on it. Now she does!,
Sometimes she has trouble with the mouse function on the computer so the touch screen on the app is awesome for her. She loves ABC Mouse and asks for it everyday!,
We love using the website and we were excited about the app. But this all changed when trying to use the app. The app has crashed 3x in 5 minutes. Once you try to relaunch the app you need to relogin.  Please fix!!,
I have this on my computer. I was excited to see that you guys have finally made an app for my android phone but it doesn't work. Please fix so I can use this wonderful program on the go with my son.,
Very disappointing. Not sure why this is so incredibly laggy.  Runs 10 times better on iPad mini.  Would love to give this a better review!,
My son is about to be 3yrs old n everyday ask if he can go to school. He loves how learning and playing on here could be so much FUN,
I cant even sign in. The keyboard comes up and half of it doesnt even work resulting in me not being able to sign in.,
It was working for few days and now there's no audio and the lessons freeze up. I'm thinking of canceling my account.,
"I love the game but better on a computer, she ends up playing the game 4 times on the tablet before she gets her tickets. I gets stuck amd laggy. Then she ends up frustrated and dont want to play anymore.",
I'm so happy they finally came out with this app! My 3 year old son loves it! He likes the app better than the site on the computer!,
Definitely worth the money.,
"Great app.  Works well but doesnt stay signed into each kids accounts.  If you sign into one child on there own device, it signs that child in on all devices.",
My daughter (3.5) loves it and has shown more interest in numbers and counting since playing the app.,
Its not working for me and its asking for email. I typed two emails I have and its not responding to any of them. Say to log in to a existing account witch I dont have any doesn't even allows for a new account.  Wast of space :( :( ^^^^,
My son has loved this since we began. His counting and spelling has improved so much within just two weeks and with his learning disability i never saw this happening. Thank you.,
This site is great! No issuesvwith it and my four year old just loves it.,
Daughter loved playing this at home n now can have it on the go,
This app really does help my 3 yr old Gracie improve eith her skills.,
"My son loves abc mouse but its really frustrating for us both when it constantly freezes, doesn't give my son his ticket for each activity and if it does its 1 -3 tickets son he gets mad when he cant afford to use them because everything cost way more than he has, or the app just won't load at all. I really hope this gets fixed!",
"Works great on the computer, app has a few issues ei the loading but at least there is one .",
"When we do errands she can not miss a beat with this app.  Thank you so much, we love it.",
Can't believe a PAID app functions so poorly on my kid's tablet.. Freezes constantly.,
After four months of use I have given up on abc mouse. They have no customer service at all. If you do get an email response from them it is only to instruct you to watch their videos but the videos are only for teachers with a class room version and not for a parent. They will keep billing your credit card long after you try to cancel.,
Works Awesome on my Samsung GALAXY Note 4 and my wife's Samsung GALAXY Avant. This app is fun as it is educational. Highly reccomended .,
I love that this is now offered on the phone!  My non verbal autistic child loves it! It's worth the money get rid of your Netflix and replace it with ABC mouse!,
My daughter has learned a lot! !,
I've always loved everything about abc mouse and now that they have an app just makes it that much better now my kids can learn anytime anywhere,
Is the best program I've seen for my son have almost 2 years using this program. Worth the money,
Im having problems with the volumen after some update???!! I was so happy for this and we can't hear anything.!! I'm paying for this program for 1 year already and happy so far and now I started using it from my phone and after the update once again:no volume,
"Still trying to get around, but child loves certain games and appears to be user friendly.",
ABC mouse has been a joy to my life. I love how it educates my child in many areas,
"I love this app mostly because my 4 yr old can't get enough of it! Makes learning fun for her, as it should be for her age.",
"I love this app , my mom buy it for me, and i can read now .",
It used to work fine on my phone and tablet but has recently stopped playing sound as well as the activities are now not responding to touch which is frustrating for both me and my daughter.,
App freezes out too much. Some function doesn't work well.,
He loves getting rewarded for each lesson he does(receiving tickets),
Our four year old loves this.  Everything has worked just fine.,
"My 4 year old granddaughter is thriving and asking to do her ""lessons""  best money spent",
"Freezing alot since the update,  and will not navigate the lessons anymore",
"Interactive, easy to navigate, fun to use and just as good as the PC version. ABC mouse is great for my learning toddler and worth the small monthly fee!",
My daughter loves the site. The app could use a few improvements though,
Well it was good but it was going to crash Riiy bad lol,
My son who is 8 have been using abc mouse for years then passed it on to his two younger sisters. So very thankful it is an app now!  Hopefully soon it will be on amazon apps for the kindle!,
My kids love it just as much as the computer.,
I don't know what we would do without this app!!  My 3 year old absolutely LOVES this!!,
We used this with my oldest grandson.  He is the best reader in his class and can figure math in his head.  He is in 1rst grade!!  And amazes people with his vocabulary and. Understanding!!  We r starting 3 more grandkids on it!!!  Best  money I've ever spent!!!  I've had it for 3 years now!!  It works great on all our equipment,
"Fix the app!! If nothing is resolved we will be deleting it..skips horribly and the audio works when it wants, doesn't give my daughter her credit as she passes a task all in all its Horrible.",
My daughter love it! She get excited!  Learn so much!  Thank you!,
Paid for a year and now after the update there is no sound and it is not working correctly.,
My son doesn't use this app & for the life of me I can't cancel. Please help!,
Absolutely love the computer version.    The ap is just as amazing!!  All 3 of my grandkids love it!,
I love it and so do my children and grandchildren. Yes!! Hallelujah! An educational app on phones for children. Yes!!,
My 6 year old loves it! Great  academic improvement,
My grandkids love this Mouse school! My 1st grade granddaughter is reading chapter books now!,
Just stopped working and I can't reopen app,
My boys love to earn points by learning and taking care of their virtual pets.,
"Works great on my Moto phone, our laptop and our tablet!",
A must have for the kids of working parents,
"My son loves playing with this, especially the songs/music.",
Why is this so difficult to install and use on a Samsung Galaxy tab 4?  It says it is installed but it won't work  -  frustrating .,
"My children are ages 7 and 5, both in 2nd grade and still love this site!",
"my 4yr old loves this!! And since they have the new mobile app, she's even more into it!!!",
I love this My little boy is Happy now learning and reading more & more every day,
Both my kids love this and ask to play it all the time!!!,
My 4 year old cant get enough,
My daughter's looovvesss ittt,
Thrilled that I can now access this site with my android,
Its been a great start to our childs education,
My son just loves learning thanks to abcmouse,
My daughter loves ABC mouse now we can use it on the go,

My nephew and nieces love to play this app it education they learn so much,
Doesn't save login some games don't work,

Our two children have really benefited from this program. We have seen a lot of progress in our 6 yr old and our 2 yr old loves to play on the program.  Our 6 yr old suffers from a cognitive delay and a speech delay. Becaus he is significantly behind this program has been very beneficial.  He loves the progam. He calls his mouse game. Our family highly recommends this program! :-D,
My son has been using ABC Mouse since he was 2 1/2. At first it seemed a little much for his age but now he is 3 and really enjoys its! I truly see successful development in his speaking and interaction with others. He will surely be ahead of the game when he enters grade school.,
"I like the app and how it teaches, but it is sloooowwww. My daughter can't do the puzzles. Other activities lock up as well. This all happens on my tablet. It works fine on my phone. Please fix. I spent $75 for the entire year and I want my daughter to be able to use it to the fullest on my tablet. Thanks",
I can't see one thing wrong with this app or ABC MOUSE. Both my daughters (4 & 2 yrs old) love spending time on here. There are so many different learning activities.,
The app is awful. My son uses this for school but he cant do anything because the app will not work properly. He can't look at his lessons that the teacher has created and it's always freezing. The concept of the app is great but useless since it doesnt actually work!!!!!!,
"App is not usable or built out. Most of the games are ""coming soon"" and the ones that are there are either not educational or so poorly built you wish they were still ""coming soon"". Sorry but im not paying 8 bucks a month for ""coming soon""",
"It well log me in, but won't let me do anything else. It gets stuck on the main screen. Please fix. This is happening on our tablet. It works great on a computer.",
This is a great app and I was excited about it until we got stuck in a game.... can't seem to move past the farm letter line for toddlers.... we've completed it multiple times.... will change rating once fixed,
Controls are horrible! My children often complain that they can't use the coloring function and the app has made my tablet crash several times. Needs major FIXES!,
"My son's kindergarten teacher uses this at school and asked the parents to use it at home. I downloaded the app, but can't open it. It's a shame because my son was really excited to use it and learn. Please fix it so it works on phones and tablets!!!! I'm sure it's a great app and I would love to give it 5 stars, but if it won't open, I can't give more than 1 star!!",
"We love the website, but the app has never let us login.",
"I love this program, but I've been having trouble logging in on the app. The website let's me log in no problem, so that leaves me to think its the app's issue. Please check it out soon! My son and I love using this app.",
My 2 year old loves this app. She's not interested in the lessons yet but I'm sure she will get there.,
We have paid for the subscription on the computer but we can't use the app on any device. The app doesn't recognize the log in and the password. Once this is fixed I will change my rating.,
The app is able to be downloaded to my phone and Samsung tablet and that's it. I cannot log in to the app so my child can use it. I changed my password three times thinking that was the issue. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice.,
Can download on my phone but not my kids tablet. About to cancel the subscription I'm becoming more and more disappointed,
Bad app for mobile phones.,
Only complaint I have so far is that it's really laggy.,
"I can sign in on the computer with my username and password but not on the app.  I have a samsung galaxy s5.  When I try signing in, it tells me my username and password is incorrect.  But my username and password combination works on the computer.  Waste of time!",
It's easy to use the tablet and play  games that actually teacher her school work. I'm using it as a home schooling assistant tool,
We want to like this app!  But it is so unresponsive on our Galaxy Kids Tab 3 that we get too frustrated and give up.  Please work on this or you may lose our money!,
"Would score higher but app doesn't work on my tablet. Doesn't recognize user name or password. What a bummer, my daughter enjoyed the site.",
Great website but it isn't supported on my phone which is where i have my son use it from. Have the app downloaded and now it isn't letting me log in even though my information is correct.,
I pay for abcmouse but cant log in on my tablet. Samsung s4 owners dont bother downloading. It wont allow u to get past the login screen and im not the only one having issues,
My daughter is really striving and learning.  I enjoy watching her bright eyes and  smiles.,
"Tried changing my password, uninstalling reinstalling, no luck. Please fix this quickly! Will only work on a computer.",
My daughter loves this app! It works better here than on my computer so it is easier for her to do stuff on her own!,
My kids are 2 and 4 and they both use the web site on my laptop to be able to have in on the tablet during long drives or doctors appointment is great !,
"It's not what I thought it would be, but it keeps my child's attention.",
"ABC mouse, loaded it and paid for a year, can't even open it,",
I have tried downloading it several times but it keeps hanging up and won't give lesson options on the learning path for my son.,
I have this app on my phone but is not compatible with my Verizon tablet. Why? It would be nice to let my toddler use the tablet instead of my phone.,
So glad they have this app. My daughter loves it!,
Both my daughters love spending time on ABC mouse and they both learn a lot from it.,
I think it's better suited for touch interface than mouse n keyboard,
My daughter loves it and learns so much!,
I love that my daughter can log on anywhere now. ..,
Great app and program.   The curriculum has a variety to keep the kids learning and entertained.,
"I will give it 5 stars when ALL the bugs are fixed..!! Its only this app. Ive done all the system updates, etc. Also, if the app could work on my tablets..!!",
My kids love it! Great on the go education app!,
"Awesome for my 4 year old, best educational app we have",
Please make it compatible with tablets!! Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 For Kids,
My boy loves this app and he's learning a lot.,
Im little im learning how to rite,
This is a great learning tool for both my 18 month old daughter and my two and a half year old son I absolutely love it and I would recommend it to everyone I know,
Best app my daughter loves it,
My 2 and 3 yr olds love it,
Slower than molasses.,
I cannot log in very very disappointing,
My son love this app,
5 Star app,
Wont play pop n peek and is hard to move anything,
"My little girl loves this app, but it logged us out and now won't let me log back in.... very upset. Please fix",
My son loves it,
My kids love ABC Mouse!!!!,
Baby loves it.,
It great!,
Love it for my son,
Wonderful learning tool for children,
Learning app,
Son likes it a lot,
Love it!!!,
üòçüòçüòçüòç,
Problems with loading,
Really do love it,
My child loves it,
Wonderful,
Great for kids,
Simply amazing,
Great games,
Awesome,
love it,
Love it,
Okay app,
I was about to cancel the membership when I see they finally offered the mobile app...after downloading I cant even log on. Might have to just cancel since I want something that we can take on the road. Hopefully they fix it soon or else I will stay with K12,
,
It's a shame how slow some of the activities load on decent hardware (Samsung Galaxy S4). Learning would be more fun for kids if they didn't wait so long for animations and for activities to load. It's not like the graphics are all that intense to warrant such slow load time.,
"It's very fun, they are actually learnig while there playing know that have the application on my phone it's easy. I have a 3 year old learning to trace,color, sing and also  learning to count and the alphabet. Thank you so much for your help:)",
My daughter. Loves this app she has it her tablet and I just installed on my phone,
Perfect to allow abc mouse to work on my sansung note8.0 tablet,
It works great as long as your internet is working,
Great app finally on mobile devices,
Love it for my kids.,
Love it for the kids,
I got this app to put on my child's tablet which is the first galaxy tab. It works well on the tab but always force closes on my galaxy note 3. Please fix!,
Android app will not let my daughter match the letters on level 5 lesson 13. She is unable to move forward on her learning path. This app is her only option for ABC mouse. If this isn't fixed QUICKLY I will be canceling my subscription!!             Update: Thanks for fixing my problem. I'm changing to 5 stars!!!,
Will not let me sign on tells me to go online to laptop or computer I don't have a laptop or computer so what do I do now this sucks my son needs this for school.,
Won't stay open to long. it Freezes up and force close every time we try to use it. Please correct the problem,
"Run very slow, when you select an answer it ask the question over and over again",
The concept is great! And when they get the bugs out it'll be worth it...but  until they can fix how slow it is and unresponsive most games are...I want my money back.,
My 3 year old had a hard time getting the games to work and navigate through.  It's too busy and hard to figure out.,
This app ran very slow and was not interesting enough to hold my 4 year olds attention.,
Will not allow me to go past the parent info. So my son can't even use it. And it says not supported from the internet! :-(,
Its forcing closed after I enter in login info press log in and it forces closed over and over. This is part of my sons schooling thats required please fix this issue,
As for now it runs perfect on my galaxy tab 2 and its almost perfect on my galazy phone. Daughter 2.5 loves it! Son 3.5 not so much.,
Abcmouse is a wonderful program! My 2 & now 5yrs toddlers really enjoy it and they are learning independently! Thankyou Abcmouse for making it affordable!,
My daycare children come in and are ready to learn & play with ABCMouse.,
My daughter loves this and it's so great to play on the computer and my phone!,
"My daughter lives this app abd so do I, endless learning",
my 2 year old son just loves this app. its great!,
My son just loves the games and I love how he actually is having fun learning!,
My kids learn a lot from this althought they like to play the games more they still get a learning activity with every game,
My daughter can't go a day without it... Love it,
An absolute must have for young children,
Please fix this please,
Great app. Thanks,
Please fix this. Am paying money for this,
Great app.,
Excellent app for my l.o.,
Pits cool,
Loved it,
Awesome,
Not free,
:(,
"My 3.5 year old just started this program on our laptop. I came to the app store to see what was available, and am extremely disappointed at the performance on Android! Many of the games lend themselves to touch screens, so this should be a no brainer. Unfortunately, we get a terribly coded app that frustrated my little one to the point of walking away. Fix the performance and this should be a 5 star review, as the laptop version is entertaining and educational!",
"We've been trying for several years now to use this app and it just never works. The PC version is fine, but the apps for the tablets and phones have consistently failed to function at the most basic level for *literally* years. My son is 7 now and we've had accounts off and on since he was 3. We kept trying every so often to see if it improved and it never does. Again, the website is fine on a PC,  but the apps are non-functional across multiple phones and tablets.",
My boys love Abc mouse on the computer. The app is to slow and they can not get into the learning path. When they try different things it takes a long time and most of the time they can't do anything. After this US fixed I'll give a higher rating.,
"Love the program but only i products can use this app. Got ipad first time because andriod couldn't use program now a year and a half later things have changed got new tab 4 and it cradhes every 5 sevonds. Works perfect on ipad and iPhone sad that I had to get ipad specifically for this program, but willing to do that again. Pleade fix andriod bevoming bigger than i products lots of unhappy customers.",
I do lots of traveling with the nabi tablet and the app works 0% of the time. my daughter gets so frustrated because this app doesn't work. Canceling service since abc mouse can't provide a good product for a monthly fee..,
"I love ABC mouse. Thing is, I am upset that I can install this on my android tablet but it goes slow then forces close. ""An error has occurred."" Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars.",
I can download it and the app either forces cm to close or never accepts my logins.  Sad bc my kid loves it,
"Like everybody else already said, on the computer is great but on the phone (galaxy s4) is so slow and frustrating neither of us want to play with it. Please fix this! We love abc mouse",
"Okay I know ABC Mouse is a great website. But why do you need membership, its like really dumb. I really need an app for my little brother to play on and so then he can learn and have a head start in preschool. I saw this app and I thought I was going to be really good, but instead you have to have a membership in order to play on it. I immediately uninstalled this game due to this tragedy.",
"Most of the games don't work on Android,  and the coloring doesn't work at all. I use it mainly for the parental stuff, my daughter doesn't even know I have it on my tablet and won't until it is fixed up.",
All it days is sorry there was an error then it boots us off. We wont keep our subscription if this isnt fixed ASAP.,
"Obviously it's the website ported to an app. It's not very touch friendly, can't remember credentials, and is a nightmare for kids to navigate. We'll be cancelling the service because the user experience is so miserable.",
"Nothing works on android app. Crashes, lessons dont work, unresponsive buttons... needs major fixing. My 3yr old is so sad",
"When it isn't crashing, the controls are really unresponsive.  On a nabi 2. Customer service is worse than the app.",
Worked for 10 minutes and then started force closing and stating there was an error. Every time we sign in it will let my kids play for a couple minutes then does the same thing.,
So far so good but I only had a few minutes to test it out.  We shall see. :) Those who are struggling with the app might be trying to use it on a device that isn't supported yet. The website is very clear that it isn't supported on all devices yet and that they are working on it. Check compatibility.,
For $8 a month this app should function perfectly. It force closes or freezes often. Most of the time I can't change colors on the coloring pages and the hamster area seems in completed. Its mostly a white screen with a few tubes connected together. This app feels more like a beta than a finished product. I hope these bugs get worked out quickly. I think my daughter would really love it if it wasent so frustrating.,
The app seems to work on my galaxy tab 2. The only thing is I wished it remember the password. I give this app 5 stars. We have a lot of learning programs and this one is the best.,
Terrible.  This needs to be fixed.  It only runs for a short time before it crashes and then you have to log back in for your child.  Please fix this!,
I did some investigating on the issues. Download the dolphin browser app and also download the flash player for it. After you do this it will run just fine,
"Have android tablet and it hardly loads anything, if at all.",
This app will not work  its amazing on a computer but its like pulling teeth by hand on my samsung tab and ipad .  Come on!!  For thr price we pay for it youd think we could get a decent app.  SO ANNOYED,
My kids love abc mouse. I'm so glad they made a phone app for it. Now they can learn every where we go :-0,
My daughter is 2 years old and she love it so much. Most specially the music and drawing,
This app is very slow and crashes often. On the laptop though this is a great program my two youngest use it. The program is worth 5 stars but the app is NOT!,
It has some bugs that need fixing...its running slow and forces u out plus it never saves the password....wish the kinks were fixed for a five star rating...,
"Does not respond well to swiping or tapping.  Frustrates my 3 year old, who is used to laptop use.",
"This is a wonderful learming program for childern in primary and elementary school. My 5 year old uses this on our laptops, and he loves it. I'm so happy to see they have an app that can be used on my tablet. Making learning fun!",
The app will allow me to sign in but an error message pops up as soon as I am at the homepage. Computer version works perfectly but I am disappointed this app doesnt.,
Thank you for fixing your app to support more devices. Works great on samsung s4,
Extremely buggy fix it ASAP! This is a paid service so this buggy app is unacceptable!,
I thought I canceled but they just took money again. I'm not happy.,
This updated app is slow and crashes often! The computer version and apple version are great but why even offer an android version that you can't use on a kids tablet?,
Freezes most of the time on mt computer and phone but my kids love it!,
Further you get the less it works! Keeps booting us off & making me re log. So frustrating. Im about ready to cancel our subscription.,
Tried the latest version; it seems to be much better than the older versions.,
"My child got a subscription through her classroom teacher.  We downloaded the app to my Samsung Galaxy S5 and any game or activity I touch has some bug.  I can't access any games or sight words.  I can only access the animals at the zoo but no games.  Not sure if there is a restriction on my access but if there is, it should have some pop-up saying so as I don't know.  Will change when some update fixes this.",
The update does the app wonder!! Good job devs.,
Love the PC version and have had no problems with android app! Happy its finally on Google play,
Can't believe how much she is learning,
My daughter has come such a long WaY in such a short time credit to this site!,
Please fix this app it keeps logging my daughter off,
My kids love it now that they can play from my phone,
I hate stupid school,
My 3 year old son is addicted.,
My son is getting trouble to do certain of the colouring and dot to dot exercises.  Am I using it the wrong way?,
My 4 yr daughter loves and mouse,
My 3 grandsons have exploded with it !!!,
Awesome app. Luv it.,
Me and my kids love this app,
Good concept if it worked.,
I use it for my 3 year old and for my students on my classroom,
It wont let me log in at all,
I think this program is terrific!,
Very nice for preschooler,
"They just need to make an app for all devices because not every parent has a computer, IPad or tablet",
Awesome,
"I love the computer version but I prefer for my daughter to use the tablet. The app sucks, it dosnt let me select the lesson its like its frozen but some other items work. Im cancellin this and finding a bettter app. Not going to pay for something that doesn't work right",
"It won't load it's clearly not designed for tablets. My  2 year old love's to pull, bite and play with the mouse.  For me tablets is the best way to go unfortunately there are to many ""bugs"".  I called  abcmouse about this problem they said  they would  call me back 2 days no call back.  I purchased  for a program that won't be provided....                 Be ware",
"App says installed and compatible with my device but there is no app loaded and when I access via web site it tells me to instsll the app.  I have Samsung galaxy s3 4.2.2, really want to use this as its easier for my daughter.",
"My son loves the app. Sometimes it messes up but very rarely. We use a galaxy s3 tab, and if it messes up its probably because you need to allow enhanced web accessibility in the accessibility part of your tablet in the settings. Since we did that no further issues! Definitely recommend this app and just like any new app it will have a few bugs. But abcmouse as a whole is awesome, great curriculum.",
"But problems exist when switching activities, they wont close properly so two different sounds/songs will be playing at same time.  Especially when she gets tickets from completing a level.",
Could install on my phone when I had android 4.3 but not on my wife's with 4.4.2.  My S4 is listed as compatible and yet it is extremely laggy.  Their only response was that ABCMouse was designed for desktops not for android.  Well that's fine and good until it gets designed for android and fails!,
You c cannot access most learning materials via the Samsung tablet and that's the electronic my 3 yr old is mostly on.,
My son love it.  He is non verbal autistic child and he started talking more now since use this app.,
"You should let people know if they have to buy anything first,  or  have to be a subscriber to anything first. Waste of time. I'm not gonna pay for something if I can only use the app version",
This app is terrible. Nothing works properly except  the songs anything that is supposed to be interactive lags horrible or just doesn't function at all. I have never had an app that was this unusable.,
Stops quite a bit through each activity.  I have restart the app and my son has to redo the activity. It'd be nice to get through something on the first try.  It works infinitely better on my ipad than son's nabi.,
Pros: range if actuvuties to keep their interest. Con: app freezes every 20 mins.,
I wish it worked better on surfaces not just androids. But my students use computers or my phone. Difficult for two yr olds to learn mouse so tablet would be best.,
App only works sometimes. It freezes a lot to where my son loses interest. Please fix this. I would like for my son to be able to use abc mouse whenever he wants from his andriod tablet.,
I have this app downloaded on my kindle fire and my galaxy tab 3 lite. It runs very slow and as many glitches on both. I often have to force close the program and restart.,
"I like the computer version, but it's easier for my 2 year old to use the tablet. She can't hit any hot keys on the tablet and my computer is set up with too many functions for her to mess with. This application isn't compatible with Android 4.4 which is the OS that most devices are getting updated to. I also tried it on an iPad and it's too small to do anything. iPad 2 has a decent screen, but was given a tiny functional user interface.  Would really like to see this available on NEWER Android OS's as well as being FULL SCREEN, not a fixed small screen that's hardly functional.",
Way too many issues. He does online .Would have loved the app had it worked.,
I'm tired of installing and uninstalling. We have a nabi not the Jr and it won't stop glitching on every game.  Please fix this.,
"I love the way this application interacts with my kids. Everyday they want to see more and learn more. It is a very nice application to reenforce and learn in a different way. However, this does not substitutes a teacher in any way.",
"Great for the first days.  My daughter  loves it.  But After a few weeks,  it crashes,  freezes or don't run.  Payed  for the whole year and can't access program to cancel and get my funds returned.  Not great for tablet.",
I downloaded this after buying a year subscription on my computer. the intro abc mouse loads and plays but after that it just goes to the yellow screen with letters on it and won't load anymore even if i refresh.  we bought my son his own tablet so he could play whenever he wanted and it won't even work!,
It is the best site for Kids to learn with. It has helped my child who was having difficulty speaking learn to talk so much better and I had her going to speech therapy and it didn't he'll like this site has.,
"Was excited to see the app FINALLY, however very disappointed that it wouldnt work on our 5 year old twins' Samsung galaxy tablets. Will not load! What a shame :(",
This is an excelent learning tool for children of any age.  It is fun and my grandaughter begs to get on.  She is well prepared to begin pre k.,
It wont show nothing than just the refresh sign. Why won't it let me use it so frustrating,
Paid for the year and not for tablets download in my Android and it runs slow and screen image is far away..olse fix..would love for my kidz to get the experience others get ..yoy make look so nice in tv....fix bugs and modify for tablets please,
Its easier for my so to use the tablet. This app doesnt do anything it freezes.,
Please fix. The application is slow and nit even available on newer tablets like the Galaxy Tab 4.,
Love the variety and awesome curriculum.  The home page gets stuck sometimes when I try to switch users.,
"One plays the computer, one plays the tablet. I like the time settings so my kids get 1 hour and then outside they go. Everyone's happy.",
First off I was charged 20.95 as soon as i signed up when first month should have been free then I cant get my money back so I'm stuck with it until December and the apo won't even download even though its showing installed its nowhere on my children's tablet,
"I purchased this for my daughters and it froze so much that they hated it in the first hour, I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it, now hope it is not a hassle to get my money back, BEWARE THIS IS NOT FOR TABLETS!! App sucks",
I wish I could Fford this.. After my husband passing my children esp. My daughter has been really lax. I know she can do the work.. Just needs to apply her lil self. She's hurtont poor baby's lost their bff & father in the same dn night,
I have a nabi and it won't let my kids trace or color please fix great app though,
No home page to switch from one child to the next. Stuck on 2yr olds page. Sucks!,
"It works...some of the time, my daughter loves it but after awhile she gets frustrated from all the glitches and finds something else. Please fix it!",
We loved the app when we purchased a subscription 2 yrs ago .... we cancelled and then now 2 years later are charged 25 a month for the past 4 months.... we didn't authorize this and we didn't use service watch out,
"Loved it before when my daughter could play on the tablet, now it won't even let me download this app. I will be cancelling my subscription.",
Use it all the time. Kids want to use it all the time,
Love this for my three year old but it  gets hung up a lot and can be slow,
I think this is a great app! I have it on my girlfriends ipad for her son! The problem that I have with it is that I found the app for andriod and I downloaded it and now I can't get  it to play on his galaxy tab 3!,
"This app is broken. Whenever I try to open it, it doesn't come up. Please fix.",
My son loves this app until it freezes and he gets frustrated and doesnt want to play any more. Please fix!!,
I've been trying to cancel our subscription for MONTHS!,
Love the laptop version but the app is quite slow and has bugs which is frustrating for my 3 yr old who does not know how to use a laptop.  Hopeful for upgrade soon,
Won't even let me long on. Come on fix this already.,
We have been using ABC mouse for a couple of months on the laptop but the app is so much easier for my kids to use. Love it!,
We kept waiting for the android app to come out and it doesn't work,
My children are learning alot thank you abc  mouse,
This app keeps freezing. My son gets frustrated with it. He can get through one thing. NONE OF THE LESSONS WORK!!!!! YOU CAN DO OTHER THINGS. But he needs his lessons,
It freezes every thirty seconds.,
My son loves this app he is learning so much so fast!,
Great app and great online learning program.  Highly recommend,
This is the  best app by far for children.  The creator of this app is a genius. Thank you for it!!!,
Teaches my child and keeps him busy with different activities that he enjoys.,
"I have this app on iOS and its amazing, unfortunately this android one barely works, it freezes, the books don't load right, zoo animals also don't load right, coloring doesn't color at all.... that's just a few I've found so far",
This is one of the best if not THE best app for kids!,
:-) I ‚ô° this app very much especially for my child,
It never lets me click on the parent section which is frustrating because I only put the app on this so I could track my sons progress easily,
freezes way too much needs work,
Need to be fixed wasting my money for nothing,
This is an amazing game for my 4 year old,
My son loves learning through this app,
Great my 2 year old son loves playing on the tablet and computer,
My kid is doing good thanks to ebc mouse,

"My 3 year old loves the website, but this app has been nothing but frustration! It freezes and nothing works when you touch something to try navigating the app. If it worked like it's supposed to it would be an easy 5 stars. Please fix it!",
"I've been waiting for this to become an android app for awhile, but it just freezes constantly. The background music continues to play through the activities. I've tried to turn off the music, but again, it freezes everytime. Super frustrating!",
So glad this is finally on here. I just showed my 3 year old and he started jumping up and down saying YAY YAY YAY! He loves ABC mouse and asks to do it every day!  I'm so proud of him!,
My daughter is stuck on lesson 6 on her learning path. It tells us to click on number 7 but number 7 nor any other numbers after that works. The app was fine until this.  Fix please.,
Moves very slow. Hard to do the exercises. Freezes up when playinf. Please fix.,
I have this on my computer and my kids love it. Now that I found it for my tablet it convenient on the go. Of course you have to have wifi or wireless Internet its great,
I love abc mouse but the app is having some issues,
Kids play it on the computer now they can play it on my phone,
Allot better than I first thought it would be.,
Wonderfully educational app for kids of all ages.,
This is great for my little one.,
I love this game,
Hop its works,
love it,
Love this,
Abc mouse,
Janiya,
Great way for my daughter to learn things and  keep her mind going while I'm running errands and getting other things done around the house. Although hands on learning with just me and her is more favorable to me because we bond and interact but this is a great app and definitely worth the monthly subscription.,
It will do this a lot it works good when its working right please fix this my son enjoy this a lot :/,
So happy to finally have an play store app (thank you).  The updates have really helped with earlier bugs and issues.  Thanks!,
Very laggy freezes and says no internet connection when there is one. Sad.,
It runs spow and repeats things,
It would be great if it actually worked at normal speed!  Its super slow and crashes!,
"Takes forever to load lessons, son loses Interest way too fast, goin to be uninstalling and cancelling account until problem is fixed!",
Awesome app ! My 5 yr olds kinderganten teacher uses this with great success!,
My son loves this program he's only 19 months old,
It's hard to keep my son off. He loves to learn!,
My 5 year old loves this app!,
This is so great,
Major loading issues!!!!!,
My kid just love it!!!!,

"My 2 year old has been working with ABC Mouse for a year now and he loves it! I am amazed at how sasy it is for him to grasp the concepts, I just have to make sure he uses my tablet cause the track pad or mouse on the computer is a bit much for him. He tries using it like a remote for the TV lol.",
"Every day my 3 yr old children ask to do their assigned lessons without being prompted its amazing! The lessons are very interactive, easy, steady paced, and my children are wowing everyone they meet because of what they are learning from ABC Mouse.",
App freezes and uploads slow. Son looses interest and does not allow me to go into my account page to cancel membership.,
Its freezes and my kid losses interest.  I shouldn't have to download an app that doesn't work.,
"I downloaded on my galaxy T3 and can't get this program to work at all.  I hope someone sees this and can tell me why.  I live the website but not the app, yet.",
I JUST downloaded this app on my S4 and I have had to reset the app 5 times and restart my phone! My daughter tries to play it freezes and she gets frustrated and loses interest.,
I'm so extremely happy there is an app now!! It makes it so easy for my daughter to play and is way more efficient than using a shock wave browser!! Thank you ABC mouse!!,
Using the app and it freezes up. Otherwise the graphics are engaging.,
Awesome,
This game really helped my younger cousins,
I swear by this,
Rubbish,
It. Is good,
I like how they use this,
Amazing,

"This app works on Galaxy tab 2 7in. My daughter will have to get used to a whole new layout.  I would definitely wait until you, the parent, has time to sit with child, (and when she is in a good mood) to walk her thru it for as long as it takes her to catch on and use it independently. My daughter in 4.",
The worst app ever. . Nothing works! ! It took me 10 minutes just to set up my son and the parents avatar profile. .I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. .All the wonderful things I've been hearing about the site are now questionable as I haven't accessed it from my pc yet.. The dates and other info that I try to enter doesn't allow me to select the correct number because the drop box disappears by the time I go to click on the right selection. .,
"Sometimes it works OK, other times it's horrible.  Either way it never really works well.  I really want to see this fixed since learning to write on a tablet is much more efficient than with a mouse.  I'll keep checking back for updates.  We love the website version.",
"I love Abc Mouse and my children does as well. However, this App will not allow me to switch users. In fact, I am booted out each time I click something. I havent been able to make it beyond the home screen.",
My kids were so into it very much. The learnings and exploring new stuffs are really a great help for parents.,
It has a lot of problems. I haven't been able to proceed past the first lesson. It takes a long time to load especially the songs. Other than that it's a Good app just need improvement.,
But app does not work. Will be forced to cancel subscription soon if not fixed.,
It freezes too much for the pretty penny that I paid.  Unexceptional! Please fix my daughter loves it and complains all the time about the freezing. She gets discouraged,
"My daughter loves it,  but you guys need to fix some bugs. It's getting annoying.",
This app is not ready there are way to many bugs. I can't even log in you guys really need to make this work. Especially when we have to pay to even use the website,
"My daughter loves this website but the app frezzes way too many times, I wish it would work better but I will keep checkingback  to see if its running better for now my daughter will still have to use my laptop",
My 2 year old is eager to learn with ABC Mouse and picked up the activities very quick.,
My daughter love this app. Really need to fix the freezing,
"It's nice program , it works very well on Apple store devices , but it is so bad and freeze here on play store ... pls fix it .",
cant get it to do anything without issues canceling the subscription,
I am loving this for my son and I to work together and learn. Love ABC mouse! :-),
Best resuts my child had. She learned her letters shapes numbers and colors.,
I recommend this for every child within the age group. The best ever,
"It is a new zpp so some bugs are expected but there are too many bugs. We dont have a computer so the app is our only option and my 2 year old daughter  runs into problems at every corner. She cant even get past the first learning destination (beach). She finished but it wouldnt let her move on. I wrote to tech support and followed their instructions but are now running into more problems.  You literally cant grt anything done without ether problems, it freezing, or it just not working at all.",
The BEST stater course for preschool n KG,
This app is the best for my 2 year old.,
I'm loven it  I'm six years old,
Love it. Easy to use.,
I thought that i can go in this app right away but i have to log in but i dont even have any log in stufff,
Love it soooo much it works for me,

"Very slow, and when you click on something it doesn't go to it. This app is very disappointi ng,  my 3 yr old daughter was very excited when we downloaded the app and once we started trying to play she said she didn't like it because it doesn't work.",
My kids are so excited to have abc mouse on their tablets! The only problems we are having is it runs a little slow at times and or freezes for a minute but other than that is great! Its new so I knew there would be a few bugs but when they are worked out it will be the best app on their tablets! And I will be able to give it 5‚òÜ,
It would be great if we could actually get to a lesson without it freezing. I think I will disable my account before any money comes out until it is fixed. No use in paying for an app that works when it wants to,
"It's nice to have an app with the full features of the website but it is glitchy & slow which is super frustrating for my kids. We also have an original ipad & prefer the larger selection of books available for ipad/iphone. Quality over quantity, I'd rather have the variety of books & smaller standalone apps if they run smoothly than a glitch full featured app. Fix the glitches (paint colors not showing/disappearing, tabs/buttons not working, etc) & it would definitely be a 5 star app. -galaxy S4",
"The nook is way more durable and kid friendly,  please make the app availa le on nook.  It currently shows that the device is not compatible",
About time u made an app for android. Some bugs to work out but other than that pretty good.,
My kids have learned so much from Abc mouse. I think it is age appropriate and is very helpful.,
So excited to finally have a app for my son and daycare kids!  A few glitches but it's understandable with a new app. Thank you for coming out with this app!,
I can't wait to teach my baby sister this stuff she's only 2 and  says a lot I think its time to up her game!,
My 2 yr old son has so much fun with this app and has learned so much! Thank you for putting this together!,
My daughter wants to play all the time and she even named her hamster!,
"Exelent learning for preschoolers and school age, they learn a lot and review what they learned.",
Great learning app for kids. I use it with the kids in my daycare.,
This program is awesome for kids!,
My family loves it.,
Thank you for put the app on the tables,
"Have downloaded and goes straight to sign in of existing acct, cannot find a place to create acct?",
Glad to have an app now.,
Says we are not online... We are however connected....,
Very poor app. have downloaded it and reinstalled several time but still won't let you let you click on buttons to advance to next levels?,

This app encourages my child to do more lessions but it has so many issues. When it comes to coloring it almost never fill in the colors. Im trying to do the lessions with my boy this morning and cant move on because the read to me book is not working. I expect better from this app since I pay for the abcmouse subscription.,
I complained because coloring wasnt working. Yesterday he got to level 1 lesson 36 a book on the tortoise and hare and that book will not play he cant move on to the next lesson until he does this one. Ive updted the app and it still doesnt work. Update 3/24/14 App isstil getting stuck and will not color. Please fix this.,
It no longer works I just had it for 3 days and it all blank. Waisted my time so disappointed.,
Works half the time. Cannot move on to the next lesson and keeps getting stuck. Have a samsung galaxy 3 tablet. A big disappointment.,
"The games are fine but barely work, and then trying to cancel the subscription is impossible since you have to do it through the app. Definitely not worth the money or frustration of both parent and child.",
Lots of glitches. Read to me nursery rhymes do not play. The coloring pages freeze and do not color. And no pet park.,
This is my son favorite. He has learned and now is so much ahead of where hes supposed to be. Thank you guys.,
It a good game for my kids but I have problems  changing from one child to the other and sometimes some of the games don't work please fix this I'm paying money for it it shouldn't be acting like this,
It freezes a lot and half the games dont work right,
Won't go into the next level keeps getting stuck! Videos have no picture.  I have a Sony z1 should work no problem!,
Helped my three year old and my eight year old who has trouble  learning in school ! ABC mouse.,
I can't download it in my tablet Samsung Note2.  Disappointed.,
My kids love this app so kuch they ask for it by name!,
Best app ever my 2 year old loves it!!!,
I can find app on smart phone but not on tablet,
Excellent games for all small children!,
Needs more improvement! -samsung galaxy tab2,
My kids adore this site,
None of the books works and closes website in the middle.,
My daughter loves this!,
Excellent,
Won't load at all,

"I'm so glad they finally made the app for my phone and my child's tablet, been waiting for it couldn't take advantage of it due to work so my kids had to wait for my laptop to be available but now they can use it freely on my phone or tablet while on the go. Thanks abcmouse I'm looking forward to renewing the subscription.  Real helped my son now he's ready for kinder",
Great app.  Needs a little refinement.  Runs a little slow on the galaxy tab kids. Lessons involving coloring are frustrating with a small screen.,
I downloaded it but it keeps  telling me to enter email  a  password but It won't let me set up account on here n I would really love for my daughter to learn n I cant with this app cuz it won't let me do it so how do I get an account set up for this app,
So glad that they finally got this up and running. Now my 6 year old can do her activities on my tablet while my oldest does his work on the lap top,
They dont even realize how much they are learning. I appreciate the learning paths and the structure it provides.,
"Love this app and so do all of my boys age 3, 6, and 7.",
Love it! So excited there is an android app now! Thank you so much!,
Its the best apps for all the toddlers!,
My grandson loves this app,
Kid's love it!,

"Over priced and can't do much offline. It might be over wellmune for some kids, there's too much. It wasn't challenging for my 4 year all he had to do stuff he already knew to get to the harder stuff for him, he lost interest fast. I tried cancelling and they are still charging me and it's been over a year now. I also tried to reset my password but their website keeps going in a loop where it's trying to get me to download the app and there's no phone number just a AI chat support that sucks.",
"Connected to Spectrum TV AT@T user friendly probably on Robin Katz phone Son Joshua Paul Katz,@108 Richardson Rd Hollis NH has access to Same address as Kenneth Colassi internet service For this Device FOR Xfinity Comcast and Robin Katz wifi hotspot For Gwen Anthony Internet access",
"The content of abc mouse is not nearly challenging enough.  My 7 year old was not excited about it.  We hadn't used it in over 6 months and they auto renewed my account, refused to refund me when I immediately canceled.  Make sure you read the fine print with this company as they lack ethics when it comes to customers and doing what is morally correct.",
My daughter barely played this before it became monotonously boring to her. The app was forgotten about until I found an auto renew charge on my account. Please don't forget to cancel this before they auto renew your subscription. Any contact I attempted with the company was ignored. No customer service and content wasn't sufficient to actually spend money on. Thoroughly disappointed to say the least.,
"ABC MOUSE charged my card 20 times in a row immediately AFTER I canceled my free 30 day trial. I still had 28 days to try the app but we no longer needed it. DO NOT PURCHASE this app they will overcharge you and claim that you owe them. Customer service is a joke, almost nonexistent. Overall a huge waste of money.",
I paid for this app for my son for a full year and can barely use it It doesn't open half the time it's very very slow going from one letter to the next. My toddler gets fed up waiting for it to load and for something to happen  Please fix bugs soon,
"Just started this software, still waiting to see results. Had same issues with app being unresponsive that a lot of people seem to be having.  Uninstalled and reinstalled while waiting for customer service, seems to be working on my galaxy 5 now, haven't tried it on his Nabi.  Still have a couple weeks to cancel before paying anything if this continues.",
"1 month free trial but you have to give your card details up front and they don't mention the monthly costs if you don't like it but forget to unsubscribe, just another app looking for $$   Let people try the lame app THEN decide if they want to subscribe! No.. because they know people won't..not worth it, honest apps don't trick people.",
My kids love ABCMouse. Its fun and educational but the app does shut itself off a lot in the middle of an activity. The android app could definitely be stronger. Not sure why this happens. I have a brand new GPad from LG on Verizon. Happens both when using the Verizon network and at home using wifi. If the app was more stable it would be 5 stars.,
This app is so boring for me 3 year old that he went on his tablet and removed it. The graphics are the worst. And it's ridiculous all the steps you have to go through just to log in. Why not have some of the people that are not satisfied in the commercials just to be fair so that people can make an informed decision.,
"I signed up for the 30 day free trial. And got charged right away anyway. The site looks outdated and the things we tried were simple and boring. My son was excited to try it out but ended up disliking. Don't waste your time, it's really not worth it.",
"I've emailed them 4 months in a row about cancelling they keep taking money out of my account. I am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau. Also, there is no number to call, you should never do business with an organization you can't call at anytime concerning the product and it's billing practices. Also, will let my kids school know as they have this site listed as one for the kids to use Rip off and Scam.",
"I was hoping this was a great reading tool for my son with Dyslexia. I 
found out quickly that when he ""read"" the books, he was really fast 
forwarding through them and it was giving him credit for reading the book. 
So there is not way to be sure he truly read anything. There is no small 
assessment at the end of each book either. If you have a smart child who 
knows how to cheat the system this app is not for you.",
I'm sure this is a wonderful site but it did me no good do to it only goes to the first grade and my kids are beyond that. I paid for something I can't even use and they don't give refunds no one has money to throw away. I know I don't I work hard for my money. I thought I wouldn't be billed until after my free trial boy was I wrong. I'll be disputing the charge I'm not paying for something I can't use.,
My 4 year old has been playing this on the computer and loves it . I have been waiting for the droid version and now downloaded it . My son loves abc mouse. But for some reason on the tab. It keeps freezing and making the screen go black ..other than that we love abc mouse,
The website didn't warn me that my tablet wasn't compatible but took my money anyway. They do not make it easy to cancel. You can't access anything through their website.  I had to wait until I had access to an android phone 2 billing cycles later in order to cancel and they don't issue refunds.  Completely sketchy company and horrible to nonexistent customer service.,
This app was too complicated for my son and daughter and they billed me for the subscription even after I had canceled it and has caused me a ton of overdraft fees and problems and I've tried to contact customer service and all you can do is leave them an email and wait for the to get back to you...... And still haven't heard from them üòû,
My husband and I got this app on our tablet for our daughter who loves it. We had to factory reset it though and since it won't even show up in Google Playstore to redownload. It shows up when I search for it on my phone but not tablet. Our daughter now has no way of playing and asks constantly for it. Very disappointing and aggravating.,
"Garbage! Not only does it freeze, but it takes forever to load. When it does load the games/ learning is so juvenile, my 7 year old lost interest in about 3 minutes. What's up with the 8 pages of ""No thank-you"" and please buy more junk at the beginning? and... to cancel you must go through the same 8 pages of ""are you sure that you want to cancel"" nonsense ! what a complete wasteof time and money. Unless your child has never gone to school, this APP is nothing more than a scam.",
"I love and mouse, both my kids love it, but they can not have it on their own tablets. I have 7 android devices and out of the 7 only 1 is capable of having the app or playing abc mouse. My kids have a much harder time with the computer and my phone, which I use for business, is all that works so they are not getting to use abc mouse as much as I or they would like. Please add more android support!!",
Ever since I found out ABC Mouse has been charging my card for something my child don't even use  it ask for my banking information again to reactivate it but I get charged on the 11 every month... how can I stop these charges. This is not fair it shouldn't charge your card if you haven't been get in to the account for nearly a year.,
Beware of special offers. Recent presidents day 50% upgrade failed with attempts through horrible website no response. I cancelled subscription and received NO explanation from their customer service. Sad because my grandkids love the program. I just don't trust robots running the show.,
"Hated it, because I subscribed abc mouse for my grand daughter, she had a little 30 day trial period, and she could never get the learning games to start. And they still debit my account 7.95 each month and she can never use it. It a scam to get peoples money. A legitimate company would have a customer service department and a phone number to reach them. I try to cancel by texting them but they are still taking my money. The only way to stop them from automatic debit is to, cancel my debit card and get a new one. A inconvenience  for me. I will nver recommend them to anyone",
"If you sign up for ABC Mouse, plan to be tricked into purchasing another subscription. There is a section at the end of the very long ""Terms and Conditions"" that gives ABC Mouse the right to automatically charge your credit card for another subscription unless you cancel at least the day before it is scheduled to expire. I guess that's the only way for the company to keep their program going is to be deceiptful and not straightforward with their billing practices.  Good luck.",
"I've tried repeatedly for the past 20 minutes to find a cancel option on the website. Finally had to Google search to get to the customer service page. When you think you find where to go to cancel the account you have to flip through 10 pages of their other programs before you can finally say,  screw off and let me cancel. Then it dumps you right back out to the logged in home page. Thank you to the annoying crooks who designed this.",
"It was really fun for my 4 year old at first, but after a while it just got 
so dang boring. He basically did the same thing over and over till the 
point where he hated it, I would say let's play and mouse and he would No I 
I DONT LIKE THAT GAME, IT BORING plz make it more fun",
"I used this program for a year, cancelled and requested not to be billed once my year was up. to my surprise a year after I cancelled I get a $50+ charge on my account. I never submitted, completely unauthorized. the whole ABC mouse program is mediocre. children can do the same stuff on their own. with books, crafts, music. very unethical practices, to illegally charge ex-clients without permission.  I wonder how many people don't even notice. shame on you ABC mouse. buyer beware.",
"I used to have ABC mouse before the app but my kids couldn't figure out the mouse. When I saw they came out with the app, I downloaded it and signed in. I was about to reactivate my subscription when it froze. I tried closing it and it made my screen go black. I couldn't turn my phone off or do anything it was THAT crashed. I started to panic. Finally it shut off after trying for 5 minutes. When I got it turned back on, I IMMEDIATELY deleted it off of my phone. So glad I didn't pay yet!!",
"It would be a nice app if members are able to login on tablet.  I can login from my browser , but unable to login from my Google Tablet.  I have tried to uninstall and reinstall multiple times.  The online computer browser one is excellent for my child to play on my computer.  Please fix login issue so that it can be portable too.",
"Play store says it's #3 free education app... Nothing about this is free. In order to do free trial, you still have to enter in credit card info. At $9.95+++/month, it doesn't sound very free to me. I have no problem with paying for apps, but $10/month or more is a lot for an app that my baby is still quite young to grasp (she's only a year). I just don't like how it's claiming to be to be a free app but they don't even have one thing you can do once in the app itself without paying for.",
"How the hell do you cancel it? We signed up for the free trial my 3 year 
old tried it for 10 minutes and hated it, we never logged into it again. 
And I just realised it's been taking 10 dollars out of my account for over 
a year! What a big waste of money!",
It was okay at first for my 4 and 5 year old but they got board of it fast. I would say this app is for 3 under or a child that can not read or write . Then the biggeat problem is you ask them to cancel and they keep taking your money.,
"I love this app! The only issue I've run into is changing the avatar over to a boy from a girl for my son.  But the lessons are great, the cartoons are adorable and it keeps my son entertained (which is hard to do unless it involves ps4 video games). I love that it makes him show interest in education.",
We got it to see if it was any good because of all the commercials and it wasn't anything like the commercials.  I also wouldn't get it.  I did the subscription and I cancelled it because i didn't like it and my kids hated it.  I was charged even though the app said I cancelled it and now they are saying they have no record of that and they have charged me.  Never again and I will not be sending anyone to ABC mouse.,
"You are the commercials and say ""yeah ok another app to make you think your child is going to learn something"". Let me tell you our son was 2 when we got the app and he is 7 now. Top reader in his kindergarten 1st and we are looking to see the results for second grade. When he was in pre school he had shocked us by reading at I believe it was 2 1/2 years old. We was told he is on the autism spectrum since he was 2 years old but thank you and mouse for finding that loving to learn bug in him.",
"The learning academy is great, I really like it but the app is awful. It it horrible on my ipad but even worse on my cell phone (samsung galaxy note 4 ) The website is fine on a computer but the app is super slow, frequently crashes and is just frustrating",
"This app is complete trash! My 5 year old son is going turning into bipolar 
because he can't play. I paid for a year subscription for what? All I'm 
getting out of this is a huge head ache and a waste of my hard earned 
money. Don't waste your money on this. Instead buy games to play with your 
kid. Abcmouse app is trash. I regret ever downloading let allow paying over 
$100 for a year subscription. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE",
Ive sent multiple emails about cancelling my service. Ive called a dozen times  trying to get a call back because my card continues tonget charged and i havent used your app in well over 3 months! Im very displeased and soon plan to file charges if i dont recieve a phone call back by tomorrow morning!,
"I downloaded the app because it said Free. You have to sign up, get the first month free, and then pay $7.95 a month. I tried it once for my daughter, and she only liked the zoo & farm sections. If you don't have a touch-screen it isn't as easy. She hated trying to ""write"" her letters using the mouse (I bought a mouse for her to use on my laptop because her school also doesn't have touch screens). She liked building the hamster habitat & her ""room"".",
"But they get impatient when the games or stories take too long to load.  I don't want to buy this membership if each game is a hit or miss with loading.  Even I get annoyed when I click on a game and i just see the loading logo just moving (longest wait is 5 mins).  I have it downloaded on my samsung tablet.  Would also love if this could go up to higher grades, like 2nd grade.  My daughter likes learning.",
"Dont really understand why you have to pay to help your child learn, going with the other 1000's of apps that are free even after a month. Some people are poor you know an if it's constantly not working people really an you paid for it... JUST SAYING",
I got this to help prep my son for kindergarten but he HATED it so we never really used it.  His school provides a better option anyway once he started.  They were not supposed to charge my card again but sure enough they took another $60 a year later.,
App keeps kicking user out of the program returning student to the welcome screen.  Running on an android tablet purchased so child could use the app. So far extremely disappointed in the app. Please fix the app snaffu so we can get learning back underway.,
"Both my children love this program. They are 4 and 3 and can tell me so many fun facts and things they have learned already using this program for only 6 months. There are many different techniques used to teach children such as: videos, books, coloring pictures, games, puzzles and tracing- EVERY child is sure to learn with this method! Definitely recommend this product and will continue to subscribe until both children are in the dreaded public school system.",
"Not kid tested. I was a preschool/kindergarten student a long long time ago, but I do have a degree in education, so this review is based on usage by an adult for whatever that is worth. Program is expensive and I still have not decided if really worth the extra costs. A monthy subscription fee of $11 is pretty hefty if you sign up for assessments and access to classroom. I think they make a good effort to be multi-cultural and provide various learning methods.  Songs and reading really fun and educational.",
"Worst rip off ever! Program does not work on ANY browser or device. freezes up and will not let my 2 sons progress. Sends them on endless loops doing the same lame coloring assignment. After only a few frustrating hours of having it. I cancelled. No refunds! I would not trust them with your payment  info either. Many people report still being charged after cancelling. Closed my Paypal too, just in case. I would never recommend this app or this program  to anyone!",
"This app is malfunctioning therefore it should not be made available especially if fees will be incurred  by potential customers. I had difficulties setting up my kids profile and once I was done getting annoyed with the setup, I discovered that almost every game was unresponsive. This left my child frustrated. I will be canceling my free trial  membership and red flagging it to Mastercard. It's just unacceptable. Fix your app before asking for any fees!",
It was cool until i noticed theyre charging me 3 times a month and i cant call and talk to anyone... I emailed and they want me to send my card info via chat... Not acceptable... Now i have to order a whole new card.,
"Don't get me wrong I looove abcmouse I have used it in my homeschool curriculum from its beginning.  This app suucks on my phone it is perpetually stalled, nothing works as it should so I uninstalled the worst part is. I pay for abcmouse, but because my computer is broken I downloaded the app and I can't use it!! So again love the program but hate the app.",
Offered a 7 day free trial subscription but charged me $19 & some change immediately. Refused to refund my money the next day. Horrible customer service! Told me there's 2 different charges? False advertising I screenshot everything & sent it to them & still no refund & now no membership?  Although I think ABC  mouse suck's  & I don't want it anyways!  That's the whole point of trying it out first with free trials.,
"It DID NOT get my daughter's attention AT ALL. I signed up for a free subscription.  Later I realized it was a waste. I cancelled my subscription and deleted the app. It has been a couple weeks since my cancellation and they charged my card. I have sent an email questioning the transaction and requesting my money back. However, I have not received a response.  DO NOT TRUST!!!",
I signed up for a free trial and had to enter my card number.... They billed me anyway! And to top it all off THE GAME ARE BORING. THE GRAPHICS ARE LOW QUALITY AND REPETITIVE WITH POOR SELECTION. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER. THERE WAS NO SUPPORT TO DEAL WITH BEING UNABLE TO ACTIVATE PARENTAL CONTROLS. PURE GARBAGE.,
"What is going on with the app? I paid for a year subscription and dont plan on cancelling. It doesnt matter if its on my phone or his tablet it freezes, shuts down, he will complete a task and the mouse with the tickets wont come out or anything and will still say he never completed the task. Its very frustrating. We didnt have this problem in the beginning. Please I hope this gets fixed soon. The very slow loading to the classroom, the white screens etc. I sincerely hope its being addressed.",
We have no PC in our home and the site accessed via a tablet tells you to install app to purchase but I've been unable to fimd anything about buying. Hate being forced into installing an app to do something specific but being unable to do what it says we should!,
Iam trying to cancel the 7 day trial offer but you have to download the entire app which my phone warns me is a VERY LARGE APP AND I MIGHT INCURE EXTRA CHARGES ON MY  PHONE BILL. I Dont have near enough storage TO even download IT  on my phone!! Its very frustrating. Ive NEVER HAD TO DOWNLOAD ANY OTHER APP TO CANCEL ANYTHING. THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND INTENTIONAL. SHAME ON YOU. I WILL CALL OR WRITE THE COMPANY TO CANCEL THE TRIAL OFFER.UGH!!,
"I am not a parent but I do babysit my 4 year old brother, while I babysit 
him he always used to just watch the TV but I wanted him to learn instead. 
So I downloaded ABC mouse hoping that he would learn how to read and write 
his name, and parents or siblings also need to understand that each child 
learns in different ways and if u want it to work u should guide them. I 
make my brother use this app almost everyday and he is learning so much, 
than before, thanks ABC mouse",
"I Love ABCmouse, They helped My Children, when school failed my Special Son, ABCMOUSE did Not, then I found Arkansas Connections Academy between them ABCmouse they are wonderful, now they are older, I wish ABCmouse went to 6th grade. We use Reading Eggs also since seizures mess with my Special Son. They are Great, They helped when everyone else gave up on my Son's.",
"Read the reviews online, not the ones on the play store! Very hard to cancel and will bill you anyway. The website is very difficult to navigate and crashes across multiple devices. Kids don't need this at an early age, they need to read books. This will only make them less intelligent and shorten their attention spans.  Unless you want your child to be a mindless screen junkie, please stay away!",
"Imagine as an adult wanting to supplement your education by taking an extra math course. The first 4 weeks consist of the basics of addition and subtraction. That's what this program is similar too, it assumes, based on age, every child has progressed only to a certain level. There are several improvements which can be made but the first should be an introductory course to match individual child's level of understanding to relevent and challenging content which pushes as well as affirms successful progress. Also, this app fails to allow access across platforms, you sign up on iOS and need to cancel via iOS, you won't be able to log in via web browsers to cancel the account. I'm sure this app can be useful, but I think the ""success"" stories seen on TV and arguably in these reviews about kids loving the app is derived more from the ability to spend time on a fancy electronic device and the colorful, multiple items to interact with rather than building and supporting an enjoyment for learning school work. This is an app for kids who might fall behind in their schoolwork to allow reinforcement of material they might struggle with rather than a kid who is, according to this app, much more advanced than the ""typical"" or ""general"" whatever age group they fall in. To rebrand the quote in the above picture ""accelerates growth away from literacy and math afterschool tutor bills"".",
"I tried to download but it won't load fast enough to do so, mean while I 
was reading all the reviews as my son is about to be 3 in September and is 
already in early intervention and a teacher from headstart also comes out 
to teach him and his one year old baby sister anyways, he already has a 
hard time sitting still for five minutes at a time to learn anything and 
has a communication delay right now as well, the loading issue would 
frustrate him really bad, also I'm not downloading it or trying the free 
trial subscription either bcuz I'm not taking money away from my children 
just for a stupid app that obviously has all kinds of errors and loading 
issues and won't let you unsubscribe and steals your money, money to which 
we could pay for other ways of education for them that actually works the 
way it's meant to work! So SORRY BUT NOT SORRY I WON'T BE DOWNLOADING YOUR 
B**L S**T APP AND WASTING MY CHILDREN'S TIME AND MONEY! THIS APP AND 
CORPORATION ISN'T TAKING MY CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL FUNDS FROM THEM AND 
GIVING THEM NOTHING IN RETURN! A BIG THANKS FOR THE PARENTS THAT HAPPEN TO 
TELL EVERY ONE EXACTLY WHAT THIS APP WAS DOING TO US! AND I DON'T SHARE 
NONE OF THE INFORMATION THIS APP WAS ASKING FOR TO ANYONE!!!! INVASION OF 
PRIVACY IS RIGHT GUYS AND ITS ALSO ILLEGAL TO KEEP A PERSONS DEBIT CARD ON 
FILE AFTER THEY HAVE ENDED THEIR SUBSCRIPTION AND KEEP CHARGING THEM FOR AN 
ACCOUNT THEY NO LONGER USE THIS SITE IS LUCKY THEY HAVEN'T HAD A LAWSUIT 
FILED AGAINST THEM YET!!!???ü§îüôÑüòíüò°üò†üò§üëéüëéüëäüëä SHAME ON YOU FOR USING 
CHILDREN, PROMISING THEM SOMETHING FUN AND NOT DOING IT JUST SO YOU CAN 
MAKE EXTRA MONEY! FIR SHAME!!!!",
"They just charged me well over a year after my last membership and overdrafted my bank account when I called expecting them to take care of this , as I have been a loyal customer for years,  they told me too bad and were rude!  They just stole 102 from me!!  And have completely screwed up my family s finances this month!  How can you care about kids when my kids are going to have a rough week now!  This company has no morals and doesn't care about children!",
My children love this website so I got the app it worked great for a few days and now it won't allow me to switch users and it takes FOREVER for anything to load. But the number one issue is being unable to change between users,
"All the educational stuff is great, but the AI crashes and freezes all the time. My son was trying to read a book, where it would highlight the words for him, but the pages wouldn't turn. When the book was finished the app just turned off, not even acknowledging that it crashed",
"In an age where we know so much about the importance of learning & early education, those who seek that knowledge or need it should be granted access to those resources. Shows that were freely available to kids for decades, like Sesame Street, are being ripped away to subscription channels & turned from a public service into a profit-making racket. ABC Mouse is just a new player to this game, out to utilize your kids to make a buck. Teach them the old-fashioned way & save some money.",
My son will be two in the next couple of months so he is kind of interested in this app. He enjoys the theater the most . When he sees the tablet he is excited to see the home screen but his impatience gets the best of him.,
"Definitely not Impressed.  User interface is not kid friendly at all.  Expected a lot more content for something that has a monthly fee.  Also,  my previous review was deleted!  So you lost another star because of your manipulation of reviews.  I reported you for this already.  I'm saving screen shots from now on.  Anyone else do the same and see for yourself.",
"I don't usually write app reviews but this one deserves a negative rating! For as much as this company pays for advertising, you'd think they  would fix all the glitches. I used this app on both my Samsung Galaxy and on the PC and it has crashed consistently on both. That means my 3 year old gets equally frustrated and not willing to use the program. As an alternative, I recommend downloading Starfall. The ABC app of Starfall is free but the full price version is definitely worth it!",
"This company is NOT BBB (Better Business Bureau) accredited! Due to them double and triple charging, not being able to cancel the free trial, and they will not answer the phone when you call to get your money back or get your free trial cancelled. I have screenshots of the payments still being taken out of our account, even after we cancelled. FRAUD! In total they have taken over $40 from our account. I will be going to the propee authorities and/or Class Action Lawsuit.",
It was a good app for education. My daughter loved to get on it. We got a free account from her daycare. So I decided to cancel the subscription and it was a pain.it was hard to find anyway to cancel it. Then if you want to cancel you have to go under the app I couldn't do it from the website on my phone.,
"Download app with the 30 day free trial. Tried to open an couldn't. Got as 
far as parents sign up an couldn't go any further. Then tried to cancel 
subscription an there is no way to do so because you have to do so through 
account settings. That you can not assess because you can't get any further 
then parent set up. Tried to call customer service but there's no number. 
Tried to contact through app no response.",
"My son is 4 and has never been to preschool or headstart and he has learned more than my own kids that have went. And I don't know how to explain how much this means to me that he has learned so much from one little app, he picked it up right away. Thank you so much !",
"They say it is free and I was excited because my daughter loves ABCmouse on t.v. but once you download the app it tells you that the first 30 days are free and then you have to pay a monthly subscription fee. Dissapointing, couldn't you just be happy that you are educating young minds througha convenient app without trying to bleed their parents pockets. Tsk tsk.",
"The app will not give my child her hard earned tickets. After finishing puzzles, and after reading books, the app will pause. Forcing her to redo her hard work, or making her move to the next activity, unrewarded. My daughter is 7 years old and struggling in some subjects in her school. She does not need Any extra frustration, nor any disappointment. Please Fix These issues. I'm Not going to pay, for my daughter to be unhappy!",
Got this last year and have been paying a whole year cause I figured it must just be glitchy because it was new. Boy was I wrong. This app whether on a tablet phone or even a regular computer is so slow it constantly makes my daughter upset because it is like 10 steps behind her trying to catch up but just freezes there for a few minutes before doing anything. Extremely frustrating. Cancelling our membership.,
"There are so many competing apps out there. This one is not worth your time. It's very slow and buggy for something very expensive. Not to mention the aggressive push for their other paid services and hidden and lengthy cancellation process (with more aggressive push to their other products). It's basically an ad platform for their company. Cancellation was a pain. Had to talk to rep many times after they try to keep charging me after cancellation. Very dishonest. Had to ask credit card company to intervene. The content is decent, but again there are many apps out there and this one is just not worth your time, pain, and stress. Check their BBB, they have a history of this practice.",
"This only works if you're planning on using it along side your child, or if your child can already read worthout help. Before my subscription was over,  I was going to cancel my account.  A screen popped up that offered a year subscription for $29.95. I click on the words, ""learn more"". The next screen showed my account upgraded already and I was immediately billed.  I contacted customer service and requested a refund and asked that my account be closed.  They refused- poor customer service",
"Start all was recommended by my child's teacher.  However, most of the content is only available with a paid membership.  I wanted to have something to keep sight words and simple math fresh during vacation, but kind of hard when not even the entire alphabet is included.",
"Garbage. And if you sign up for the free trial, make sure you cancel before 
they charge you for months on end with zero correspondence otherwise.",
"I cant get thru the registration for my daughter. I can type her name in but it when I select her birthday, it pops up but when I select the month it won't do anything. I'm using the app and it sucks really on registration. Actually the whole registration things sucks because it freezes and moves slow. I don't understand why you can't just do it on the regular website and just link the account to the mobile app. I'm trying this one last time. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled. It did the parent portion better but same issues for child portion. I read other reviews with people saying it's better with the tablet so I will give this a shot.",
but on my Android it is slow and frustrating for my 3yr old. He keeps telling me my phone is broken and won't even play on it anymore. But the laptop is awesome he loves it and so do I. He has surpassed his peers until I told the daycare about abc mouse. And since she has been using it all of my sons classmates are above average with everything. AND THEY ATE HAVING A BALL. .,
"Can only give one star.  Would give less if I could. Charged me when it said it wouldn't, and now I've been trying for an hour to cancel it without installing the app,  but it's forcing me to, very pissy user features and links.  Nothing's done very well.  Super unsatisfied.",
"I did the 30 day free trial, my child wasn't interested so I deleted my account (or thought I did) before the 30 days were up. I was charged anyways for another month, which over drafted my account, which I now have to pay $37 on top of the monthly fee.",
ABC MOUSE IS A SCAM. THEY CHARGE YOU TWICE A MONTH EVEN AFTER YOU CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP. Customer service is also a scam they play a recording for an hour straight or longer and claim theyre too busy to answer.,
"There's a glitch in the app in one of the games that turns the game off and 
the student can't move forward on their learning path. They said they 
couldn't do anything. Its a bug in their own system! They should be able to 
fix that. We had to quit using abcmouse since it no longer works.",
I have used this app for my kids and they loved it. But since the last update we haven't been able to do much. It keeps logging us out. Tried multiple Tablets and phones. Please fix asap.,
Terrible customer support for this poor quality app. Nick jr should not advertise such pathetic apps.,
"It does not send me a link to reset my account password. Which means I cannot view my settimgs, or even worse, if I get logged out my daught cannot use the app and I get charged for usage anyway. I would like to cancel my account.",
ABC Mouse has been instrumental in getting my grandson ready for kindergarten. He has learned so much in the short time we have had it for him. I am impressed.,
It sucks now. Takes forever to load and does not let the child complete the lesson. Constantly freezing. Here racking. Should have worked on new tablet static but it does not will be cancelling,
They treat children like they are dumb and it doesn't help them learn it kills there self esteem.,
It always freezes in the middle of an activity. Many of the interactive sections do not function which just frustrated my child and she didn't want to use it.,
"It's bad enough the app won't open after the initial download, but it also keeps everything else on my tablet from opening.  I've reinstalled twice, but it happens every time.  I end up restarting my tablet.  And when I uninstall the app, everything is fine again.",
I don't know what update/change was made but this is horrible.Keeps saying error occurred when I try to open the app,
Had it for less than a week and my 3 year old is already adding. I couldn't be happier with the purchase of abc mouse,
To pricy takes money out even if you omnly want the 7$. Plus you can onlypay for monthly or a year. Faluse advertising scam artists. I wouldnt get it for nobody not even my child. Thanks for nothing you should report this site and take it down,
My kids love ABC mouse. They think its only a game but they don't even know how much they are learning. Its wonderful.,
I uninstalled and even though its gone when my kids open kids mode its still there for them to reinstall  without permission.... i cant take it off ....its annoying,
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR A TRIAL IT'S A SCAM. It was understimulating for my 
child, I couldn't move past the level. They don't list their customer 
service number anywhere. I had to get it from my bank. They said they took 
ir down because children would call... which seems like a weak excuse to 
make them unaccesable and continue to charge. The app takes up too much 
space and will in time it will malfunction. I wound up paying $60 by June 
in 2018. I threatened to file a claim with the fcc and they gave me $40 
Ugh! The EMAILS! GOOD GOD! So many emails. There's no shortage of programs 
like this, do not sign up for this one just because it's on TV. If you want 
your child to excel take them to the library. Read out loud. Get a chalk 
board. Make learning fun.",
"I have to agree with all the one stars. They take your money right away and do not give you your free month like they promise. I wanted and hoped to try the 12 month subscription, but I guess it didn't work out and they charged my card twice. My son just didn't like abcmouse, even though I told him it will help him for pre-k. He didn't care, he said delete it. I requested my money back because I cancelled the next day. I don't know if other people were able to get a refund back, I hope I do! There are a lot of free apps out there or even videos on YouTube that are free and are just as good if not better than this app. I encourage people to look into those first, so your not getting ripped off by their promises they cannot keep!",
Do not download this the app does not work and then they micro charge you when you cancel. Also you can not reach a human when you try to dispute this. I'm so frustrated.,
"I tried to cancel my kiddos account months ago, received a cancellation 
confirmation and yet they are still charging me. Not impressed.",
"STOP TAKING MONEY OFF MY CREDIT CARD! I'VE CALL YOUR COMPANY 3 TIMES. THAT'S FRAUD! I'M CALLING MY BANK. WE HAVE CANCELLED 3 TIMES AND YOU WON'T STOP RIPPING ME OFF! STOP FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! GUYS, WHO EVER IS READING THIS. DON'T PAY FOR ANYTHING ON THIS APP! THEY WILL NOT STOP CHARGING YOU EVEN AFTER YOU CANCEL IT!",
I don't have a credit card this is the only methods of my child's learning before school,
This app is boring my son don't like it because you have to put your email in and you have to pay I thought it was free,
"My 7yr old has loved it for the passed few years online and my 2yr old loves it as the app. Only bad thing is if you are pushing buttons to fast on some games, it will freeze on a Samsung core prime.",
"Will not do anything on galexy s3, really wanted to have my 3 yr old use the tablet instead of the computer.",
I have really great internet and my son has a new tablet but this app is so slow he got so irritated waiting for it to load. Also it will freeze when he is trying to purchase stuff with his tickets.It is the only app we have trouble with.,
"The app seems great and my kid loved it for about a week, and then he had no interest anymore. So I would highly recommend that no one purchases a year subscription, its money down the drain if your kid looses interest.",
Horrible no Customer service. The work doesn't correspond to the curriculum. I regret. A month free and still be charge,
I was excited to get this on my children's tablet since my son (4years) has a hard time on the  computer with it. However I cannot download it on their Android tablet. Even after getting an email saying it is available on most android devices. They have the ellipsis from Verizon so it isn't that uncommon of a device?? So I basically am paying for them not being able to use it. Highly dissatisfied.  I can put it on my phone (which is an android) but doesn't that defeat the purpose of them having their own??,
"They're been on TV advertisement for  many years now clearly spending millions of dollars on their advertisement to get more customers u think with this big of advertisement and blah blah fake parents talking about their kids improvement over the night.... Then they got it all together! Right???   Let me tell u about my personal experience with them  customer service! They don't even have a clue how to help out their customers this is only if you're extremely lucky can get hold of anyone via E-mail which is typically take them 24 to God knows when to respond u back again if you're lucky,and their response to my particular login issue please go check your connection!! Idiots !!!!  sure there's a customer service phone number u can call  always u get the recording due to the high volume of calls unfortunately they're unable to assist u and hung up! I have two kids they each have their own iPads  it's up-to-date our WiFi working just fine Everytime we try to open this app keep asking for login info and after that keep loading..... On our lucky days kids working on their learning patch consantly errors hanging and at the pls try again later!!!    There's so much negative reviews about them on different sites and unfortunately they never even tried to work on their technical issues and improving your customer service!!!  After all I don't recommend this app at all it's just such a waist of time and energy!!!",
I tried to go to the next lesson and every thing is frozen. It will not let me click on anything. Please fix it.  This is apart of my toddler education .,
"We have contacted  the manufacturer  many times. The app still does not function on nexus 7, or galaxy phones, or ellipsis tablet...really poor  execution. Very dissatisfied that my child must stay @ the pc to use this. Pointless for travel. I will not recommended",
"Downloaded to my android, not a member so i hit more info and all i got was a blank screen.... What a waste",
"You get to install the app, then you're told it's  $8 a month to use. Need to advertise this at the beginning",
I hate that we have to pay for kids to LEARN. I thought that kids could learn for free. Cause not all people can pay for it.so that is why I gave one star.,
When my son first started using the app it was amazing and taught him so much. I reccommened the app to everyone i knew. As it became popular the app started freezing and not allowing my son to finish lessons and with out be able to do so you can not move foward. I emailed so many times with no resolution.,
I cant get this app to download on my android. My daughter learns from it at school and asked me to download it for her use at home. I cant. Very üòû,
"They told me it was 30 days free, but started charging me the day after and now they're telling me I have to download this app to cancel. This is bs",
"i bought a subscription to this site for my 5 year old daughter, and it was 
hard for her to do anything without my help, so we stopped playing with it, 
my daughter is doing just fine without it. i think all children are 
different mine just didnt like this app!",
Would have liked to have checked it out for my 3 year old she's been wanting to try it..,
"This is a horrible app, it freezes on my son, takes forever to a load home screen,  and won't let me click something.",
SOOOOOO LAME IT'S JUST A DUMB GAME I AM 6 AND MY 3 YEAR OLD SAID THIS IS THE DUMB IS GAME,
It's working slow on some parts but I've tried everything fix this like now please I'm paying for this and my child can't even enjoy it,
They love the games.  Keeps them wntertained.  They even tell me stories made from their own imagination at ages 3 and 5.,
Does not even deserve 1 star. Got it for my neice on my tablet and it freezes up. She is 2 so any pauseing longer than 30 seconds and she bored and moving on to something else. Don't waste your money.,
"This app is a disappointment,it says it will teach your child ,but when I tried this app it didn't work on me. It is the worst.",
All of my children where bored with this app. When I canceled the subscription I was still charged after the fact. I'm so pissed and I still haven't been refunded. Don't waste your time.,
It says free learning sight but you have to pay up front 799 a month what a jokeüòí,
"Great app, has some bugs and he can't feed his pets on it like the site but its is great",
"I was happy to see there was an app. But after downloading it, I was disappointed. It would lag after my son finished a game. Ater a while it would freeze and would not even open. Hope it gets fixed. My son really loves this on our computer.",
I didn't mind paying but my 3yr old didn't seem interested in this at all. Really boring,
"I started my daughter when she was 2 and she is now 4, reading, writing her name, and counting to 30! She can read and spell better than the neighbor who is in third grade. They make it so fun you do not even realize your child is learning at first. I recommend starting young and doing the two year savings. You can't beat it! 3 kids for the price of one. It averages to be $15 a year per kid if you do the two year Price and take advantage of the 3 kids on one account!!",
Perfectly fine program but aggressive auto-billing.  They don't let you cancel.  I tried multiple times.  They even were able to submit the auto bill to my Citibank card once I received a new credit card number.  They were unwilling to reverse the charges.  Stay away!!,
I downloaded it cause it said it was free just to find out its gonna cost me every month for my kid to use this. False advertising it's free or not free there is no in between.,
My little brother is using ABC mouse and he draws better he answers questions and gets them right. And now his school is practicing ABCmouse. And his school really changed as well.üòç,
I think it is VERY stupid that you have to pay to get your child educated... This is supposed to be an educational aide for YOUNG CHILDREN. What kind of world do we live in that money is more valued than a childs education. Seriously America GET A GRIP! fall back on your roots and cut this money hungry modern bull!!!,
Dis is a berry good app. My sissies are smarty pants now 'coz this app is helping Dem get smarty pants. (I am in 6th grade I spell wrong on purpose I'm too lazy to the all the words lol) THIS APP IS VERY GOOD THO üëåüëç,
I would give 0 stars if I could... I got the free subscription and cancelled about 2 days later. They have since charged my acct. $1 last month and another $7.95 today. They have not refunded me anything as of yet. They keep saying it was successfully cancelled and apparently can't find the charge. I sent proof. I hope they fix it. This is crazy... There is no way to contact support except through email.,
My 4yr old granddaughter loves it. And its on my phone so she can have it at any time. Very convenient for anytime learning.,
"No this is an awful site where you pay membership and kids are limited to play or navigate the app because you need to purchase tickets? All the things in this app you can have your child do at home and it will be cheaper. Play with your kids one on one with flash cards, games and music. This is what I call a scam where they want more and more money. I feel bad for those who paid a yearly fee to only find out the site is not worth it.",
This is a joke. My kid lost interest immediately. On top of that they make it difficult to cancel. Very disappointed and frustrated.,
"After a lesson, puzzle or game the app crashes.  Most of the time it's before the progress is saved so my kids have to do the lesson over again",
I signed up for a free trial and they charged me $50 somethimg.for one things then almost another 40 for another .,
The app itself never works but the site although still messes up quite a bit is great. Just wish it would work! I refuse to continue paying for something that never works... Multiple different devices.,
You know Its v good plz download it you will love it. I am 8 years and play its alot of fun,
I got it for my brother it worked for 1 month. After  it stopped working it is not a good app the add may tell you it is good but it is not. It is the dumbest app I've ever had in my life,
"This amazing and so helpfull, took my girls from failing to excelling in just a few shot months, you people are amazing and brilliant.  Thank you so much.  Sincerity  Joseph sylvester",
"App stopped working after 2 months and wouldn't allow me to sign in on my laptop nor other devices. I paid for a year and got to use it for 2months, a ripoff",
This app doesn't help kids it gets them distracted with the hamster and the fish. Then they don't want to do their work or even study. It says its free but really it's not they charge you a dollar.,
My 2 yr old son wasn't getting it even when I was guiding him. The only thing that got him excited was the tickets. I mean he's slowly getting his Abc's but that's about it. Probably try again when he's a bit older,
"Refund PLS! My son tried this app and it's just so frustrating! He can use his own phone fine and chooses all the content that are fun for him! You get children can't enjoy it cause its so not user friendly and the ones that can find it so boring as well as I find it beats the educational wip on kids face! So frustrating, learning should be fun. This is so annoying! I paid for this and I want a refund we got it yesterday and I want some one to contact me and give me back my wasted $$$",
My son didn't like it the APP said it was free for a month not true  saw my bank account 19.95was taking out from themüòà,
It was a good thing for my baby girl she its so good for her now so try it pol it is wonderfulüòÄüòÄüíúüíôüíõ,
"I think this app is the best thing you all put together and that person that said its boring , then we all know that your child won't like to study because all smart children love this apps mam,its d best I'm 11 and  still check this apps out love u ABC mouse keep up d best  best app ever",
Why does it needs your phone number.Dont trust this game I thinking it wants to take out money from your account.This game is 0% Tustfull,
Kids got bored after a few months. Bad side is they take payments with out your permission and you can never get in contact with them they have you on hold for hrs they don't respond to emails or anything,
"Anything that makes you input a credit card before being able to use it is red flag #1, then you see why... the app is a joke, don't believe the bs in the commercials. WASTE OF TIME",
"the later version was better.  since I reinstalled it on tablet, the program freezes and doesn't work.  my son is unable to colour yet it issues a prize.",
Would be a great app if you didn't have to uninstall and reinstall every time u want to use it. If your 3 yr old accidentally closes the app... Well good luck. You have to go through the reinstall process all over again. More hassle than its worth. Better off playing it on the lap top and save your ears from crying toddlers!,
"I really resent an app that says free, but only after you download it you find that there is no free content. A first month free does not count. I don't mind in-app purchases to access additional content, but don't say free when it really isn't.",
The one reason I give this app.  one star is because that I cancelled my free trial before it was over an I still got charged me,
"It does not work on my phone, it just loads and loads and nothing happens. My phone is fairly new and has no problem running other apps except this one.",
I FEEL IF ALL KIDS DONR THIS THEY GO FARTHER IN LIFE AND THERE WOULD BE LESS KIDS HURTTING ONEANOTHER.,
My daughter is two and I think it's too young for her  to type or to know what she has to do. It would have been better if it was repeating classes for this age.so I canceled it.,
After completing an activity it doesn't do anything. Even after you close program and sign back in it still does not work. Love ABC mouse but its not working with the app,
"Just plain stupid! If you have a first grader,he/she will be very bored. I got rid of it faster than it was downloaded :/",
"I never write reviews but I'm so angry about being charged for a ""free trial"" when I cancelled after having the app for less than a week. The rules state that you have a month to cancel and not be charged but that's a lie. They will charge you a dollar then charge you $7.95 then another dollar and I'm still trying to figure out how to get a hold of them to make it stop. The app was super slow and didn't seem to interest my son so I'm extremely salty about being charged for it. Apologize for the angry review but get your stuff together and be more professional about your business and don't try to take advantage of parents trying to help their kids learn.",
The signing user interface is too difficult to use in a mobile device. For slow connections it doesn't load fast. I spent more than two hours just setting the account.,
I am 9 and I have a baby sister she is in preK  and she is going to learn so much thanks who ever made ABC MOUSE,
"I stopped using abc mouse online as my son seemed uninterested. now he is a bit older and has a tablet so I thought I'd try it again. terrible app. Not sure why you offer it for android if it hasn't been perfected.you should probably spend some of the membership money we pay to hire better developers before you continue to lose customers.I've uninstalled and already cancelled. All the app did was speak over the narrator with computer coding speak such as""clickable underscore image"" can't even hear the program nor can you click things correctly as the program doesn't recognize the input correctly. never again.",
My daughter really enjoys finishing levels and getting clothes and items for her room and fish tank. All while she is learning.,
It's very stupid... they can learn through something called SCHOOL stupididiotmouse,
I've been charged for 2 months & I'm a 57 year old woman with NO children. I'm downloading the app now in an attempt to CANCEK & STOP the payments from coming out if my account.,
"Installed on galaxy note tablet, app will open but does not go beyond the yellow opening screen. It then comes up with message saying there is an error. Uninstalled after doing this 4 times.",
My 5 year old loves it.  However it does make really easy to cheat (to earn more tickets) when mom steps away. AWESOME app,
NEGATIVE 5 STARS. We have a dell tablet and its not compatible for it. We loved ABC mouse last year. I WAS going to renew our account but this is just too inconvenient!,
I cant ecen log in without being kicked out. $70 for a year prescription and it doesnt even work. My 4yo can only use it on our computer. I hope I can have a refund,
"Dont even bother... all those commercial deceptive. Customer support is the 
worst. They do not respond. Always automated message. Always freezes, no 
prorated annual cancellation.. kids hated it after 2 months of patience.",
All i wanted to do was check ot out when its being advertised on television it does not say it cost .. then you read yhe comments amd there are so many complaints. Waste of SPACE,
"However, it tells me after every screen that I'm not connected and that I can work offline or retry. Retry and works fine.",
My kids live this app I have a 6yr old with down syndrome and she navigates this site with ease ... my 4 and 3 year olds live it too the have learned a lot using this program,
This app is horrible and I can list many reasons why 1. They are charging you if you don't cancel during the free trial 2. If you want to use the app for a year they charging you $60 3. They made the app for little kids to learn. so the app is a scam.,
"Trying to log in so I can end my subscription and the log on button doesn't 
work. Tried going on chrome and all it makes you so is download the stupid 
app. Annoying.",
Shady app takes your money even after you paid for a 4 month subscription. So you pay the subscription for a month it bills you the month after. It also takes your money months after you cancel your subscription. Don't get scammed.,
I'm not sure if I'll really work for me 3 year old brother so I'm kind of scared to show if it will work on him and if he will learn,
"This app is full of technical issues. The 1800 number was removed by the company. They insist on emailing dumb responses that don't pertain the the issues and the responses are not timely. The content is pretty good, the younger learning paths are better then the older kids paths. But the customer service is atrocious and the app and website are technically inept.",
Its pretty messed up that the app says free but u halfto sigh up n put ur credit card information in n they charge ur card after a month thats kinda messed up...thats false advertising,
"Dull, my 3 year was bored, and only interested in the coloring sections, plus it was advertised to cost around 7.95 a month, but really is 19.74. cancelled my subscription",
"Some of the games need some UX testing on non-touchscreen ChromeOS, but the content is great.",
You can't even get into this you have to have all the information about everything. now I can't even get my child to learn thanks a lot ABCmouse. you just made my kid education more harder than ever.,
"I the best app ever just like it's fun and you can learn how to do 
equations and stuff like that you know so yeah it's really fun and you can 
buy pets and stuff like that",
"I signed up for this for the free month to see if my grandkids would even use it. A couple weeks into it I tried to contact abcmouse to cancel it since my grandkids never yet have used it, only to find they've already charged my card for $59.99 and I still had about 2 weeks of my free month. THEN, not only is it next to impossible to contact them, but somewhere I found an email address and wrote an email to cancel my subscription, to which they replied that they would cancel it next September 2018 and that my card had been charged. I SIGNED UP AUGUST 17, 2017....it's now Sept  13, 2017....how is that a free month. When I again replied to that email that my card better not be charged and I wanted a refund since we've never used it and the month wasn't up,  suddenly it says that their email address isn't found......WHAT A RIP-OFF! Anyone have a phone#?",
My son has an hp tablet which I got so he could use learning systems. But this is supposed to be the best one and its not even compatible with it. Bummer.,
"Yeah it says it's free, but there is a monthly fee that I wouldn't mind paying except none of the kids (ages 15 months to 6 years) I tried it with cared about any part of the app when it did work right. I'm sure the program could work, but for anyone I've put it in front of, it was a huge bomb. I paid from September until last month when I gave up. It is very boring, the performance of the app itself is terrible, I wouldn't recommend it. Look up other reviews before paying.",
I am installing it and it's not done so please tell me if it's good because I have a 5 year old. She loves to learn so tell me a lot of good things about this.,
My twin girls learn so much while having fun it doesn't feel like schooling to them. Good job,
"My son liked the puzzles. Besides that he was quite bored. For the amount that it cost. It should have better graphics, songs, and games.. I was not impressed at all. Waste of money honestly.",
This says free but once you download it you find out its a 30 day trial free then you have to pay for it. Shouldn't be advertised as free if its not. Very disappointed.,
"It is not free, so I'm not sure why it's rated #2 in top free education 
apps. My 6 year old isn't able to navigate the app, see that it's for kids 
she should be able too.",
"I tried to cancel my subscription before they charged me and they charged 
me anyway I haven't used this app but a couple times.",
"They are unable to close your account themselves. You must go through your 
credit card or iTunes account. How can a company deny closing your account 
themselves. They refused to even give a direct response to why they cant 
close my account. Truly disgusting.",
"Doesn't work, put my card info in and could not get the app to work,  can't even cancel my subscription.  If it doesn't work on all phones or devices that should be mentioned",
I signed up for free trial and got charged. I deleted the app thinking i was done with it and i got charged again this month causing overdraft fees. Not i have to re download the app just to sign in and see what i need to do.,
The app does not work at all on galaxy s7 edge. It doesn't even open. I'm going to cancel the subscription right away.,
Hi I am 8 years old and I just wanted to say that when I was young I loved this game but I am now 8 so I don't need it but this app is  a good game I was the smartest in my class and I still am  ;),
I didn't even teach you nothing I won't let you login not want you won't let you create your own account,
I  LOVE MY DAD Love my daddy so much when he go to work l kiss my daddy so much u to daddy kiss u kamya today.,
My 5 year old daughter found it very boring. The games didn't work and even when they were they got very boring and Uninstalled it.,
"I would love to rate this app higher but I can't even use it. I've 
installed and reinstalled but the app just crashes. I have a new LG G7 and 
it definitely meets the min system requirements.",
"GODAWFUL - it says free, but when you get it, it makes you pay for a membership. Also, it tried to access my photos and media",
"Basically if you payed attention in school, then this is everything you 
could teach yourself. Don't waste your money.",
"I have had it for a week or so, the sound doesn't work half of the time, it 
constantly freezes, and random changes itself to spanish.",
My 3 year old didn't like it and my 7 year old didn't enjoy it. The offline content wasn't great. That said my 7 year old is in grade 1 doing grade 2/3 work. 3 year old just didn't enjoy it. Waste of money. Kept the app for months to see if she'd use but never has.,
This is a really great  game  of  learning and i think parents should really try out this game and you will be impressed by how your children  get affected  to this learning. I am a 5 year  old girl  and i can do such amazing things thanks to this app.,
I am going to get her back anymore and i'm gonna get me some good news tonight and I have been waiting on her since she left my house in new York city house in new Orleans this morning with my mom and dad in my life and she's gone through with my sister in law school in Chicago for the job done with my sister in law school in Chicago for the job done with my mom and dad in my life and she's still in bed and she's still in love with her husband and my mom is a good time in my book business in,
The only reason I don't like it is because trying to contact them to stop charging my account seems to be so difficult. Their still charging me even after the email stated they would cancel. This is crazy!,
"My child found it boring and never played with it. Was extremely difficult to cancel membership, had to involve my bank when they continued to charge my card after I cancelled.",
All this is is a browser window with kids games organized into categories. It's not worth the money. Can get similar apps free or for small cost. This site is just looking to make money off of you.,
"I have been waiting for ABC Mouse to make an ape for over a year now.Tried to download it after about an hour of waiting, I gave up. Vary upset. Please fix this.",
"This was my favorite learning site when I was a little kid. It used to 
teach me alot. It was so kid friendly.",
I called to cancel this before free trial expired and you're still taking money off my card...this is a rip off,
"My 3 year old is so advanced, even parents of children that are the same age comment on how smart he is, alot of them ask which daycare does he attend, but he doesn't I reply and I tell them you have to get your kids on ABC Mouse!",
"They will charge your credit card again next year for a WHOLE year and if you cancel that takes effect for the following year. We used app two times, now paying $120 . RiPOFF.",
"Do not need this program, my youngest is 23 with a master's degree in physics, I have no need for this program.. l DID NOT ORDER THIS PROGRAM...",
"It used to work and recently it glitches to the point where I have to uninstall it, redownload it so my daughter can play for maybe an hour before it starts doing it again. Please fix this problem.",
"My Son Loves The Game, It Has Really Helped Get Him Ready For School. Only Problem Is It Is Moving Really Slow On Tablet, You'll Hear The Words Before You See Them. FIX Please",
Good website but its pretty bogus you can't do crap on a phone unless you download the app. That's pretty stupid.,
I love your blog and it is not a good idea for the next three years to come and get a free copy of my book. Wright,
It really helps my baby brother get ready for kindergarten and school. It's always good to start a a young age :/,
I give it all cause ever since my little sister has been improving 100% more it is just wow,
"I have this on my PC and now on my galaxy s5, but still there is no app for tablets except ipad.  Would give it 5 stars but I really would like a app for tablets also.",
My kid already knows a lot of what's on there but it helps to reinforce it and keep refreshing your memory my issue is we don't sit home all the time and my tablet only runs on Wi-Fi so my kid can't really play unless we're home or somewhere where it has Wi-Fi,
"Doesn't work for tablets.  Keeps freezing in load screen.  Never really got to enjoy the App. For my son,  so we would only play on the computer only. Not his tablet.",
"Why even bother having an app if its not going to work properly. Lessons wont open up, its slow and glitchy. Computer version is way better. Traveling with a tablet is a lot easier than a laptop especially for a 3yr old. Very disappointed.",
Haha you should see his face he's like the most educated one in preschool or kindergarten,
My kid did the free trial without permission and linked it to my PayPal .. And now it wont even let me cancel unless I download the app which ive been trying to do for a hour now and it wont even install on my phone . This is stupid,
Wonderful  learning App that helped my son want to learn and grow more with lots of fun and joy. Thank you ABC Mouse,
It's  educational purposes only and my husband love's to help my children and soooo i loved it you do the sameüëÖüòíüíô,
The app should be free and you shouldn't have to pay you just want to steal money from people. Make the app free where you don't have to pay for nothing. Worst app ever,
"This is listed as free. It is not free, but the install give you a free ad to pay the monthly rate.  I am sure it is a great program, but this is false advertising.",
It was just too hard signing in and it would take her password I would have to do it over and over and over and over and over and over and over it was so dumb and I just discussed game and yeah but like like cousin didn't learn anything and I try to like to get it to employ my phone and that would be the favorite thing to do so I did it is so hard saying it up it was dumb Dum Dum Dum so don't get this at people cuz it could be dumb or did you get bus k bye,
When I was signing up the app charged me $20 twice. I had to call the company to fix it and I got a run a round. I wish I would have been able to access the app. The best way to download it is on a computer not the phone.,
"My daughter will be 2 7/19/17, and she has learned how to count and same some of her ABCs from using this app. Kudos to you!",
ABC mouse is great. It teaches lots of different things. As a mom I love variety based learning.,
I'm not into 30 day free trials. Just have limited features for free version. Uninstalled immediately.,
Awesome at first when I started this I was 5 and barely starting school it was a awesome app now my sister is doing it and she is very smart! üòáüòá,
But I read all the reviews and most say that it doesn't work :(,
The app wasn't great for my daughter. I cancelled my subscription & it no longer shows up in my Google Play under the Subscriptions tab but I'm still being charged! Don't give them your payment info!,
my kids like abcmouse but the problem they cant use it in our tablet because it crashes after we downloaded the apps.I hope abc mouse can fix the bugs and kids could play it in our android tablet.thnk you.,
My 2yearold. Didn't learn anything at all we tried it once but after that she didn't want to go on it again I thought it was a good website when I saw the video . but when I put her on there she liked it at first but the next day she haded it and didn't liked it at all.,
"i really hope that this app , will do the job for my daughter , now she is kindergarten  and next August she will be in 1st grade.",
Terrible confusing navigation.  Very inconsistent from one activity to another.  This app is a collection of low quality apps they bought.,
It isn't working right anymore and I don't know why. My kids get so much from this so id really like it fixed please,
Misrepresentation. Not free. You need to give additional personal info and is just a 30 day trial.,
we shouldn't have to pay to have our kids learn so disappointed. Fond similar apps just as fun for free,
It says it is free then it says 7.95 per month so don't waste your time with this okay.But if you want to waste time and money just go for it,
"It says it's Free, but upon opening the app for the first time, the entire starting page is one big scam app, making your only option you have to click is an Ad that, upon closing, takes you to a sign up page that requires a credit card in order to let you access the app. That's it. If you're like me and don't use credit cards, your child is out of luck. Do NOT be fooled, this is NOT free - unless you provide a credit card number first. If you don't have one, you cannot hope to access anything ever. Period. Abc mouse, I understand you give 30 days free, but you should not falsely advertise the entire app is free if you make people give a credit card number just to get past the endless Ad on the opening page. I wonder how many people have wasted data because they never knew they needed a credit card first. You as a company have so much money already. You can afford a Free, smaller version of the expensive desktop app you also make everyone already pay for.",
"I'm sure my little cousin enjoyed it. I was allowing him to try it for a 
few mths, I'm going to ask his mom to continue subscription.",
"Every time my son tries to go on it crashes and freezes. I thought it was just on my phone but also does the same on kindle, tablet and laptop. Please fix. His teacher is upset by it as well.",
This app really helped my baby sister alot. Because of this she is the smartest 5 year old sister in my family,
"It is slow and don't work much. I tried to cancel my membership but it 
won't let me an says I have to contact them then when I try the phone 
number listed don't work. Such a scam!",
I  love   it   because   it helps   the   kids   Learn   more  about   school   and   college   and   I   think   is easy   to   the   kids   to   learn   more   about   the   ABC   and   123 numbers   and   when   I was a kid   that's   how  I   learned,
Been trying for months for stop this app from charging me. I though I canceled in the app. I tried to cancle with paypal. It won't stop billing me.,
"6, 3, and 1 year old love this app.  1 year old calls it ABCD and needs assistance, but is enthralled with it.  We use it as part of our home school plan for the two older boys.",
"It's fun. I like playing  it, but when I play it on my tablet the game is frozen. So when I play on the computer it works better, but it's still a really cool app.",
Freezes between screens. Doesn't rotate both directions. And is a boy confusing to navigate around. But the content is very good and learning plan is well thought out.,
Please please please get this app working on LG tablets..so I can get my phone back,
"The app was so slow and constantly froze, I have the best internet. This is the first app that sucked. I'll just have my son use the desktop.",
"My daughter enjoys this learning app. She gets excited to learn using ABC Mouse.  It's a good one for us parents too, a break! But learning",
"My fault for not reading all of the details, but I don't think this should be labeled as free, considering how large the app is. Congrats to me on wasting 20 minutes downloading it and I can't use it.",
"Im uninstalling because Im always told im offline even when I'm connected to wifi, the few times it has connection,  it has to be restarted after each activity.  I oay for the service,  the app shoukd work",
My little sister I is playing this game and she's only 1year old and when I take away the phone she says 5 more minutes please. I love abcmouse.,
All of my kids love this app. They even use it in the schools here. My youngest is just getting started with it. She just turned 2. Looking forward to watching her progress with it.,
I played this on my dad's  lab top and it was OK but it won't  let  me  download  this game. Also  it says 5 OR UNDER. I am 8 years and I am NOT 5 OR UNDER,
My son loves the app it has everything a kid could ever want to do. ‚ò∫,
It's great for my babies to go learn and my babies say that love it so much it's so fun and easy and funny playing that ABC,
i like it i want to get it for my little sister so she can learn more and be good at her writing before she goes to preschool and i am going to teach her alot of letters and words.üòúüòùüòõ,
"Crashes every 3 minutes. And not even force close, I have to go in and shut the app off. Ridiculous.",
Misleading cost. If I were you I wouldn't get this especially when they are better apps that don't need to be paid to be accessed.,
The app stalls big time no matter what tablet or phone is used.  Disappointed considering its a paid subscription,
This game is so sucky because I can't even log in to it without it saying to me oops,
Better FREE apps. This is bad advertising,
This app could be great if it worked. We keep getting stuck on lessons and not all of the video work. I need at less 2 months free.,
Love this app. Very easy to use. Definitely helps my son to keep up on his learning when not in school. He doesn't know hes learning because he thinks hes playing a game.,
Hate that you can't access the website if you don't have the app and it's not compatible with all devices.,
The app lags and freezes on our new Android tablet. Didn't have problems before on our old model.,
"I have used this app for almost 2 years for my 3 and 4 year old. I am amazed at how fast they learned phonics, numbers, colors and shapes and site words. ABCmouse is awesome and I will continue to use it and advise others. I don't mind the cost because you can have up to 4 children on one account.",
We use mostly as supplemental program to help with what I'm already teaching. I'm really waiting for when the day I can customize so we can skip the lessons she has already mastered,
Thought this was a great alternative to sending my 3 yr old to preschool. A long with a couple of work books and you're little one will learn all they need for kindergarten.,
Apsulotle hateüòàüòàüòà,
"My son uses  this everyday outside of school, the tickets he earns for completing activities feel like genuine  rewards to him. I love it",
"Just love this app for my boys. They are leaning to read, count and all the wonderful things.",
Thought it was a free app just an advertisement for their website you need to have a paid subscription to access content....early education should be free In my opinion.,
Like it but kids are more into about me dressing and hamsters rather than lesson track.I'm just staying strict,
My 3 year old loves it. She learns at her own pace. Her 1st language is Spanish. With this app she is learning English. I don't have to worry about what she is watching.,
"Bordering for my child and she does not work with her brother on it they 
play games that are not for there ageüëøüò§üò†üòæ",
"Son loved it, now bored. Great app. Will re consider when he starts school next Fall.",
My son didn't like it and I have cancled my account several times they still charge me.,
Why do we have to pay why can't it just be for free it would be a great thing to do for my Lil sister,
"My daughter is 4 and found out how to cheat to get tickets faster. When she is focused on a puzzle or story it's educational, but as soon as she realized you could skip pages to get the tickets easier....now she's bored.",
"Under Android, before subscribing, it provided no way to exit except to turn the tablet off.  Subscription is $7.95 per month.  To many free equivalent apps to take a chance on a package that may take over the tablet",
Iam stuck with a yearly membership. My kids absolutely hate it and I have no way of getting the money back.,
I paid for a full year and it wouldn't load on either my phone or computer paid 80 bucks and they would only refund 19.95 of it would not recommend this to anyone!,
"The app is great for preschoolers but there are gaps in the math and 
English once you get to Kindergarten.",
I think it is a great learning app/site but why do I have to pay for it it makes no sense it's not fair to my kids because I don't have the money to pay for it and my kids are homeschooled. It would be a lot better if it didn't cost any money.,
This app is pretty much just a link to the website. Not free games or even a lite version. It wants you to sign up for a free month and pay.,
"This is kinda bad for me my mom bugged me to download it I mean She didn't 
bug me but she did Tell me to Download it and if I didn't She Will get mad 
and I can barely play it",
Fun fun it is very fun the kids loved it they don't like reading books but they can play educational games and it is very fun and educational for them so this is a great app why don't you try.,
"So frustrated to be paying for something that's almost not usable. The app crashes every two minutes, despite multiple attempts to correct this on my end. Fix this!",
"I don't know it yet I just give it 4stars because I don't know and I'm already 9yrs old but still want it,want it from small but,,,,my dad had to buy it on his computer,but,education is the most important thing and if you don't have education you won't go no where in life for example:if I want a job how I will do that,you need education because you have too go in school and you she too take a buisness and you can have a job,but,other from that, can't get a job that's just it",
"I dont know how i got signed up for this service, and now i have to idea how to unsubscribe, it wont allow me. Customer service is not help, but im tired of paying for a service that i never signed up for.",
"I installed on my note 5 and when I tried running the app doesn't get pass first screen and says I'm not connected to the Internet, when I have unlimited 4g data.",
It's awesome my sister so smart.,
"Galaxy S7; The app started out good. It would, than, progressed to be sporadically glitchy. It gets really frustration to get the app to work properly. The knowledge is there. Disapprove.",
what i have seen of the content of ABC Mouse seems good but this app is terrible. The  kids wont play because of the time for paged to load and freezing up.,
Signed up and ordered but cant open anything after it was installed just keep gettgetting the advertisement. Very disappointing.,
"You have to pay for free learning and mu lil sister like the app cause she 
got on it at school. Now she can't",
I think it's the best app. For my son that has AUTISM and it help him lots,
"I love this program. My daughter started a year before Kindergarten, and now her Kindergarten teacher says she has a second grade reading level. I am so excited with her progress.",
This app is very helpful.I downloaded it for my baby cousin üë∂.and he loves it he want to play it everytime he see's my phone.üìû,
Please  fix whatever bug u have in system it keeps lagging now it wouldn't let her start new lesson and hasn't given her the prizes she picked for last five lessons,
It may be free to download the app but you can't do anything unless you buy a subscription. Uninstalled.,
"Hey guys are doing well and the other hand is not an option for you, and the new York, and I have to be the same time, I am not going to 3",
The kids love it but it keeps lagging and crashing. Will put 5 stars when these issues are fixed.,
Too many bugs.  Every time my kids would play it wiuld freeze.,
I wanted to let my brother learn something but i m not paying mony just for an app Please fixs it :-),
My daughter uses app when she was in TK transitional kindergarten she's five years old and she's reading because of this app I'm downloading it for my son,
"I'm trying to deactivate my account and ten I try to, its preventing me from doing so by asking me to download an app I already have on my phone. I'm going to flag this as inappropriate. I should be able to deactivate my account whenever I want to.",
It's a great program for kids. I love it and it has really helped. I don't mind paying for a program that doesn't have all of the ads. Not to mention it helps my children.,
It makes me like school is awesome I'm in second grade I am in St Peter Catholic Academy Saint Mary's,
"Rip off cannot cancel subscription unless you pay 1 year subscription up front I never agreed to a subscription and now it wants to charge me $1,200.00 it's a scam and you cannot talk to anyone all you can do is send them an email",
I thought it was a free apps it won't let play it unless I pay 7.95 first disappointed,
It took 4 hrs just to get to 50‚ÑÖ and when it finally downloaded it kept on closing every time I tried to open it plz fix my kids want this badly,
I don't like the idea that you have to have a memebership so your kids can learn,
"I forgot my log in information.  I sent multiple emails and made several unanswered phone calls and never received a response.  The last call I made, I waited on hold for 45 minutes.  I had to cancel my credit card and get a new one in order to stop them from charging me for an app I couldn't use!",
Everything about it is ridiculous for the price. There are way better apps out there and for free. The games are so stupid! The learning not as fun as they advertise...it's bad,
"We just bought this for our 2 year old and she loves playing all the games, music and books. She can't get enough.",
I think this will help my child get more comfortable working with math and it's something she can work on by herself or with friends,
Just wants to take your money. Thought it was supposed to help your child learn not take your money not worth it,
When I put in all the information but It didn't work. Why do we need to put in the card number if the 1 month trial is free?!?!?!?! Not impressed by the way they made this game either. What if they use your credit card number to buy other things. If the 1 month trial is free then why do they need so much personal stuff. It wont even let me sign in. The tv commercials lied.thats how u can tell they are reading a script. They said a couple of easy steps. The bottom line is I dont like this app,
Downloaded but haven't had much luck with the app because it keeps crashing on me:(,
Oh boy! I like the app but your business practices are shady at best. We signed up to get a free trial only. We read the terms in detail and agreed to an authorization of $0.01 and monthly billing to our  PayPal account @ $7.95 per month which is ridiculous in itself.  All you have to do is cancel within the 30 day trial and we will refund your penny. Next they took it upon themselves to charge us for a 1 year subscription @ $59.95. I never authorized this transition.  Tread carefully when downloading!!!!,
Of course they want us to pay for educational (good)stuff but porn is free. What is this world comming to.,
it doesn't have an option to can on the web site. you would have to download the website to cancel. when you call they have you on hold for 45min before an operator pick up. Please correct it,
"This is so better than anything   in   the   world   you are crazy if you don't have this  I give it 1,000000%√ó1,000000+1,00000000000000",
You guy got this app saying free but its not and im not putting my hard earned money into a app i dont even know works or not either you guys are false advertising or scamming  people out of there money either way you need to fix this if it was up to me i would report you its all over tv that this is for children babies so it should be free my son loves this but if i pay and the app doesnt work i get played and my money goes to waste so please fix this,
I guess this is why I don't use a mouse from Staples based on All Things Considered so if you're using a barcode scanner and amounts from Staples it's also in the trash buried in dirt,
"the app crashes in the middle of my kids doing exercises. NO GOOD! especially after i started up a subscription and my kids cant even use the site/app for the intended purpose, TO LEARN!",
All of you are wrong about this that worked hard on this. So. Be happy,
This app don't work. I have been trying for 30 minutes to have it set up and it will not work.,
Can't get it to work on my android device. App downloads fine but says my password or username is wrong.,
ABC mouse is amazing for my baby sister. She learns so much. Through fun games to books to the alphabet. I recommend games for colors. One game is called the butterfly catcher. My sister and I love it.  Anyways ABC mouse is amazing and it opens up their mind.,
It was a little hard for him on the computer but so much easier on my phone/tablet,
7:00 for educaci√≥n i might as well just send my siblings to school instead such a retarded app,
I used this learning website when I was 2. I learned how to read when I was 3. I was reading chapter books like Junie B. Jones and The Magic Tree House. I can know read read at a sixth grade level and I'm only in fourth grade.,
If it isn't free it shouldn't say free then when u download it u have to pay that's bull crap,
Really upset says it's free but after you download you have to pay my son was super upset not impressed at all,
I think its fantastic to have a app like this for our kids to do positive enhancing activities in a world ran by technology. Great Job,
Ordered books before Christmas still haven't received them and getting charged for another month stupid u have to download website to cancel subscription,
My son he learns alot from here for me it's the best app for kids this really helps him so much !!,
It suck because it sed that not receded HAHA WELL AM going to GET MAD AND ITS SUCK WELL IT DOSENT WORK SO AM MADüòàüò°üò¨üò†,
Told me I would get a free one month trial. Still charged me when I submitted credit card info,
Why do u have to pay so our children can learn.  Sounds a little much if u ask me.,
"Charged fraudulently. Have no idea what this site is and trying to cancel account but no options via phone so been on hold with technical support for 18 minutes and counting. Seems to me,  if you're all about children,  you wouldn't be so shady when it comes to customer support",
Won't let me type in email to open on android phone. At home on computer love it. But traveling would like to use on phone.,
"All of my kids love playing on this site. They are all advanced in their classes, and I believe that ABC Mouse has played a big part of that.",
The app took forever to load after my daughter only used it for 20 minutes. I read tons of bad reviews...I hope I don't have a problem canceling my subscription.,
My daughter loves this app and has since she was about 18 months old.  My only complaint is that is laggy even on my galaxy s7 and sucks power down quickly.   This should be worked on for future updates.,
It's really easy for my sister and it's really teached her how to work hard she's entering kinder and I just thought it would be more helpful by downloading this for her to get entertained and learn at the same time üëç,
Abc mouse helps me keep sane by keeping my curious George entertain and educated. Thanks,
My son didn't like this app at all. When  I tried to cancel my subscription I was told to follow directions in Google Play store to cancel which I cannot find. Terrible customer service......,
So far everything I've seen on this app has been great and my kids love it and never want to get off of it,
My son can't get enough of all of the fun learning tools. He loves to learn and this app is definitely designed to help your child!,
"Can't get to load past the log in screen on my sons tablet. We've tried reinstalling, creating more room and restarting nothing has helped and app runs slow trying to load.",
Stops working in the middle one thing and go's to another then it starts saying weird things,
Please refund me in full. I cancelled my membership.,
i dont like that all you want is money. This should be your own reward because helping kids is a better thing than money.,
I cancelled my membership months ago and I am still being charged!  I have no use for it and they keep charging me and ignoring my complaints.,
"The app shuts off and alerts me that my ""phone is getting too hot"" when it's not any warmer than it always gets when using any other app. I uninstalled it.",
It wasn't beneficial enough for my child he got bored and ABC mouse makes cancelling damn near impossible. On plus side not all kids learn the same so take that chance because you don't know.,
"Remarkable on laptop, my 6 years old son loves it and I'm glad he is learning through fun activities.",
"I have NOT been able to use the app cause it's not compatible with my tablet,  have NOT installed it but still being charged for it. Please cancel auto payment. Thanks",
"This game was very good for my little 2 yr old cousin and yr old sister 
they had lots of learning time. It was so fun for them as well.",
Nothing that could teach a child,
Very disappointed i paid a year and now my son cant use it due to its not compatible wuth the tablet. He can use my phone but still not happy.,
"Ive been trying to cancel my subscription and when I click to cancel, it 
takes me to a blank white screen. When I try to contact abcmouse it goes to 
a blank screen. My son doesnt use this app anymore. I dont want it and I 
want it gone. I have no way to contact them or cancel this is bull.",
Can't. Get in to hard keep trying but no don't download let your kids watch a learning video on YouTube my own is watching it right now so go on YouTube now,
it's a rip off due the fact it says first month free but it charges your card asap,
The company charged me without even giving me access to the app. I want my money back and I PASS on the app.,
"It's way to slow and glitchy. After almost a year of having it and trying it, I'm getting rid of it.",
"Super app, I just wish I could control how much game time my kids used. They are more interested in building the aquarium and hamster cage than learning the alphabet, numbers or colors, etc.",
I did not want this and I have been trying for two days to cancel this and I can't unless I download the app which I can't do to space and the number had me on hold for over an hour until I was disconnected and the call back option was useless because I waited all day and never got a call back I want this canceled asap I attempted all I could.,
I don't feel comfortable about giving them all of my personal info I am a mother of a three year old a4 year old and a6 year old and they love this app because there Grandma has it I just don't feel comfortable with it.,
We love it definitely recommend to anyone who's child is struggling in any area,
"My 5 year old hated it. He thought it was very boring and lost interest within the first 3 min. The best part, to him, was feeding the fish in the classroom. As you can imagine, that grew very old, very quick.",
"Not free, don't know why it's in the top free educational category.  I'd be ok if it was a true free trial but I'm not giving you my credit card.",
I get my 3 year old logged in only to have to log in again everytime he goes to a different page. Frustrating!,
This app is perfect for my son Jordan. I promised him if he got 5 answers right we could go out. I like it. He's 3 turning on 4.,
This is really helpful.now I don't have to teach my little sister when I come home from school everyday.but I still have to give her my phone so she can learn from the darn thing.,
My 5 yr really enjoyed parts of the games but this program was really not user friendly. Poorly organized software. PBS kids is so much better. And it's even FREE!,
"Says free. Opts for 1 moth free then $8 per month after that. Plenty of other apps like this one that are totally 100% free, unless you count your bill from your service provider.",
This will ask for all the details like cvv . Card no everything . I don't think this is good for kids,
This app promotes itself by saying the 1st month free and before even asking you if your going to continue you they hit you with a 7.95 charge very displeased with it . And my 3 year old hated it .,
"my son is 3 years old and has begun to learn number, letters, and is even saying sentences. we LOVE this app!!!! nothing wrong with it and it's a complete app with lots of learning games. What are you waiting for? Download now :D",
This is how you do it it helps your kids learn faster the party is over on ABC mouse. Com I think this is an excellent I think that everybody's child got a rite to learn more I think that all of you guys should let your children get on it it really helps it is so coolüòä‚ò∫üòÜ‚ò∫,
ABCmouse,
"Tried several times too cancel my subscription, it will not let me.... My 
daughter has not used this app in months, I thought it was going too teach 
her something she did not know.....",
I don't expect it to be 100% free but make some features only to people that pay and not make it cost money for everyone!,
"It's an okay app my daughter likes to skip around on things it's alot reputation back to back which I think is what's ""boring"" her a little . But once I tell her where to go with it she loves the fact that she advances and get tickets.",
Only thing I ordered & never received  anything but are getting charged for them please help,
"If you cancel after your ""free"" month, they do NOT give you your money back. They take it anyway amd basically say screw you. Thanks ABC mouse I had an emergency or I would of kept it, but you took the yearly fee and cancelled it. You're thieves.",
I left eye I like my life and my favorite thing is my uncle entire day it's so fun and my favorite thing I just want to tell you guys this is after I want to get this life and this game too today and I don't know what to play to play this not to today well I think today I will want to play it right download and I want to write to it and have her I'm saying too much things for here and with you guys I just want to tell your life story and just my friends is my sisters playing with her tablet and I am doing here with my tablet talking to you guys I don't know,
Where is my free 30 day trial on this? I signed up on this March 1st 2017 and PayPal has already taken a payment out of my account for this. I'm pretty sure I've not even had this app for 24 hours!! I want my free 30 day trial first before I pay my first payment,
My 5 year old child is working with this and i think he needs more to go on.but IT's a good start.,
Isn't easy for my daughter to use ..she gets too frustrated!,
"App is extremely laggy, barely usable. If they can fix the lag issues, this could be a great app. Otherwise, you'll have to stick to the PC.",
This app wasn't helpful to either of my son's they were actually board with it.,
"Be careful, the worthless clowns like to charge your bank two and three times a month. Then when you call their 800 number you're told to email them and they NEVER reply.",
Very educational.and my son loves it. Subscribed and paid! Well worth it:) not sure why there are bad reveiws. Works perfect every use,
"When I see the word ""free"", I should be free. Instead this is download bait. I read in the reviews that it instantly charges your credit card.",
My 3 year old love it can't stop playing on it an learning extremely much would refer any parent for this app for your kids it's AWESOME üòÑ,
Its great but too slow my daughters gets tired of waiting on it to load,
My brother Richard thinks it so fun even I get in it we play it and every morning he says could I play on your phone for abc mouse he enjoys it a lot  we love itüòçüòúüòÅüòÑüòÅüòÑ,
definitely not what you would think. it would be.  tried to cancel forever and no one contacted me.,
All my kids love ABC Mouse I'm so happy it's an app so they can enjoy it without a computer,
Subscribed and decided to cancel before free period expired and the snuck acharge in . Every time I cancelled a new offer appears which I declined. . a month later a charge appears on .my. Card. . pretty sneaky if you asked me,
"This is an amazing learning app for kids ages 1 to any age needing academic 
help. My little brother lives the app so much he could spend 2 to 4 hours a 
day on it.",
It is the best thing I EVER done for my baby sisterüíïüò≠üòò,
"It had me enter my password 10 times, before any of my four children even played a game. You have to enter your password before doing any game, switching users, doing anything. Once you're in and have entered your password, it will continue to ask you to enter your password. I deleted it and cancelled my subscription.",
"Once you sign up..  it's like a contract that you must completely pay off even after cancelling! Learning objectives are short, not very educational nor challenging! I'm goin back to STARFALL!!",
"My daughter had a hard time navigating it. Even after I showed her everything, she didnt like it.",
"I signed up and it wouldnt go past the registration part it just kept loading, and loading. And Its not my phone! All my other apps work. I deleted It! Very upset!",
"This has taught my little sister so much. She loves playing with it all the time ,she never lets me use my phone. It is great for kids like 3 to 6 or maybe 1 to 6.",
"Cancelled after trial period and still got charged 2 months later. After reading the reviews I see I'm not the ONLY one. ABC Mouse is using are kids to rob us, one family at a time. Shame on you!",
I can't download it on my samsung s6 phone but we have it on the iPad and my son loves it,
My kids stuck on level one after paying. Can't click done on printables. Galaxy grand prime.,
Their customer service sucks i called them 4 times and was on hold over 20 to 30 mins each time. Plus if you have to contact them through their website they force you to download their app. Very sneaky....dont like sneaky people.,
My niece enjoys it and for all who have problems with it just get it inline in a pc,
Free means free!   I shouldn't have to pay monthly subscription.,
"Im older than 7, buts its funny to get everything right so easily xD",
My children have been enjoying this app it's very educational and it has been a great help with me trying to juggle two jobs and having the time to help them with their homework and complete other errands thanks alot ABCmouse.,
I got the $7.99 for the first month but I just started a free trial which supposed to last 7 days. This is a direct robbery,
Have my grandkids on it. They love it. But I am having trouble down loading it on my phone.,
"I love it. It gets her to get smarter,and to learn things she needs to know I  the future.",
My 6 year old cuz plays this. But she only pays attention to the hamster an coloring.Every time her mom says u cant play it she crys around. No she hates me..,
"I keep putting in my email and it says to put in a valid email, will not let me register. This is only 1 month free.",
I but it for my sister because we do not know how to write  she 5 I'm 10,
"First of all, we cancelled a day after beginning to trial. THEY CONTINUE TO BILL FOR ""ASSESSMENT CHARGES"" EVEN THOUGH I CANCELLED. The app has a terrible UX for the age group and even adult use. Not worth the money, even after you've canceled.",
Never had problems loading the site on Dolphin.  I just set it to my home page and let my kids have at it.  It's nice to see a dedicated app.,
I downloaded this app for my granddaughter because it said it was free and had good reviews. That is false advertising because it's not free,
Don't call an app free then charge for it as soon it's downloaded. How unethical.,
"App says free, but when I go into it it says it costs money.  Freaking rude!",
Do u have to pay that's wat I'm worried about and it downloads fast,
My child really enjoys ABC Mouse and it's educational which makes the time spent playing good too!,
It's not as easy to cancel account! You actually have to call and usually the hold is busy and it takes an hour so answer,
"They charge you when you're supposed to have a free trial, charge you more than once a month sometimes, and even after you cancel you still get charged. Don't give them your card info, they'll take all your money.",
"I don't really have much to say because my child didn't really used it he 
only used it for a day. But that's not your fault my son just prefer to 
read his books and play with his flash cards so this is why I don't want to 
renew my membership because I don't need it.",
The one on the bottom don't know he's saying he needs to hush it up,
Abc mouse works great for my 2 year old and my now 7 year old who struggles in reading.,
App says Free... but you can't play it unless you sign in and give them your email address and agree to purchase the service for $7.95/month... if you say the app is free let people have it for free like other toddler learning apps.,
It says it's free but once you download you have to sign up and pay.. would be nice it they were truthful.,
"It is in the free downloads, but that is only the first month. After your grandkids played it and really love it!",
"App for indoctrination into liberals doctrine. Will never let my kids view 
this shitapp",
Hate it star fall is much better every thing is free,
My toddler loves abc mouse and I am excited I found something good for her.  She starts preschool in the fall and I am hoping this gives her a little headstart I love this app!,
I'm glad I read the reviews before I actually opened the app. I don't like how it is advertised as free but to play anything you have to sign up and give your credit card number that's not free. False advertising..,
It works so great for my brother he his only 3 and he know how to spell his name and read . thank you so much !!,
"I don't want to subscribe for a free month, coz most of these kind of trails has hidden fees and traps.",
Guitar but doesn't teach you anything can teach you anything in 3rd and 4th grade need more games and be free,
"Downloaded the app and signed up, but it freezes up and won't load please fix this and I will give 5 stars",
My 7 year old likes it but it hasn't helped him better his reading skills,
5hit**jjfnrnjrtzdgh ty have hj c just jjjvhnvbnb,
I am very displeased with this app. My son hated it which is not something I say lightly.  Customer service isn't helpful and they will charge you for services you never receive please beware they don't refund them either. :(,
It's horrible. Do not do it they keep charging your card even after you canel.,
It's so cool my sister and cosin and brother learned a lot of math skills like everything like * spelling out words it's just like a you like learning everything like they're in 6th grade but they're not 6th grade I I'm in second grade right now I'm almost in third grade add my sister and cousin are and in kindergarten and my brother is almost in kindergarten and like they almost like learned everything from sixth grade to kindergarten,
"I have a 2 year old and 4 year old and both my kids love ABC mouse. They are always wanting to be on it. It definitely has helped them will speech, ABC, 123, reading and much much more. I get it buy it yearly",
"Stupid, it tells u its free so I download app but in order to play the games u need to pay 7.99 a month to subscribe or the app is no good. So I  uninstalled. There are so many free great learning apps",
Love the app but its too easy for my toddler to press a side button and kick him out of what he's working on since he's not completely coordinated yet,
I have to pay just for getting my kid freaking smart its to expensive,
This is a good app for my little brother and sister ketravious-3yrs old shiyonna-1yrs old they both is going to learn about abcs and enjoy themselves..üòÇüòòüòúüéâ,
"ABC mouse is a great learning site but the app doesn't offer you everything 
that the computer does and if you try to go through the internet to access 
what is not on the app you can't and must download their app.",
It's not the best game I have ever played but it's ok,
I love it because it helps my 2 sisters read and Wright and my little sister is ready to go to school horaa!!!the other one is ready to go to 1st grade yippi!!,
Simple access to my kids progress. Love how interactive and all the activities!...most of all love how the parents can mingle with our kids!,
I've tried for many days now to download this app and I can't! Its a good idea but just doesn't work.,
"My daughter loved it at first, but she quickly became bored and discovered YouTube...now she only wants to watch YouTube vids while on the computer.",
"When you first open the app, it shows a shitload of advertisements and asks you to sign up. No thanks.  Uninstall.",
Helped my daughter get caught up because she was a little behind due to circumstances beyond my control.,
"We love this app so far, but it lags and it freezes my phone a lot. Please fix this",
"I shouldn't have to uninstall three apps, to download your app, to cancel my account because it takes up too much memory ant time, to have to uninstall it again. Twice. I already submitted a cancellation last month, but you still charged me today... It's ridiculous.",
No such thing as free subscription. They charged me first quarter,
"Paid for whole year, foun on our galaxy pad very unresponsive, 3 year was bored with it, found FREE games on Google play that do the same thing as ABC mouse, found ABC mouse to be not worth the money!!",
I wanted my subscription cancled last year but apparently I didn't do it the right way and now they have charged me again for it and they offer no refunds or any way to make it better.,
AWESOME!  Great for early learning. I started my grandson on this site back in 2014 to present.  Now i used this also for my childcare business!,
I tried reinstalling on the same device and keep getting error -20. My son can't even use the app after paying for it!,
"I have been trying to cancel for months and still even after I have deleted 
the app am still getting charged every month. My grandson don't like it and 
has no interest in it. Again cancel my subscription and stop taking money 
out of my account for nothing. Don't have it. Don't use it. Don't want it. 
Stop stealing my money",
They steal money even when u cancel and i wouldn't recommend this stupid app to nobody!!,
Whether its at home or in the car my kids love ABC mouse. They are learning so much and don't even know it!!! Great Job ABC Mouse!!!,
I try using it but it was not working trick you I love it my son and daughter they love it,
"My son kept seeing these commercials and had to play, however, after logging on a few times he was quickly bored as he had learned this and more in preschool.",
My kids are so excited to have this at home now but the app and site keep crashing so it's very frustrating. I will not continue my subscription if this is not resolved soon!,
My five-year old loves it. AbcMouse assists her with Math and other subjects by using creative learning techniques.,
My son loves to play on our free time. I work all the time and never have time to sit with him and teach him and when I do I never know where to start so ABC Mouse is a great way for me to start and to spend time with him with out wasting time trying to find something to do with him.,
Told me the 1st month was free and then charged me for it. They better fix this.,
Downloaded app and it won't even let us log in but web works. Needs some fixing.,
This is a big rip-off!!! Took my money and made me enter my child's info just to cancel my membership!!,
"I love the app, I just hate how it wont download on my sons tablet.",
It's very unfortunate that you have to charge people for this wonderful sight. Times are hard for a lot of people and even though it says it's like $8.00 a month which is not a lot but on a single mom's salary I don't even have a credit/debit card to pay for it with. When you advertise this you should say it has a charge before kids get their hopes up for nothing.,
"it says its free at the app store on your device and then if your new to the app you have one free month and then you have to pay 7.99 I think,that is a rip OF",
Its a babyish game I thought it would be like a game 5th grader would enjoy but I don't like it,
The app doesn't work. It freezes up and doesn't take you to the lesson that you want to go to. My son was trying to get to his lessons and you can press all over the place and it won't do anything. This is horrible and not even worth a one month FREE subscription. I'm actually canceling the subscription now that I was charged for and requesting my money back.,
I love this game so much i can't stop playing it,
Not working properly... click on the activity and it's says we are currently working on this program,
"Impossible to stop the billing process, cannot get anyone on the phone",
It won't download and i so have lots of space and and a little data in my phone!,
Website will not allow cancelations. App download required. Wack!,
Its awesome my son has been blind and he can blow this up and he can see it and he's learning,
You have to pay $30 every month,
Its it's a good for kids that quite don't know their ABC's one two threes pluses and mineses,
ABCmouse my child learn more and get better at his grades he loves ABCmouse to thank you for making your own this app this is the best app my son ever had I tried a million of games on his tablet and they didn't work but I finally found the one that worked for him I love this app so much thank youüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ,
It will help my little sister that is 5 years old she's in his start that she needs to learn even though she's in school still can learn and I just started this app,
"There was no free content. I'm a grandmother looking for apps to have when I babysit. I don't need to pay a monthly fee, but I was hoping that if my grandsons liked it, I could do a gift subscription for Christmas. All we got for free was a commercial. I refuse to create an account just to try something. It's a shame, but I guess I will be buying Leap Frog toys for Christmas.",
Maybe all the parents trying to cancel but can't need to file a class action law suit to stop the subscription and receive money from the time of trying to cancel maybe then they would  answer emails and fix the site.,
Why do I have to download just to found out that it's a free trial,
This won't download on my Android tablet and my daughter like to use my tablet and she is use to a touch screen and this app only download to a laptop. Which sucks. But other then that its OK for children,
It helped me when i was 4 years old and i am saying to it that i love it BECAUSE it helped me so much.,
The app is crashing and not installing so I will cancel my subscription asap.,
I started my daughter at 6 months and now she's on a 3 year old level at 2 1/2 years old.  I highly recommend it !,
I am a 8 year old this=boring WASTE of timezzzzzz NEXT!,
It wouldn't even let me sign in.  Uninstalled,
It was slow for my 3 year old. She became bored quickly.,
You can create your own avatar and get a lot of tickets and you  have your own room and you can buy toys for you backyard and you can pick any background you won't and you can buy stuff and I think everyone should download this game and I love it and people should give it 5stars,
I love this app and so do my kids! It's absolutely fantastic and they love to learn! Unfortunately the app is unreliable. I pay for this and it rarely functions and its pure robbery for them to take as much as they do and we can barely use it. My daughters open tasks or subject and the page goes blank and states there is no such page and that there is a problem! The bigger problem is that you are taking my money! Improve your site so we can actually get our monies worth and use it!!!!!!!!,
"IT'S SO STUPID. USE IXL INSTEAD. AND ABOUT THE RAINBOW WRITING NAME TOOL, WHO DA HECK DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE THIER NAME. DON'T WAST 300 GB",
Great!! My son was so engaged in this. But then again anything is better than Five Nights at Freddy's and YouTube videos,
ABC mouse helps me learn things I don't know,
This is the best leaning site ever! It has helped all of my children learn with all the games and rewards. Well worth it!!,
I hate this there brainwashing kids its stupid. Dum people,
Hshd no dnsjjs,
You have to sign in to log in that mouse game I'm saying its not boring I just want my kid to learn new things  f.         I.        X.,
My 4 yr old doesn't like the app. He thinks it boring,
I think that this educational app is very helpful to kids.it helps my child to be focus and it takes up  most of her playing time because she loves it.,
Very boring very scammy my kid lost interest in 2 minutes I went to get his apple slices (takes 5 minutes) I set him up he knew what to do and when I came back he was playing with his trucks he said it was boring and he tried everything,
U guys helped my sister alot and she is 5 and she can count to 20 thank u,
They charged me twice in a month for 3 months. Had to cancel it,
Such a scam! You download the free app only to find out it's only free for 1 month then you have to pay monthly!,
Just wanted to see if it's so great that My  Grandchild Tonya will pay attention to this.,
"It said free educational, but this app isn't free! False advertising",
App is so slow kids get frustrated. Crashes and takes too long.,
Yes the download is free but it cost $7.95 a MONTH to play it,
What is up I can't even get into this site and I can't even find a number to call about it I have never had so much problems downloading anything before! Please let me know what is going on or at least give me a number that I may call,
It is not free cause in the game it says that you have to pay every month so unstilled,
"My son is almost 3 and has the Nabi 2, I just signed up for ABCmouse a few days ago, he is very tech savvy on his tablet not so much on our PC, I'm quite disappointed, I've already been experiencing problems with this tablet and I don't recommend any parent buy a Nabi, but when he opens ABCmouse it won't let him play certain games...I don't feel like he is learning like he is supposed to as they claim, please fix and I will rate a 5 star.",
My son tried to do his reading lesson and it wont give him his ticket that he earned for doing it.,
"you people need to work on how these apps operate you have billed me for 
nothing I wanted nothing from this app I hate this app stop billing me this 
app has nothing for me I have no small children, I deleted this app months 
ago well weeks ago now I have to reinstall the app so I can go and cancel 
this app this is ridiculous I shouldn't even being billed once for this 
stupid app.",
"A great way to set you kids up for success before starting K, as well as a great way to supplement great material in a fun way for kids up to 2nd grade!",
The app says free then you try to get in and it asks you to buy a membership.,
Why do we have to pay for learning dont you guys want every kid to get smart. Why do we have to pay for our childs learing,
This is ok my daughter ijust played games and doesn't learn anything,
My goddaughter loves Abc mouse and I love how her face lights up when she plays the activities.,
It's perfect!  I don't know why many people are using other places,
This app is one of my daughters favorites. It got updated on her tablet and now it doesn't work. It let me enter my login but then just gives me a yellow screen. I tried to use it on my phone and it is laggy and freezes. The update has done more harm than good. If it's not fixed I'll cancel my subscription.,
Too many free aps out there. This one is not worth the money,
My 6 year old lit up seeing abc mouse. Best reading and learning enviorment ever.,
They charge to my account. I canceled it before 30 days too boring for kids,
My kids really liked it and it's a good learning method so I recommend it for anyone who has problems teaching there kids or for getting your kids ready for school,
My kids have grown so much frm oldest to youngest they absolutely love Abc mouse üíØüíØ,
"I have a little brother and he is not doing well in school, so I am trying to get him to do good in school",
I love it alright its OK  but it keeps staying still can you please fix it and I wasn't exactley wasn't going to log in or sign in just to make an avatar so I can play and watch an learn and color can you please fix that to thanks any way s I love it thanks,
They're going to love it. B-),
Do not use this! I have been trying to cancel for MONTHS and yet again they charged my card! They are crooks. They won't let me cancel and they steal my Money! STAY AWAY!,
I was excited about this app then I realized AFTER I downloaded it (wasted my data use) that you had to pay $8 a month to play this app! Very disappointed!,
"I signed up for 30 days trials and was billed bf the due date...I was never able to get the classroom bcos I always get message to download the app first. Meanwhile, i already had the app....Want to unsubscribe..",
It went let me in because I have.one dollar in my account,
"I think this app is perfect .Its perfect for my 4year old brother.If you are reading this, then check the game out.",
My grandson loves it. He is autistic and can't get enough of this app.,
It's good but the games took so long to load the kids lost interest.,
So didn't know ABC mouse had an app! Now letting my 4 year old learn on ABC mouse is that much easier on hmy phone or on my tablet. Awesome!,
Why cost us parents at home over $80.00 for this game some parents don't have that kind of the game my kids are disappointed cause it cost way to much,
Does not work on my grandkids tablet. Payeing for something I cannot use!,

My child has learned how to read a two year old I am glad to be apart of the ABC mouse family. All my kids love A B C mouse !!!,
"I don't understand how they can pay for an app that consistently DOES NOT WORK? When it worked, which was rare, it was great. However it just frustrated my daughter because the app wouldn't function.",
I was skeptical at first buying this but WOW my 3 yr old daughter really loves it. She loves it a little too much but it's awesome! Go for it people!,
My son is delayed in his talking and this has made a world of difference we have had this for over a year and he still loves it!!,
We can't wait till it stop downloading it,
It's a great learning experience for my preschoolers they are working well with the help of ABC mouse,
"ABC mouse is fantastic. I never in a million years thought that my son 
would do as well as he has. Thanks ABC mouse",
My 5 year old found it extremely boring. The app itself is really outdated.,
"I tried getting the game for my little brother, but it costs money.That is 
ridiculous, i wish there was at least 1 super good educational app like abc 
mouse. Com.",
This app keeps freezing during download process; even after 4  attempts. Get it together ABC Mouse!,
I'm just trying to keep my brother learning he's only three but I think he can do this,
Love how my son laughs so much and has fun while getting a good education. He thinks he's just playing a game .,
My 4 yr old loves this app. Great learning app. A must have. Thanks,
App is extremely slow and kicks my son off when trying to do lessons.,
may be able in this is the way to be a bit and I can be a bit and I can you can you be a lot of a lot of a bit and I have any attachments questions or not sure the way of a bit of a few month's salary is not the way of this is the new one of a bit and I can you get it to see you can be a,
You should be honest and tell people that you have to pay to use app instead of having it listed as free.,
i could't sign in because it said that i could't sign because i don't go to summer school and i do go to summer school i need to learn more.,
Lag time was crazy and it charges your account monthly without a notice or invoice.,
It's the best thing that I've ever seen you should get this app because if you don't you might not get to learn but this might teach you!,
We don't know yet we just loaded it on her phone,
They keep Billing me and my son stays bored on this site.,
I love this the curriculum is great helped my son in math &reading not to mention sighting words I couldn't ask for a greater school in early development so from a thankful parent thank you abc academy!!,
It does not work it is teaching my kid gross and bad things,
"The programing in this app is beyond fabulous! Just trying to find how to get the evaluation area is hard for me, love my son's desire to be on here!",
I love it on the computer! The app on andriod is horrible! Keeps crashing and logging out!,
"I signed up for the free trial. Downloaded the app. When I try to log in, the app crashes. I tried numerous times, re-downloaded the app, to no avail. Logged into the website, each time I tried to navigate the site, it took me to the download app page. I logged out, scrolled to the bottom, clicked customer support then clicked on the cancel account link, but it took me to the login page, which I did, then it again took me to the download app page. They get your info and won't let you cancel.",
Even when I canceled before trial ended. I was charged.  My son found it very boring.,
Rykhdgbggj IA zb gmchnsjhjk I have been a long as I am a little bit of the list is a great 20th,
"Love this app, so worth the money. Not expensive at all and my 3 year old has the love to learn.",
Unable to use I can't use it I need it completely free no payment method one star,
I don't know the password or email to the to this game can you tell me what it is? thank you üòâ Are you in love with somebody?üòö,
Just give them the game and mind your own business.,
My children love this app  In school they had problems but now there very good In school,
I have used it with my students and my own children and they all love it and it's very educational and all my parents have agreed.,
I would give it a 5 star but it takes FOREVER to get someone on the phone for anything you need!!! Wait time is over 30 min!,
"My 3 year old wants to play this app all day, everyday. I have to make him take breaks! He loves learning and loves ABCmouse!!",
"Its was great for my 2,3,and 1 year old not and girls they know a lot now",
"I love it!!! it Makes my Kids Learn it's Really Helpful! Now my kid said 
when he needs help with something he said he will always Play this game :) 
thanks alot for making my life easier",
I Closed My Account But They Still Taking My Money. #Lawsuit,
I think it is the best because my  child can learn more and at the same time she's having fun,
because I don't have a credit card to get this for my son so plz put free so I can get it for him thnk,
I'm still Lil but I have a nephew and he LOVES it he is only one but is super smart it is an awesome app,
My brother is learning a lot but the problem is that it really doesnt work,
It's very slow. Games don't work. Please fix I'm playing for this.,
This is a great app!!! I have a hard time getting my child to get off of it,
This is the best learning tool this year. I love it and so do my kids,
"This is the best app ever my daughter,mikaylah I'd put it on for her and kayla was taking off.hahaha",
I just wanted some music some childhood songs for my granddaughter to listen to and sing along with it said that the app had that and that it was free but it wasn't,
My grandson is 18 months old and has learned 1/3 of his abc's...great app,
Its not free to use. U have to enter credit card information,
Hate it my brother hated it he can't learn anything,
This app sucks dont get it does not even teach you anything,
Very good for all ages even passed seven years old. It all depends on how fast your child develops. AbcMouse works with them just like a game but is really teaching them very good skills their future!,
I did't know you had to log in or sin up I'm not that big and little it's between 1-10 if tell me if you got the number!!,
My 2 year old have more interest in other apps and YouTube videos and actually is learning from them. The toodler section is a little boring.,
Have to keep installing stops working,
Will tell more once we get used to it.,
They billed me away! AND TOP IT ALL OFF THE GAME ARE BORING...,
I signed up today to start the 30 day free trial. Received confirmation that my free trial started and then viewed my bank statement(same day) and saw the charge from ABC Mouse. Very misleading!,
This app helps me with my math  it really helps me it's a great application I think other people should use it,
"I would like to cancel our membership, please. It's under my husband's name Nathan E Joles,",
"I think those who choose to learn there should not be a age because some 
people didn't get to learn correctly probably and educational material 
should not be denied",
I have an grandma that I can review things that I have learned so when I do my homework she can help me on it and I am in fifth grade at buna elementary.,
"I love abc mouse for my two kids. There is so much to do books,games, coloring etc and it's all educational so they're learning while they play.",
I think it's a great app for toddlers to play on and would learn alote of thing to go in college :D,
Boring and lameüòù this is for 2 year olds don't install this app,
"Its soo cool even my baby brother thats only 2 knows his A,B,Cs and 1,2,3s",
It's a very helpful application and  it would be much much better if you send us hard copies certificates about the kids' progress. Thanks.,
"My grandaughter is having trouble in math, hopefully this will help her.",
So awful made little brother dunce and teased at his infant school,
Not the best app u need to put  a creidt card,
Had to put in credit card information first thing complete waste of time,
Stupid why does it say free when u have to pay 8 dollars a month,
Gets really gliche and how ever made this l will attack him,
It loads slowly and I have to wait 30 minutes,
It doesn't get start its just loading and loading for hours . Waste of time,
I don't even have credit card I am only sixteen,
They will take your money even after you stop your account.,
Great for summer and winter vacations. Children get to keep learning when they're not in school through this app.,
Worst thing ever free to download but got to pay so much a month for a kid to play a learning game that is horrible pay taxes and everything else that's messed up school fees are not enough I guess.,
who do i contact in Regards to cancelling future payments. I need this done ASAP,
I can't even get it do download and now I can't even get through in the website cause it wants me to get the app,
"My daughter has learned so much from this app, and she has so much fun with it. We will continue using it.",
"The app says its a free app. I suppose it is free to download, however that's about all you can do without paying  $7.95. Should be clearly stated when looking at app.",
They are so fast to take your money but make it impossible to cancel your account..,
My children love this app. I enjoy the benefits it provides them. A great and entertaining educational program.,
This app really work's for me because it helps me with my kids it helps them to understand the there homework and get it done,
Too easy for my 4 year old. It also caused my tablet to have some kind of thermal event.,
IM 9 AND IM STUPID,
"You have to pay and you can go to school and get than for less and you can 
get a tutor",
It is stuped I cant log in my sister. it makes you pay for it,
Got the free trial and it had charged my account after canceling it after a few days!!,
Nothing but s*** how do you need to pay for a 12 month I don't want to do this opposed to be cheap no just playing this shouldn't I did App instead of the s*** you should is b******* I don't know why it just worked perfectly but it doesn't even clear and I need a credit card number in his stupid what are you thinking I have better Happy smash your face now where is your street address now I'm at right now $60 for a year really is that kind of s*** free trial is not free it's garbage the shooting erase this trash please don't download this s*** right now  how to learn garbage instead instead of educational because it can make your child learn how to use Electronics it's fake the commercials Ally and don't ever download,
Hey this may sound crazy but I'm nine yes old and this game helps my daughter savana,
Don't even let me move forward after login in,
It is ridiculous that I have to pay for my child to learn. It says that it is free,
"I have tried for months to delete my payment info and they keep charging me. The app freezes constantly... do not get this stupid app. ,. .",
It doesn't work you have to pay money for it oh I hate,
Ok it's  not loved by some  users but it  doesn't  mean  the ones who  wants  to  download it  can't  download it,
This is an amazing app !! My 3 yr old daughter absolutely loves it. It is well worth the money .. I would recommend this app to any and eveyone,
Really hepful  This app is the best because when I showed my little cousin this she loved it I she likes this better than playing around all day.,
"19 dollar a month for this app I think that's a lot I would like to 
canceled my subscription as soon as posible",
It's not Free! False advertising! $7.95 a month does not equal FREE. Tell people before they download the app the Truth,
"Want to love this, but won't be renewing because the app constantly logs my kids out.",
"I have gotten ABC mouse for my grandkids twice and could not pull it up on my computer either time, but I tried  it  one more time so far it has worked knock on wood",
Im in forth grade and i half to do this &gt;:( i hate my life,
App will not download to Droid Turbo(2015). Completes download and says cannot install with an error code.,
Such a useless game you have to pay 7.95 a month counting all the bills you have to pay just remember it's taxes time!!!#taxes time..noooooooo,
Very useful I also get into the fun with her makes me think when I went to school. Xoxo the developers thank you,
Love it on my laptop but downloaded it on my phone and says this app hasn't been adapted for phones yet,
It cost Money and I don't he a credit card and they say they will mail the ABC mouse bill to your house. Don they it!!!!,
Just so you know all the negative comments this app has got is from people have never used ABC mouse before cause they don't believe in paying for a extra learning experiences for there child..ABC is not free but it's worth it if you child tablets this app not only does it teach them wouldnt you rather a child play on app that they learn from over a free app that isn't education ..this is awesome n teaches my child while she has fun at same time it's worth it to me,
Downloaded app a couple days ago and it has crashed EVERYTIME!  I had to restart my phone everytime I tried to open it because it would continue to try and open on my phone. Ugh!  Ultimately uninstalled it!,
It is d best learning app it helps in many ways and it gives my little sister a boost in learning,
This game is Good for learning but you have to pay money every month. Accept For the first month,
It helped my great Neice out a whole lot she never wanted to get off the computer thanks a lot,
I love it my son said this is the best game ever I'm like this is helpful it helps your kid learn,
There are many better free alternatives,
It's a fun way for my four year old to learn his ABC and numbers.,
"It wants your credit card information right out... I'm not alright with that, plus the inconvenience of having to cancel it. I'll stick with the First Grade Learning app with the owl on it... There's a lot included in that app that is highly beneficial to my child's education.",
Its not free for a month like it saids and on top of tjat has to pay to canceled it,
it would not let my little child learn what I want her to learn,
But it's bad I don't like it gets stuck,
This app is very fun to my daughter she is learning quick and I'm happy for her she is geting straight A,
My oldest grandsons been using this wonderful site for 3 yrs and now his eye old brother is going to join him in the fun and learning. We All Love it!!!,
My 2 yr old daughter loves this app. Always either on the computer or my phone or my wife's,

App won't work on my android phone and says my android tablet isn't compatible,
He didn't like it at all nd thought I canceled my subscription then all take that stupid eight dollars off my account with no warning,
"I love this app is my favorite I'm about ready for first grade i need to 
get ready for my new grades like first second third i need this app i 
downloaded but one problem is sign in",
"I hated it because I am trying to teach my 4 year old brother , I am 9 and I don't have a credit card like my big sister does !!!",
Great but takes up a lot of space and tends to run very slow but is a wonderful tool for kids,
I love this my 3 yr. old is already brilliant this just enhances his intelligence..,
"I just wanted a new York, but 6. If you are looking at the University, and a few days",

My 2 year old daughter loves it.  I think it's great for children of all ages.  Awesome learning/teaching tool!,
"I don't like to buy fee is really expensive,and back my money plzüòà",
I was not sure if my son would like it but he now ask to learn,
Might be free for download but you have to pay to use it.,
While he was a year and half I started working with him on it but he got bored very fast because he caught on so quick. Hopefully we can discover something to work and challenge him,
I really like‚Äãto learn so it will help me with summer break,
This is very good for little kids like 5year old,
I am having fun now I am only one wake up till 9:23am,
Never ever refunded me even I cancelled last month,
I loaded this app on my phone for my little brother who is 2 years old and he is going to School this year I want him to get a head start and this app helped him so much,
"My two year old loves this!! We seen the adds for this on tv and figured we would.try it out, she plays every day",
"A very good app it's very fun and to all of you who say it sucks yall are 
so wrong",
Once I get to try it I'll let u know says installing but never starts the percentages the bar just keeps sliding to the right like its thinking,
Loved it,
IT SAID IT WAS FREE THEN IT ASKED FOR MONEY,
My 3 year old loves this site what a great way to learn while entertaining my daughter.,
Have an easier way for people to cancel their accounts instead of trapping them and making them jump through hoops to unsubscribe.,
"I love abc mouse, it makes hard learning a thing of the past",
Abc mouse is awesome I love it my mom got abc mouse for me but I don't have abc mouse but on the bright ...,
It's very easy to help your child learn I love it my grandson already knows a few words,
This game isn't the best game that I've ever seen I've seen a lot better.,
"My nephew loves this new learning app, I'm glad to see him excited.",
The activities are great. My son is having a lot of fun and learning at the same time! Best of both worlds,
I downloaded this for my brother it asked for credit card info I was like nope not doing that,
This was the best game ever and love it and it's a great game for pre-k kids,
He plays on this everyday. Enjoys the fact that he can have pets and learn about them.,
My baby brother's learning and I'm crying I'm happy,
And all you people who hate it  you guys report it and it will work  i djd it and they  fixed it right away,
Love this for my son....he is very interested in learning and its great for one on one time too,
This is the best learning app on the market. I love it. It has helped my daughter so much.,
My son is 5 and loves this game... He like to trace and see all the tickets he gets.,
I've been like it too good I didn't like it too good it was sort of trash how you cut that cut tbv hat off,
Too slow on my tablet happy too have this for my almost 3 year old,
I believe that this would help my children grow and develop into being the best they could be in life and in school .,
This opinion Shut Up and Dance not without your kisses I'll be needing stitches that's what we dance to tttttt top positive records display I suppose This Record Falls display go back go back go back meow meow meow meow,
I did not know it cost money i thought it was free i will start starfall now,
My 5 yr old loves it but the app will not load.  I will not pay for something she can not play,
Not free not free not free not free.  Have to give cc info to get free month.,
Got my uninterested 3 year old interested in learning.,
"Billing is awful, tried the first free month and they charge my account.",
This game is really good game if your kids won't stop  drive you crazy!!!,
So they don't tell you that you will have to pay for a membership,
I love it .it help my sister a lot thank you the person that created. üíó,
Trying to cancel my account finding it very difficult to do so,
My little brother has autism and this helps him so much,
Of course you need a credit card and unable to explore anything,
I unsubscribed from it but they still charged me not happy,
Never try it but by reading your own comments I grade it,
Qwvesw_ever CCNY I gantry high thing my tiny hezf,
Why did u kill my old message you twerps,
My children never get bored with all the activities and mouse introduces,
Because it is not working for my little sister to learn it,
Keeps on crashing when I use it and it has a lot of bugs and cookies,
It goes blank  sometimes fix ir please,
Just another monthly drain on your finances. Why can't I buy an app once and have access to what the app is supposed to do? Subscription services are a joke. Do not download this.,
Very educational. Some bugs that had to be worked out. But overall a great source for kids. Tons for them to learn and play!,
I think it's amazing it really made my child's love of learning come to life thank you,
You can't say it's free and you have to pay yeah I know it's  something that teaches children you should not have to pay üò£üò£,
My son was not interested and he is 4. Too easy for him.,
"Scam. Gimmicky. It's difficult to use. You have to upgrade once in the app. Was hoping to have an experience free of ads and in-app-purchases, and willing to pay good money for it, but that's not ABC Mouse.",
I love it my child's learning to spell her name lerening to read thank you thank you so much,
If I van say a cuse word I will say it,
I really love this game it's great for my child and and its really good I just love it so I just really thought it it I just would like it so its it's good for my child you guys because when you get to know it it starts getting good her and good and then your child rose and grows and just start to play it so I just downloaded this weather reason so my child learn and do something with her life instead of just playing video games yes ma'am,
My little sister loves this app it's so educational and cool my Lil sis learned a lot by abcmouse,
Great program for kids. My three year old learn to talk by using abc mouse,
This game helps my little brother alot in he's Reading and skill,
It so boring and not fun and I hate it,
This free app is an advertisement only. Don't waste your time.,
We've had the application for almost a week now and it is amazing what she can do and what she is learning this fast!! ABC Mouse is for us!,
When i entered keeps saying email in valid,
This is a excellent source to add to children developmental growth in life is the absolute best thing to come up with to expedite children's education,
It is good  and i love  it and I think this for 1-12 to play this bc some  don't no number and reading,
The jafar turn to the 8th. This was my fault for a long time,
I don't hate the content it's the app I use a compatible  device yet it still freezes up,
The app won't open on either one of my devices but it sure as hell still took my money off my card. I want a refund this month!,
Please subscribe to Mohammed playz Mohammed OUT,
This app does not work like they say it does,
I hate it it so bad for my kids you guys are bad,
I swear it helped my lil brother,
The  Pink  panther  games,
Its boring its not like they say,
I do not know how to it would download  it for my sister,
I hate willow,
I hate it  It costs money  Dony get this game,
Every time I have to go back and forth,
I got it then i put a password and had to pay,
Horrible after cancelling they still billed me ugh,
They want  u to go to there web,
Not sure if you have any other information,
I hate it why is it so difficult and cannot sign up,
Why do they want so much information,
This is a very great game my kid has gone  above and beyond üòÅüòÅüòÅ,
"Perfect for my 3.5 year old son! I definitely recommend it. Not very 
expensive and well worth the monthly fee!",
U cant use it tell you pay for it and some kids whant to learn withput paying,
Works well on the computer freezes up and goes too a white page on the android app,
"Its a good app, but if its really for the kids and to help them? Why should we pay. There are many more great free apps and did I add FREE I think this app should be free",
I paid for a subscription yesterday and the website is great but the app won't download. I've tried 3 times - once while on 4G and twice on our home Wi-Fi. I have a Droid Turbo.,
Its a good app. It just opens randomly on its own when I'm working on my phone. I have had it.,
My sister and brother love this app!! They wont stop asking to use this app on my phone!! ^_^,
It helps my child learn and grow stronger. It is like all the apps rolled into one.,
"Loved it, it really gives me personality to live up to. It's a very good resource.",
"My kids love abc mouse, but your app won't work on either of their tablets they are getting for Christmas, so they are using Starfall since their app does work on Android tablets....very disappointed....non Apple fans are becoming majority so please make it work!",
"I like this app. Cause it helps my granddaughter to learn to pay attention 
and to be still to learn.",
Relly  you need to put you agress in order to play! Plz fix. I don't know how to spell agress if its right than yay!,
Don't know yet rated it so it would not ask me in the middle,
It's stupid!üò´it won't let me log in! Stupid stupid stupid! All I want is to do the hamster stuff don't get this it's crap,
"This app is great forever young children about to start school. My 4yr old 
son loves it",
It does not  have alot of games in side,
They stay occupied on a screen with out a bunch of garbage on it,
Shawn Michaels the same thing as well as a friend who,
My children love to play games and this assists their learning process. Thanks ABC MOUSE,
I am my sister teacher and i want to be a teacher so please don't mess up my dreamüòÉüòÉüòÉ,
I love that I can add 3 of my kids on. There's lots to do! Very educational and fun. My kids like the feature where you earn stuff to decorate their room.,
"My granddaughters love ach mouse so far. I love how it keeps them engaged 
while learning.",
ABCmouse is not for just babies it is also for people who want to learn more and not just me it can be for people all around the world,
love the app... but no i no longer need this and i have need to cancel the subscription but many trys and no success,
It would be nice if it was free because my parents dont want to pay for it.,
Rip off,
"Why is this advertised as ""free"" in the Google play app, but it is not free?. I love it but will not pay for a tablet to raise my child",
This helps my son alot and they have many games and activities for him to learn,
This app is fine all around.  Add other languages to support multilingualism.,
"It work on my Fire, but i can't log in on my phone. I see the log in 
button, but nothing happens when i pres on it.",
Keeps freezing trying to cancel my subscription but it want let me my grandson gets frustrated with the app because its hard for him to work it when it freeze he gets upset,
My kids get bored after a while,
My little brother loves it I dont understand why people don't like it,
I did It on my sis to see how it worked on her and she loved it .So I tried on my datagters and they loved it.,
Best STOP MAKING  PEOPLE DO PAPER WORK but I liked it,
Best learning app ever now my kids know a lot of things,
They charge you without your authorization! Lots of problems with them and lots of headache as well!,
It is a good learning app for little kids i mean its awesome,
Great learning tool for my 2 year old who' picking up new stuff everyday!!,
I haven't anything better for my children to help them learn great game.,
Its amazing helps everybody learn and I just think it's for everybody and I love it I got it for my baby sister and stuff,
I wish u didnt have to pay though,
My son has learned so much and he  love it,
I hate this app I think it is stupied that you have to pay to usr this app,
When my two year old started spending more than an hour a day on a screen I knew it was time to sign up for a interactive program. He loves abcmouse because he earns tickets for his work and then is able to purchase clothing and toys for himself. He has become so independent ever since we started using this program 3 weeks ago! He is now three and can count from 1_5 in English on his own. We are bilingual.,
Its good but it only works with girls because the boys always think its boring,
Tacky to label this as free when nothing is free. Free trial only requires registration.,
I love and adore ABC mouse. My daughter has been apart of ABC mouse since she was 10 months old and people are always amazed at how advanced she is and she's almost 3.,
Not free. Need to pay for a membership to a website. Misleading to call it a free app.,
I cant login or sign in hmmmmmmmmmmm I wonder how you did It,
It was good,
What i hate is that you have to use a cord because if you don't have one it will be a struggle because it is really good and people will be talking about it,
"My kids struggled with staying on an actual ""learning path"".. too many things going on, and it wasn't progressive imo...didn't work for us...starfall was much better",
It says free yet you only get 30day membershp and can't opt out of emails,
Soooo many great things to see and do. This app is great,
Can not download the app at all it's been downloading for 2 days already had to stop the download,
None of the links work the only thing my child was able to do was feed his fish,
I love this app im 10 but there are some things i didnt know but Abc mouse worked,
My son and I did not like this application to boring.. sorry. But not cool at all!!!,
I love it so good it helo me past all my my test,
Hi I am going to be able,
My daughter got bored with it right away and I was told I wasn't going to be charged the whole canceling fee!! But they did!! üò†,
I  love ABC MOUSE I use it in my preschool classroom my kids are so interested in learning everything.,
"Its awesome Who ever made this, thank Now my kid is smart thanks ABC mouse",
For little kids like my sis,
It was more frustrating than educational.,
It's like so hard to get on like that's the part I don't like about it,
"Wonderful app for my 2 yr old son,  he's learning so much",
It teaches my boy a lot of good things,
Bait and switch! Supposed to be a free app but really just an add to push an online leaning system. Booo!,
So many glitches on the phone app. Kids still love it,
My son loves it only it freezes yp but I love it,
This is amazing i am 13 i play everyday,
My boys use this app all the time.  We even have it for laptop use too!,

You have to purchase a subscription for this so called free app.,

I think it is awsome for little kids and it makes little kids so so smart,
Can't even download it. No access from normal website.,
"I think its a good app for younger kids, it helps them get a head start",
Stupid I can't even play the game and I'm eight,
"Didn't keep my kids interest, so I didn't keep the app. But when I went to cancel the subscription, it told me I had to download the app! So now I am wasting data downloading this nearly 70 MB app, just so I can cancel it!! Then uninstall it again! Ridiculous!!!!",
It gave my kid a great education learning is everything now thank you!!!,

"Is good but not an awesome  app like others says. You can choose from lots of free apps so why to pay a monthly subscription???? Honestly  if is a price for the app is ok but month by month? Is ridiculous,  is better to have a kid in preschool and they going to learn much more than in this app.",
I think it's good for my little  sister so she can learn.,

I tried to download it won't work,
My son loves it!  It teaches math and reading. In a fun and enjoyable way.,

This app is very good.I had usig it in one day and its very interesting,
I love it my sister can't get in school so I started this,
