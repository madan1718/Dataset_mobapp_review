"The UI is not user friendly at all. For a health application, one would think they would take into account poor vision, poor coordination, shaking hands, and other conditions where having small icons and buttons are a bad decision. For example, what is up with the redesigned medication reminder? The check marks require a magnifying glass to see. Could they be any smaller? What a ludicrously stupid design choice. The check marks should remain prominent and obvious at a glance.",
"The only reason this is 3 stars is because although this is an essential app for someone like me, if you hit the wrong button by mistake and it takes you out of Symptom Checker, for example, you lose everything that was just there even if you'd went back in there immediately. There's no way to receive back the symptoms you had entered. That had costed one star. The second star was lost due to not being able to list all of my meds and conditions. So I cannot get a full read on many features.",
"I miss the old symptom checker interface. I mostly used this app to help figure out the vocabulary of the parts involved with my symptoms but now I don't have a place to start. I also do not like all the added features, I have separate apps for those and it's creating clutter on my device. I'd rather have an app that does one thing well than a bunch of things poorly.",
"Symptoms; Limited/Not Versitil symptom lists. Medication: it won't let me list all medications: I can enter any one or two, but then it stops finding additional meds. I cleared the list and looked for one I couldn't find, and it showed up. I then try to find one I'd had in my list before I cleared it and now it is missing.",
"This doesn't replace your allergy app, no dark theme. When you attempt to rewrite an app, the key key thing is duplicate functionality. You missed on this, dev 101. Update: Dark theme? Landscape mode...",
"Negative stars if I could! Doesn't matter what you put in ""search"", it doesn't answer your questions. What a waste of time and space on the phone! Don't bother because there has to be a better app!",
"Great app for getting an idea about medical conditions you may be experiencing. What happened to the visual selection? The one with the picture of the human? I'd much rather select a body part than type and scroll through a list of words. Might work for some people, but I prefer the visual aspect of that selection method. Please bring it back... Just as an additional option. Why take it out?",
Fast and simple medical facts foru understanding medical terms and conditions. Highly recommend this app.,
"What happened during the last update, now I can't look at the possible conditions to see what could be wrong, instead it comes up with an ad for WebMD and I have to start again via the browser.",
"This app is terrible for people who have multiple symptoms or diagnosis. It doesn't save any of your information after you put it in, and I've tried over 10 times! I have multiple symptoms, and have seen multiple doctors(for over 15yrs) I just wanted a general idea. Doesn't save any of your information, no matter how many times you put it in. If it does save any, it doesn't give you any possible results. The online version is just as bad! The website, you can't put in over 30 details!",
"Can't see more information about my results because it is just an advertisement for the symptom checker for which I am trying to see the results from! What, you want me to do it twice?!",
I do like this app because I also went to the website on my computer. I do wish that they would bring back the old symptom checker rather than the new one cuz I do not like the new interface with it it's a lot harder to navigate than when you could just click on the body parts and then click on the subcategories and go from there,
"Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.",
"I love having this app at my disposal. I dont use it often, fortunately Im pretty educates in medicine, but its great to have an immediate answer, research, education, facts, articles, even someonw live to assiat you! Plus the notifications are great! They constantly keep you in the medical loop with the latest news, explorations, diagnostics, current events with certain crisis' or even tips on how to stay healthier. I wish they had this when I was a child but its here now!",
"this app used to be great. It would give you an avatar to select the affected areas, and a very extensive list of symptoms. It would then have follow up questions about the symptoms you chose. Now you must enter it all manually, and there are no follow up questions. In my opinion, this used to the best symptom checker available, but now it's just garbage.",
"Used to be a really great resource, in perfect working order. Theyve since updated the symptom checker, which is now extremely frustrating to use and is very disfunctional. Should have left it the way it was. No longer happy with how this app works.",
"I have found that searching for certain terms, such as ""dementia"", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.",
"Among the worst apps I've tried. Home page looks like ad flyer. To put in Mom's birthday, I was forced to use calendar (5+ minutes to scroll back to 1930). It let me search 2 meds to add to her profile. Once set, I found no way to add, edit, or remove a scrip.",
"I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.",
"The old online symptom checker would let you select an area on the body where you had pain. If only the app did, too. This app makes you type in what specific organ/part is causing pain. Well... I don't know specifically where it's coming from. The list they had to choose from didn't seem to apply, anyway. The old online format would then ask additional questions to narrow results down. This app only asked me one question that didn't really get me anywhere.",
"I'm getting really sick of this app. I go to post it important messages from the coronavirus for example, it posts two posts so of course, I delete one which apparently delete both and then I can't find what you sent me in the first place! If you can't do something right don't do it at all!",
"I only need reminders for meds and supplements. This app only allows you to select pre-set brand name pharmaceuticals. Cannot add your own custom items (such as Cucurmin or Alpha-Lipoic Acid). Also, reminder notifications are not aggressive enough. People with cognitive issues such as Alzheimer's or ADHD will most likely fail to take their meds. The app needs to repeat popup reminders until the user acknowledges taking their scheduled dosage.",
"The drug interaction checker not working properly. Says it found 2 interactions but only describes 1.Shows it found 3 interactions but only describes 2...and so on.Does not save my drug interaction entries anymore. Have to re-enter everything,each time I want to check something. This started happening with the lastest update..extremely frustrating",
"Great information so helpfulüôè in so many ways. There are so many topics are useful to read. Its informative & I find interest in learning something new. WebMD talks about health, preparing for procedures, biopsies, etc ,. Being awareüëÄ gives me an extra advantage of what's happening today. I always say do your homework before having anything medically done. Because knowing early will make the difference in life or death. Highly recommend subscribing.üë©‚Äçüíª",
"Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.",
"I downloaded this app on my iPhone when I found out I was pregnant with twins. The app now that I've changed phones, it doesn't even show me what my babies are both doing this week and not even telling me what changes are happening to my own body. I'll give 5 stars as soon as I have as many options as the iPhone does. Even signing in didn't help. Pls fix this and I'll gladly give 5 stars. Don't recommend to download if you're android or switching from iPhone to android.",
"Worrying Advert & Privacy Policy. Says company will share private details with advertiser to deliver targeted ads. Opt out links lead to error pages. Dedicated opt out app opens in page which looks like Play Store but is not. Clicking button on that page, labelled ""Open in Play Store app"", leads to page does not exist error. Uninstalled as appears invasive. Will use website instead. Website provides an excellent service, useful information and advice including evidence for and against treatments",
I really like this app. Keeps me informed about meds I might switch to or others I might need to take with the ones I am on now. Always like reading the post too. FYI to anyone who is reading this and who made WebMD. I tried to open it and it kept rejecting me. I uninstalled and reinstalled and worked. So if having any problems try it. It's like the last update didn't fully install or install right. Hope that helps someone.,
After install it states it cannot connect to the internet. All my other apps connect to the internet just fine. Had to uninstall until they fix the app. Other than that it was ver informative when it did work.,
Can't find Chronic Venous Insufficiency or Deep Vein Thrombosis under conditions. Absolutely useless to me.,
I have to say I was really disappointed I expected a much more personalized user-friendly app. I looked for side effects got the pdr version instead of just an answer and then trying to find my Dr was impossible. I live in a large city and apparently all the drs in this city are located at the same address in the same office . The filters are useless . I put in within 5 mi and it was giving me listings from other states. I just expected something completely different,
This is a very helpful app to have on hand. It's versatile to many ailments and conditions. Saves a trip to the Dr or at least gives you symptons you can arm yourself with before going. Especially where children are concerned. I use it for my grown daughters and their grown kids. A must have app.,
I liked the app better when u pick from a body. It was much easier and description of symptoms were better to find. Now all symptoms are urgent and they are not and description for certain systems aren't there. No help.,
I think it's nice to be able get in information about health symptoms,
"Entering birthday: 0 stars. I had to click the back button, month by month, 13+ years to select the proper year. Sign-in to an old account: ""Does not compute."" I have an old account and was unable to log in because of my password letter number inclusion policy unwarrantedly. new email and the exact same password worked. long story short: I have an account with previous info. no access. scrolling: -5 stars. after entering info, meds, or spending time on a page will not allow scrolling at all.",
"I like the option to add current medications and conditions with the symptom checker, but the majority of my medications and diagnosis don't come up when I write them in the search box so I'm not sure how reliable that feature is, or the app as a whole (though we know it's not meant for a medical diagnosis).",
"WebMD keeps current and gives a lot of good information about health issues. My only complaint is that after changing my password several times, I still get the message that my password and email don't match. Trying to correct this problem wastes my time and really makes me crazy.",
"I get notifications from this app even though I have them turned off. Don't want news articles clogging up main screen preferred the older, simplified version. It's not user friendly anymore.",
"A great resource for all things health and medical-related. I use the symptom checker feature the most, but the app also features articles on health conditions, information on different medications, and COVID articles. Definitely a great resource, and completely free!",
"Excellent application, every phone should have",
"I haven't even really used this app. I downloaded it because of the following claim.‚Ä¢ Customization and Saving Functionality ‚Äì Save your conditions, drugs, doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and healthy living articles for secure, easy access and reference. I don't see anywhere that I can actually do such a thing.",
Symptom tracker doesn't work,
"You all will hang like fauci , only got a star because it is the only way to post.",
This is a decent medical app good for simple medical issues. I found it doesn't work for me having multiple medical issues. It could use a place to enter actual lab results to help with the diagnosis.,
"I want to easily see if tumeric interacts with all 20 of the other things I am taking. It would save me a lot of time to be able to enter a supplement that I would like to try and press ""check for interactions between this medication and all of the medications in your list"" Please add this functionality!!",
"When entering a birth year, it appears that ""sticky keys"" are set as each year has to be entered as opposed to scrolling through the years. This is highly annoying, almost enough to make one give up.",
"Used to be a very friendly symptom checker but, I can't even specify where the pain is because the app doesn't have that symptom in their data base. For example, pain under left breast or even left side of the rib. It's that simple, but I made it too generalize to even get an idea what to tell your doctor.",
"This app sucks, its slooow, buttons work at random, when they decide to work at all, I couldn't even get far enough in the app to completely describe my ailments. I DON'T RECOMMEND!! I uninstalled immediately after this review.",
"One of the better aps out there. It is quick and easy to use. Wish there was an actual Doctor to talk to that accepts every form of medical. insurances. ***** (5) stars. A must have apt that is within reach for those all important emergencies, that always seem to pop up out of nowhere.",
I love this app web MD because it great for finding out might be wrong with the person !,
New Update buggy. Slideshows come & go at will. Sometimes jumps to drug finder when trying to run slideshow. You send notification of story then can't read or find again.,
Anything and everything you want or need to know you can find here. From the medication you are taking to a diagnosis you've received. Any testing your Dr has asked for. But please do Not use this app in place of seeing your doctor. Always consult with a physician for any physical health problems you may be having. But this app is easy to use and very helpful.,
"If you dismiss a notification about a news story, it's nearly impossible to find it later. If you follow links out of the app to a website, you can't return easily to the same article within the app.",
You have got to be kidding me!! I have 30 years senior level healthcare administration experience and even I had no idea what some of the symptom nomenclature meant. I would have had to spend hours decoding the technical terminology relating to the questions. Do NOT attempt to use this app if you need fast answers or you are not a professional.,
"Useless app! What use is it when it doesnt specify all the diseases known to man. Found it useless when i searched for a common illness without any single result of my search. Moreover, you must choose the required number of illness before you complete your medical check. Nonsense! What use is it? Make a better service instead!",
Useless Symptom checker is completely broken and does not load any symptoms even when searching including for the word headache. This continues after restarting both the app and the phone. This was the only thing I use this app for so I guess I'm uninstalling it.,
"All that this app says it does, it truly does. However, as it requires Internet connection for anything you do, the app is not better than (and not worth having in place of) the website. Apps should have offline capabilities, else it's useless where there's website.",
I need a name of the Medi app review they say it will be a good drug to get some of my Allergies with Asthma both servere. I'm trying not to go to the hospital. I'm hoping to find out if I can find it here..,
"The explaining your symptoms is not as easy as just clicking on the body like before. I have been lower right side under my rib, and that is not an option and it doesn't even pop up. How I explain it does not mean the program explains it that. Please go back to the person",
"It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays",
"Less options for symptoms. I can't put a lesion inside the nose, or information like sores that haven't healed, or do not heal. Tingling in the eyelid, and so many other symptoms I can't put into it. Also, you can not rate your pain level anymore either. I'm not happy with the changes.",
Excellent articles. Easy to navigate. Pretty fast in terms of search results. I've sent posts to colleagues who also find them interesting too.,
"Very accurate suggestions if you can give multiple true symptoms. Then look up each potential suggested diagnosis they will list. Very helpful for me to use. Not just to read something that may confirm what I think I'm having, but can also eliminate the fear of what I think I might have.",
"no notifications from medication reminder? specifically updated notification settings and received notices the first day (Thursday) and today (Sunday) I'm realizing I missed a dose yesterday and I have not received any further reminders. 3x/day medication for 10 days, only notified two times on the first day of set up.",
Great source of information. Had to uninstall when they kept sending notifications about stories that I don't care about when all notifications were disabled. Not okay.,
"Permanent Email Spam. Literally sent hundreds of messages telling them to quit sending email. Regardless of the number of times you unsubscribe, or tell them to stop, these clowns continue to send it loads of messages. A situation I find completely unacceptable. So for me, it is pure trash.",
"Pretty good at diagnosing your top 5 most potential illnesses after a ""to the point"" question process. Not to be a replacement for going to a real doctor though! Also very considerate about ad placement... I ended up LOOKING for an ad to see who sponsors WebMD, to actively support their brands!",
Microphone permission in app preferences sparks the AI to pick up on keywords in all of your conversations outside the app. Thr articles are very tailored to what you may be going through though. EYE IN THE SKY! ü¶Ö,
"Half of my medications can't be found. I wanted to know the possible causes of extream foot pain (who my podiatrist isn't treating right, I am looking for a new one) and this app wanted to know my symptoms and meds. Because it couldn't find half the meds I take it thinks I have a blood clot in my legs which my pcp already ruled out. Completely useless.",
Awesome Love it so many great choices for everyone in all of the age groups parental discretion is advised some things are for adults only! Parents should supervise any children under the age of 18needs to have the option and opportunity to apply weather it's a child or adults to that's using the app so any apps can make sure that everything is advised and rated PG or adults only which ever the developer wants to apply these options and opportunities to keep our children under the age of 18 safe,
App was so glitchy I never got the chance to use it! Can't type. Can't click on things. No way to add or change information on your profile. It's like I was trying to use screenshots!,
"BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL, BY ITSELF, ALLERGY WIDGET!! YOU MOVED IT TO BUNDLE WITH THIS APP & YOU TOOK AWAY NEARLY ALL OF THE CUSTOM FEATURES. THE ALLERGY WIDGET THROUGH HERE IS GARBAGE. I CAN'T EVEN PICK AT WHAT LEVEL TO BE NOTIFIED - THIS ONE ONLY ALLOWS NOTICES WHEN LEVELS ARE HIGH. NOT MODERATE OR LOW. IT IS NOT COLOR CODED ANYMORE. THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THE FORMER, EXTREMELY CUSTOMIZABLE TRACKING. YOU TOOK THE BEST ALLERGY APP & MADE IT USELESS. (horoscopes, on WebMD? Seriously??) UNINSTALL.",
This is very helpful when you don't have good doctors and or even if you do you can better described to your doctor what's going on by studying this so it's a very amazing app and I'm very grateful that it was invented!,
"Awesome App. If I remember that's it's a tool and not an exact science,it's super helpful.Its NOT a unilateral site.Its a matter of fact site and thats a great thing to be.",
"It used to be helpful, now it doesn't have common rx listed or previous dx lists except for odd things. Doesn't have fibromyalgia listed, or thoracic symptoms. Anything that is back related is a joke. How many times are you going to tell me that my ruptured disk is most likely a pulmonary embolism. Maybe should be called Web Wet Nurse, definitely not MD anymore. Pitiful.",
Spent 45 mins putting in all of my symptoms just for them to ask me which one was bothering me the worst. & When i did i pressed next & at the top it said possible conditions & then i just seen white!! Literally no help at all! Im just going to see a doctor.,
The allergy screen is partially not visible. The ad screen seems to be in the way. Also it looks very plain and needs the different colors for the intensity of the pollutants and the map.,
"All the app keeps doing is giving me unfounded info about covid. Except for a few extremists and far out nuts, Most of the world is over it. This app used to be useful, but now every symptom seems to point to covid. That makes this app difficult to use because now you have to put a lot of thought into exact symptoms to get accurate results. No thanks!",
"The symptom checker doesn't work. It freezes and doesn't show any results for basic symptoms such as ""headache"" or ""weakness"". Uninstalled.",
"Could not Register, would not let me put in a password. I think the problem is that the word, password is staying there and when you put your password in the app is thinking there two passwords with a space between them",
"App has a medication reminder function, which is a great idea! It would be even better if one could actually SAVE THE REMINDER!!! Which I am unable to do.",
"I don't like this version of the app at all, it's clunky, more difficult to use, and isn't nearly as useful. The symptom checker is terrible. I want my previous version back :-(",
"It will not let me save articles ‚Äì gives the ""request failed"" error every single time ‚Äì then I'm not able to find or search the article later. Really irritating.",
The med reminder has helped me improve my med compliance. It's very helpful having each med listed separately. The app also gives great info about each med and side effects.,
There are Always health questions to be asked and confirmed. I love the WedMD app because it gives me the opportunity to research various illnesses that are forthcoming for a person of my age (65). I recommend others to utilize the site to learn about making important medical decisions.,
"Easy to find information and interesting articles. I liked the slide show of common pediatric and adult skin problems, as it is hard to remember what is what!",
I really like WebMD but I'm getting very frustrated with the fact that I keep getting notification alerts on my phone even though I've gone in and unchecked all of them. this is harassment so I guess I'll need to uninstall the app unless somebody tells me how to stop these notifications,
"I updated the app, but it won't open after 5 attempts. I tried uninstalling it and re-adding it, it still won't open two additional attempts.",
"""Factual information"" There's a list from A-Z that displays the names of various disease's known today. The app also allows you to type in and search your own personal physical symptoms and the informative responses can be very helpful for raising questions you may want to ask your doctor. On the down side tho and out of concern for others... ESPECIALLY the ones who are very ill physically mentally or both... PLEASE USE THIS ONLY AS A RESEARCH GUIDE! I think too much info can become easily misleading to someone who is vulnerable frightened and sick. Any questions asked on this app should also be taken to your doctor asap. This app clearly states... IT DOES NOT DIAGNOSE! God Bless you all!",
Use absolutely love using this app but since going to the new version (beta) nothing but bogus. I pick 5 symptoms and continuously keeps telling me to add at least one more symptom. Really? How many does a person need? I'll just uninstall.,
"Could be good, but spoiled by faulty notification function - which seems to come through even though they are switched off in the app setting!",
I am tired of trying to read an article of interest and having interruptions that change what am reading and I can't back to the original article. Either permit to read my article to it's end or I will remove this app.,
"please return to prevous version. new version has less information, medications and conditions to choose for symptoms. For a few months now I cannot get anything right. previously, this app was my #1 health information app.",
"It has some bugs here & there*, but overall it's great! 4out of 5 *(I am connected to the intenet, so i know this is a bug)on the Symptom Checker it won't show some of the medications that you take when you search for them & on the 'Drugs and Medications' button, if you added a medication to the 'My Drugs' tab then go to that tab and click on one of the medications you added, it'll prompt you with a message that says that you aren't connected to the Internet. TL:DR - then go back & read it...",
i could only enter one condition. for us baby boomers putting in a birthdate is very time consuming. i was only able to go back one month at a time. I've uninstalled this app.,
It good for the phone and Google did something to help people with a better life and lot of work in the website that people change and they will talk to the people who do the research and put a lot of heart into helping people with their own life to matter and hope the high school students in country can ask the teachers to hire them a nutrition teacher every other day in gym exercise day taught nutrition is important especial to women,
"Symptom checker changes are disappointing, and it's no longer very useful. Not sure why they removed the body map.",
I like the app. Love the emails they send me about health .and foods that are good. And foods in combo that helps you loose pounds.,
"Tried to use the symptom checker but I couldn't even enter knee pain as an option. All of the preselected options were covid-19 symptoms! If this is all that is offered, the symptom checker can be trashed.",
I installed the app originally with a health related question. Every day there is ten notifications that are not related at all to me. Getting rid of this nuisance.,
Very handy. Keep track of your meds and do a quick checklist to see if your contagious or not. Definitely recommend this app.,
I had this app when I had to unfortunately reset my phone. I have tried to reinstall it 8 times. I was advised I needed to make room ( there was plenty of room) I'm very sorry that I had to look elsewhere for the app that was closest to this one.,
"Honestly, I miss the old symptom checker. It seemed to be more accurate. This new form says (Over Exaggeration) that I died 7 years ago. I know nothing beats a living breathing medical professional, but none happen to be open today (Sunday) with out going to ER. In my profession, Saturday and Sunday are just days when no one's around.",
"WebMD should be ashamed of getting rid of the person symptom checker. I had pain on the left side of pelvis that I could not specify by typing in, the results did not specify which side. Additionally, I preferred the person symptom checker (gasp!,imagine that). As a company, you should consider giving your consumers options rather unilaterally removing features that some prefer. Removing app and will use alternative sites in the future.",
"I like the allergy info, but the constant ""don't forget to take your medication"" notification is ridiculous. Just give me the allergen notification I asked for. Some people don't take a pill for every single thing and those that do need allergy meds should know to take them based on their doctor's Rx, not an internet app.",
"Having pain in abdomen, and lower back, can't stand or sit for more than 2 minutes, was told maybe kidney stones, but the pain is at lower back as if something pushes on nerves when standing or sitting up",
"If I was able to score it more then what I did, it would definitely deserve it. This is a very special app that is worth any time you have to search in it. I am Grateful to have installed it. Thank you",
"This is one of the most helpful apps that I have ever installed on my phone, the most complete and reliable also accurate information about health, medicine, drugs etc, you could ever find online is here!",
Never asked you to send me notifications about articles. Not ones in interested in... let alone random ones. I don't appreciate my time being wasted for your advertising. Here's your 1 star for the rain clouds on my day.,
Helps you narrow down the possibilities so you can sleep better....because you put that hypochondriac inside you in its proper place. You can even locate a physician to communicate with. Great app.,
"It's a good source of information to research so you can speak more accurately, ask more informed questions and get better medical treatment if everyone involved, including the patient, can communicate.",
"If you tap on the map, box pops up about ""no data, choose another place"" - but you can't choose another place by tapping and have to restart the phone to get rid of the message box.",
"Good but needs more functionality. How can this app replace WebMD Allergy when there is no ability to capture conditions, symptoms, and treatment? Please tell me you are adding that capability before the allergy app goes away.",
"Terrible, antique nutrition advice. Articles are mistitled to sound controversial when the article is not in any way controversial or about the title at all. This place reminds me of the National Enquirer slanted so badly they can barely even get the facts right.",
Helps. Not always consistant though and i wish i could save and label the session so dont have to reenter all symptoms again justbto add 1 or 2 more.,
"A year ago I used this app because i felt terrible. It said I had adrenal insufficiency, I went to the doctors and they said it was nothing, that I was extremely healthy.. a week ago I used it because of a stomach bug and when I went to the hospital, this app was correct. They also diagnosed me with adrenal insufficiency, which this app had suggested and my doctors disagreed.. i wish the doctors had listened a year ago and could have prevented those symptoms that made me lose everything",
"This app was referred to help log my blood pressure, but I saw no option for that. What I did find is a constant request for my PIN and the app kept crashing every time I hit the Doctors button",
Very useful app that contain insightful topics of information in health and so on. It's great app to read and learn from all the different subjects.,
"The Symptoms checker needs a lot of work. I tried different symptoms. All i got was buritis, septicemia, and line sepsis. That got me scared as heck when those illness came up. Glad I tried different symptoms. Nonetheless anything is fine.",
"I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you. Notifications disabled",
"Prefer the app Just between me and the wall, I want a simple widget to show me what I need to know. Stop shoving a plethora of useless 'info' in my face! Link the app to your widget!",
This is a great app to have on hand. Easily look up illnesses at your finger tips. Get answers or find question to ask your doctor at your apptments to get a clear understanding of you situation.,
WebMD is ok if all you want to do is check you prescriptions. I was trying to use the Symptom checker and the app would not accept any symptom that I tried to enter. I tried four symptoms and the app acted like i entered none.,
The medicine cabinet was great but it gone from the desk top and mobile app. It was a great tool. Please bring it back.,
"I've had issues finding general common symptoms, such as just General body aches, and can't even find drugs by their brand names such as Vistaril (Hydroxyzine). Anything I can find on the app I can EASILY find elsewhere in MUCH greater detail.",
Your app used to be more accurate in describing and identifying issues in the symptom checker. Now it's just vague and not helpful. Your app is worthless.,
Entered required info. When I came back it was gone. Entered required info again. When I came back it was gone. Texted devs twice. No response in 2 weeks. Uninstalled.,
"Very helpful to get general information for a starting point of research into medical and health issues. Also, interesting articles.",

The thing is: I Love WebMD articles and information I find on their site And in their magazine. I actually have a WebMD sitting on the table next to me. When I decide if I am going to download an app, I read All the information provided by the developer, all the permissions, and I read Many of the reviews. The information provided to me sounded awesome. Yep, good app for me, I'm thinking. Plus WebMD is a great site and magazine.

Not nearly as good as the website.,

Last update took away some of the features I think they should be returned... Thank you,
Always a great source of information,
Great app gives me my daily information I find useful.,
Most excellent and resourceful medical app,
Way off. Nowhere near accurate.,
I enjoy the way articles are presented.,
it's hard to search for anything like the olap,
"It makes complex issues easy to understand. Removes anxiety related to health issues from readers by explaining how the problem manifests itself, then explains solutions.",
thought it would be great but it seems that they want to know more about me. I'm not applying for a job.,
The older bersion was easier to use.,
Always good information that is very helpful,
Very helpful and easy to use.,
Great service i use it often for me and my clients,
very helpful app with good UI,
This is such an app for info on medical anything. Including identifying pills that you find in your cabinet and can't remember or know what it is.,
Easy to use and helpful üëå,
Too hard to open up. Ridiculous for a so called information site!,
Unable to set up account due to Parsing error- what is that?,
Favorable & educational.,
Used to be a good app. for looking up meds but is just useless now,
Best medical reference book available!!!,
Stopped working after last update...7/28/20,
Used the app several times for informative content,
i like the web site better. the app runs me in circles.,
great ap. l Like the informative articles.,
I absolutely love this app! It is very informative!,
Informative and concise,
It helps me to determine from symptoms the nature of an ailment and also to discover possible side effects of different medications.,
kept telling me I have corona virus and have to go see the doctor when all I have is lowblood and sore throat from smoking.,
can't add symptoms and nothing comes up for what it could be. it won't even let me type anything in.,
Helpful and informative.,
Excellent service and super fast prescription was ready at CVS before I got there,
Excellent and very resourceful!!,
Complete trash. I type in painful numb swollen feet the only suggestions you offered was swollen testicles what the heck,
WebMD always gives me the information I am looking for and more!,
Incredible stories about life events. Always has a wealth of health news.,
Great articles daily!,
Provides very useful information that has helped me make more informed decisions,
My meds change sometimes and it's good to know about side effects,
good app on health and it's related information. one should have this app .,
Drugs search response is late please.. please improve it. make it faster like in medscape,
Great website!! Very helpful!!,
Used to be a great tool but is nearly worthless now.,
Very helpful and informative. Thumbs up,
Very informative health care app,
Helpful n easy to look up app love it,
Good starting point for medical issues.,
Cannot sign up... Shows error,
I Love WebMD: The App Has Help Me Out Tremendously!,
"Go to site for reliable, medical and health-related information",
Very useful.. a must download for everyone,
Helps to make a list to ask doctor at office visit. Use it as a tool to check symptoms and identifying pills.,
Great app also has a pill identifier in app.,
As a mom it is the perfect guide.,
"Now completely useless... Uninstalling.. Bye, bye!",
"The app contains clear lucid explanations of medicines, uses, doses, side effects, & contraindications.",
its great healp in the medicine deace help but somthi g is do iprovement accoding to diease medicine including,

good discriptions of diseases & treatments,
Set up is a bit user friendly,
Good source of medical information.,
Educationally informative / smart reading,
Good articles regarding health!,
"Very informative, excellent information",
You are pushing untrue facts. There is no useful need for children to wear masks indoors or outdoors. Stop with your false narratives!! If I could give a negative rating I would butnthe app will not allow that. WebMD deserves a negative 90 due to giving out false information in the form of medical advise. Telling everyone that Ivermectin can land you in the hospital is ludicrous and a down right lie!!! In 30 years there have only been 19 adverse reactions to Ivermectin.,
This is an exceptional app. Great information.,
Sucks. Download here. Click. Your download will begin later. Add to other devices? No. Enter password. wrong password (just created 5 minutes ago). Your download will begin later...,
Inappropriate adverts. Bad if child clicks on it. Said 18+,
Great info and great articles,

This app is quite informative and helpful.,
Really outdated looking.,
Always hot on the medical topic.,
"App is full of trackers, I just uninstalled it.",
Excellent application. I love it for the public,
"Extremely convinient, saving time.",
I like the peace of mind that we'd md gives me when I need to identify a pill. I'm always dropping pills and when I'm done cleaning I always wonder is this what I think. So I look it up and vala mind teashurred. Thanks WebMd,
Nice and easy to use,
love this app! Easy to use. thank you!,
I enjoy using this app. It can be very informative.,
Informative and resourceful,
"It's Ok, but Pill finder needs more options...",
great to have as a reminder to take medicatiin,
Birth date to hard to put in..... Back space month over 12 time then by over 50 to get it down to birth year,

There is no mention of weight gain from Carbamezepine with Trigeminal Neuralgia patients.,

I don't see why I should leave this on if only going be for United States and Canada.,

this is a very helpful app i use it all the time.,
The medication reminders are working any more,
almost always spot on.,
Most Authentic Health App.... Highly recommend.,
I was looking for the body so i could point to where it hurts.,
Very informative and in depth symptom identifier to diagnose problem.,
"""As a Healthcare Professional, It is highly recommended to have it as a go-to.""",
Won't say anything to help so what's the point?,
Spend time entering in symptoms and then it locks up.,
Thanks for my daily propaganda update.,
Mostly it was sensational.,
All my medications are listed twice can fig how to edit list.,
Facilities the learning,
simple to use.,
To much repeating of information not wanted.,
I love this app i use it all the time it is amazing,
very useful content,
This is to me that it doesn't give full accurate reading though then when you tell symptoms then Dr look then throw you out of the hospital or whatever then it becomes a bigger problem and called (explicit) and (explicit) meaning then being mean then don't work with you then screw everything up then beaten up do to your body AdA and homosexual lifestyle then to near hurt you and fraud the Medicare for then I am screwed to point that it's oil and water then it doesn't work anymore,
I really thought the sopposly dr at this site was legit. Wrong. Stop spreading lies about covid and delta. It's a scare tactic,
Great app! Never not found what I was looking for,
Haven't seen it working enough tp give a great rating.,
"Suggested conditions don't make sense, there are no matches to any symptoms.",
It's a handy tool to understand health related issues.,
easy as pie and then some!!!,
The amount of false information is a disappointment. You are no longer a medical helper but a disgrace to We the people.,
doesn't have anything useful for me to describe my symptoms. didn't like it,
when i look for medicine it asked for my personal info. it got updated to the worst,
Very informative app.,

Love the site . Very useful.,
Symptom checker won't let me search for symptoms,
Great helper.. specially drugs interference,

Clear and accurate,
Love WebMD; for they have the best human technology to describe any type of feeling! Thank you WebMD,
Easy to use no cost,
Good source of information,
The perfect information source I need for my book project,
This app is a wonderful . Tons of knowledgeable information.,

Amazing app and company!,
"Just remind yourself that you need it, Try something new and remarkable today, So you can be proud of yourself the other day.",
Sux wont even add multiple symptoms,
Outstanding app for medical knowledge,
Have used Web MD for years. Very informative.,
very good for professional,
App is worthless. Go to an actual doctor.,

Greatest app out of them all,
WebMD is the best as far as I'm concerned,
My first go to reference for quick medical advice.,
Good App !! On Today's 21 Century Modern World !! üëç üòá üëÄ,
Seems very accurete. I recomend it.,
Always useful in time of need.,
"WebMD is sharing information which is misleading, but mostly completely false. They shared a story about people becoming sick from taking animal ivermectin. Multiple doctors from the reported hospitals have come forward to discount these reports. One ER doc has said they have had NO patients admitted for overdosing on animal grade ivermectin. The medical community is covering for vaccine companies because if there are proven treatment regimes for a virus, the vaccine company loses their EUA.",
This is a great app informative as well,
Great info articles!,
Always get the straight scoop,
Not updated info couldn't even look up loratadine no search for oblong shaped pills,
"WORLDS ONE OF THE BEST MEDICINE WEBSITE , FRIENDLY AND USABLE. BUT IN INDIAN CONTEXT IT IS BECOME DIFFICULT TO USE THIS METERIA MEDICA. BECAUSE THIS WEBSITE IS BASED ON ZENERIC NAME ,BUT INDIAN PHARMA COMPANIES DO NOT CARE ABOUT THIS.",
The numbers are exaggerated so more people think it's more safe to take the vaccine,
When I need to research medication this is good place,
Great source of information,
Excellent start for questions,
Bookmarking of artical is not upto the mark,

Very good information.,
Probably the least helpful app I've ever used,
This app sucks it dosent go into details when asking questions at all.,
Your COVID19 guidance is all over the place. How can anyone trust this information or even yet make sense of it,
It should have a better symptoms checker.,
"Can't get it to work been trying for 2 days now I give up , by.",
Two stars: Receiving cookies is non-negotiable.,
All these suggestions are wonderful,
The pill identifier does not include the manufacturer? How useless can you make this?,
of course its not a dr. but it gives you some reason,
"Use it for that pesky ""Did you bring a list of your meds today?"" As a matter of fact I did!!",
Great app very informative,

"One of my fave apps. Ive used this for 5+ years. The symptom checker is awesome and extremely helpful. I love the update that made reading on particular topics a choice. You can select topics of interest (ex. Digestive Health, Mental Health, Pain Management, Cancer, Aging, Parenting, etc. ) I enjoy the news alerts also. They arent excessive or annoying.",
I like the previous update better.,
excelent,
Very knowledgeable. Helps with info in plain language when you need it. Thanks!,
"Love this app! My ""Go To"" for medical understanding on my level!",
No complaints so far. I like it.,
"Use this allot, flawless, good info...",

Good app,

Fine,
I use to love this app. Now they've updated it and it doesn't recognize my medications. The symptom checker is awful now too. You apparently need to be fluent in professional medical terms to use it. Good luck trying to find simple symptoms. Doesn't have the detailed questions about each symptom anymore so it doesn't really give you an accurate answer. Just please go back to the old way.,
"I used to love this app. It had options of pointing to different parts of the body or would give a drop down list. This new version only displays 5 items in the main screen, so you have to search for the symptoms. In the old app it also gave a percentage of likelyhood that you have that ailment- something this version entirely skipped. To top it all off, they no longer recognize my medications. In summary, the app would be great if they got rid of the Beta version and went back to the original-or gave you the option to do so. Very disappointed.",
App is very useful for different uses. From understanding your health issues to learning new medical topics and etc. App is a great help with misc topics. Although the app has a hard time loading news articles often.,
I liked the other one better where you could pick which part of the body. This new one not useful as it is.,
"This is really up to date, it give you a lot of info about the meds you are looking for. I cannot do without it! Thank you Web MD.",
I try to look up the easiest things and they can't be found. I have used Webmd for what feels like forever and I at one point gave them 5 stars. They've gone down.,
This app has always been helpful when looking up health information and guidance.,
I hate the new symptom checker it's absolutely useless,
Has very little information in search,

Useless app. Delete...,
this is a wonderful app,

Works well,
"I been a regular user of the site version for a long time. Was so excited 
when i discovered there was an app version. So I downloaded it n loved it. 
Well that was until the latest update when webmd wants to know everything 
under the sun about me n my cell etc. They dont need all that info n seems 
like a violation of my and other users privacy. Soooo not cool. I won't be 
updating the app unless they issue another update where they dont want so 
much access n info. I may have to delete app if no change.",
"Used to be good with selecting body areas but now its too general and tells 
me my symptoms are diabetic coma or pms. When i look at the symptoms i only 
have one thing out of all the ones for both of those. And my issues have 
been going on alot longer. Im also not diabetic. The old app was alot 
better and was more accurate. This is very disappointing",
"HATE the new Beta symptom checker. Instead of having convenient categorized 
lists to make identifying symptoms easier, you have to know the applicable 
verbage already. So many of the previous symptoms seem impossible to find 
now, and there seem to be no follow up questions on severity or type of 
pain anymore. So now it's a lot harder to accurately depict my pain and 
figure out if it's a simple muscle strain, a sprain, or a hairline fracture.",
"When I did have this APP THEY would not allow me to add another reminder 
for the same medication, just a different milligram of it. I feel they 
really need to do a lot of work on there program. Now they won't let me add 
in the correct medication with the correct milligrams or much of anything 
else!!!!!!",
Used to work. Now imposible to scroll. Symptom analysis totally useless. Uninstalling. Total waste of memory space!,
Symptom checker doesn't recognize my symptoms. Makes it useless to me.,
"Just saved my life ,symptoms checked out and went to E R saved my life",
I always use this app very helpful,
Very helpful and informative. Easy to use. Recommend.,
Very helpful,
Good,
Excellent,
"Don't like the new look. Miss being able to select body area and answer 
questions. The old way made me feel more comfortable with if I should seek 
immediate attention or not. This feels too general and doesn't seem to give 
guidance that it once offered. Very disappointing.",
"It tells you what you need to know. Since this app has changed over the 
yrs, I can't see the diagram of the body any longer. Where's the older app 
to this one? You used to have everything from a to z in here. But now it's 
gone. Can you give me some direction as to where I can find the older Web 
MD?",
"Loved it, until the update. The new symptom checker is useless. Please 
bring the old one back.",
"Sends notifications that I never chose to receive. I'm tired of business 
that think its acceptable to 'do now, ask forgiveness later.' Also the 
symptom checker is narrow minded compared to the web version.",
"I love webmd because it let's me store my meds list for when I see my 
doctor and I lookup my new meds. For side effects comes in handy.",
"Since they screwed up the symptom checker, my review will be lower. It's 
pretty much worthless now.",
"Had only one of my 9 medication, missing a lot of symptoms/past conditions 
in the symptom checker as well.",
"I hate the new update. Bring back the old way of clicking on the body and 
the app asks you questions. This way is awful.",
"I loved this app got a long time. But after reading others reviews, I am 
happy to see I'm not along in my dislike after the latest update. Not to 
mention the many crashes.",
"The app has bugs, even if symptoms are added it still doesnt proceed to 
next and displays "" enter atleast one symptom""",
"Ever since the app was updated, it's no good. Much prefer it the other way 
where you are able to zoom in.",
"I loved this app until you changed the symptom checker. I want the figure 
of the body back and/or a list of symptoms. If it's not changed I'm going 
to uninstall.",
"Previous symptoms checking option was much better with photo and graphic 
animation. Please bring that back.",
"Used to love this app! But the new symptoms checker is stupid! Bring back 
the other version where you could pick the location on the body! It made it 
a lot easier!",
"Symptom checker symptom list is gone. List of conditions jumps up and down 
roughly and violently as you're scrolling. App needs immediate fixes!",
"The new version is useless. How is something as common as a rash not in 
symptom checker? I've had it for years and it was a great tool until your 
new Beta.",
"Dont like the new look, it was easier before the update when you could 
choose the area on the body",
"Non-invasive Venilation is something that should be added as a treatment 
for COPD.",
"Loved it, until this verson update. - _- apparently wrinkled fingers is a 
sign of Autism instead of dehydration, how strange. Makes me question their 
sources, are they sponsored (i.e. Biased)!?!!",
Not very good. Doesn't even have diphenhydramine.,
"Why does this app need access to my contacts, phone, location etc...? Why 
does the title says Home not WebMD. Hate this kind of daylight scam.",
Don't like the new app at all,
Old is best but new is not useful!,
"Very informative, good medical information",

"I recently suffered something called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome and 
this app has absolutely no info about it. Someone suffering from that would 
not be able to find any answers about what's happening to them and the most 
dangerous thing is that you need to quit smoking pot to make it stop but 
folk would try to use pot to ease the symptoms. Update this app so it has 
current info about serious issues.",
"LATEST UPDATE RUINED IT!!! The Symptom Checker was SO much better when you 
could point to the area of the body in question. Now you have to write down 
& describe your symptoms & that just doesn't work for me. Now seeking 
alternative app.",
"I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS APP AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE IM SURE IT HAS SAVED LIFE'S 
THANK YOU CAROL OBRIEN",
"Layest version is way worse than the previous one. A lot of the 
functionality was removed. Horrible update and it is a beta too. I removed 
it from the phone and looking for alternative.",
"Latest update made it worthless. Formerly able to use the body diagram to 
point and describe symptoms. Now you have to try add describe via text 
that's provided in a list. Useless",
"Bring back the clickable body for symptom checker, that's all I used it for 
so I'm deleting. Also too many random irrelevant notifications I didn't ask 
for.",
"I HATE the new symptom checker. Lacks the ability to detail symptoms like 
the old version did",
"The changes to the symptom checker tool have made it incredibly difficult 
to use. Very unhappy. Bring back the body chart which was much more user 
friendly.",
"I hate the new symptom checker! The old one was much easier to navigate and 
had more specific symptoms. It seems more like a downgrade than an upgrade!",
"Those of us in the southern hemisphere don't really need to be notified 
about common summer health issues, such as poison ivy exposure, etc. - it's 
nearly winter, & I don't even think we have poison ivy in this country.",
"It was much easier to use when you picked out parts of the body and the 
symptoms you're having. Now you can't even find anything hardly for 
symptoms of know what your symptoms are labeled under in the symptoms 
checker.",
"I set the app to remind me when to take my meds at 1715 (5:15pm). It worked 
for few days, then it began to remind me to take them at random times, even 
while in the same time zone. So I deleted it, then reinstalled it. Not 
going to use it as a reminder anymore.",
"I downloaded this for the symptom checker but it is all but useless in it's 
current format. Deleting it.",
"The only problem with this app is that content is not textual! You can not 
copy text to research it further or to translate it.",
"What were you thinking when changing the symptoms checker? I HATE this new 
layout. It's difficult to navigate, confusing to try and use, and very 
frustrating. Didn't give hardly any results and couldn't easily find more 
info on anything. Please, at least let us have to use the human figure 
layout and your old website version...",
"An excellent app for health conscious people. Very informative and easy to 
use. Would recommend this app to everyone.",
I use it to confirm my diagnosis and it serves it's purpose well.,
"What ever happened to the conditions you used to able to access offline 
please bring that back it was really helpful thankyou",
"Please downgrade the minimum age to 10. Thanks. Overall: 10/10 would use 
again.",
It doesn't recognize all medications,
Please bring back the old symptom checker.,
This app is best for drugs knowledge,
"Disabled all notifications within the app settings and continued getting 
notifications about news stories I don't care about. Uninstalling.",
Excellent App! Great information!!,
Very useful,
Good,
"New permissions added without explanation, which this company has a history 
of doing. And just like in the past, when questioned about it, they provide 
a useless response and no real answer. They clearly don't care about users 
or their privacy.",
"I used to love this app. I don't like the new beta symptom checker, and 
wish there was an option to use the former one. This new one is way too 
vague.",
"I have used this app for years and loved it. Now it has been updated and 
removed little man that helped me find possible reasons for my discomfort. 
The change is okay maybe if you are a doctor.",
"I hate the new layout of this app. I like the old style with the Symptom 
Checker and layout of the body",
Very informative,
"Needs a section for nutritional supplements. Also, when clicking for 
information on a topic or drug, it says nothing but ""ask your doctor"". More 
stars if these strong shortcomings are rectified.",
"5 stars before the update. The new symptom checker does not give enough 
options to choose from. Also, when I did choose a symptom it gave me a 
wacko result that didn't make any sense. Please undo the update it is not 
user friendly. Disappointed.",
"The symptom is now STUPID. The anatomy scale each easier to use with many 
more symptom options. The new one is very inept, lacking, and not as easy 
to use.",
Hate the new update. Bring back the body map! It was much easier to use.,
"Disappointing that I downloaded the app only to discover that the touch 
anatomy function seems to be missing.",
"Since they changed the symptom checker, it is hard to navigate and not user 
friendly.",
"Bring back the old symptom checker, the new one is completely unusable",
The older symptom checker with the body was better this new version sucks.,
Great App,
"It is bad when a pain management patients get labeled as addicts because 
they take pain meds, yet you can't add all your medical history or meds 
history.",
"The new system is awful. It's harder to use and find anything I am looking 
for",
"This was the best app of it's kind until the new update. Absolutely useless 
now. So disappointing",
"I tried pill identifier, that app doesn't work and is awful. I love this app",
"This used to be a good app but they changed symptom checker to a list that 
doesn't help at all! Change it back to the original one with the body as a 
checker not a stupid list.",
"This new symptoms checker is more difficult to follow. It's over 
generalized now.",
"I don't like the new version of the symptom checker. I prefer the old one 
with the outline of the human body that you could use to point out what was 
wrong. That was more helpful.",
"Great information at the touch, savining time to ER or Dr's office. Thanks 
again!",
"OMG!!! I LITERALLY HATE this new update, the symptom checker ABSOLUTELY 
sucks now",
"Where did the anatomy part go? That was the best thing ever. Please bring 
it back. Let us choose if we want to search our symptoms based off the 
anatomy checker or typing in the sumptoms.",
"great app so far, have been using web version for a while!",
Don't like the new symptom checker it's not as good as it once was,
The new symptom checker is useless.,
Great app. Use it for the whole family!,
Too many notifications and ads that start when I open my phone,
This app is very informative!,
Very informative app.,
Extremely helpful.,
Best app,
Just installed,
"It used to be really helpful until they updated it to whatever awful 
version it is now. And by taking a quick look at the newest reviews, I'm 
not the only one who thinks so. If webmd values the people who have 
installed their app, and wants people to continue using it, then they need 
to revert to the old version asap. I'm deleting it if they don't.",
"They are testing a new layout for symptom checker. I like the theory behind the new layout, and once they work out the kinks. They desperately need to review/expand the medication and past conditions lists. There are common/older medications not listed, medications misspelled, and common conditions not listed.",
"Med reminder adherence percentage keeps dropping even though I took every 
dose on time and recorded it.",
"You need to put medical test report analyzer in this app..so peoplr could 
easily know about their blood test...and also you should make it so one can 
put his results of more than one type of test report result and check his 
overall by analyzing all their value",
"Use to like this app a lot but the symptom checker was so much better 
before, it asked you symptoms you might not have thought of.",
Symptom checker is junk. You can't put anything into it. And since when does shoulder pain equal type 1 diabetes!! I also have a few choice words that I'm keeping quiet about this app.,
"Changed the symptom checker and now it sucks. Uninstalled until it changes 
back or gets leaps and bounds better.",
"Preferred old symptoms checker with diagram and check list of symptoms 
present. New system sucks trying to describe every detail, enter every Rx 
and many current conditions absent from list to enter. This review is for 
Beta version.",
The new symptom checker doesn't work. It only allows the preselected symptoms to be used and doesn't allow you to search any. It also doesn't load any possible conditions when you put in your symptoms. Not worth it,
This app could be great but it needs a little tlc. Looking forward to updates and updated speed,
This is an absolute must have app for me & many others as well! THANX!!,
New design sucks. Lost sight of the end user's needs.,
Can't remove notifications...Everyday a new one shows up.,
It ovwrloads you with posts umpteen times per day. And no options to control the number or frequency of their posts.,
"I can't even find the symptoms I am having because it has a small list pre-made but when I try to search symptoms it doesn't let me actually search, it only let's me type it in and then that's it.. So I'm gonna say honestly this isn't anything good compared to the old app. You should change it back to where people can actually use it lol",
"Useless. I preferred to use the old version with the visual model where you could select the exact area affecting the symptoms. Simply searching pain doesn't even bring it close to what I'm looking for, for example I can't select pain in the right hand of my chest/lower ribs or back.",
The new update to the symptom checker is completly unhelpful. It looks new but completly time wasting trying to figure out what the symptoms are labeled under.,
"I agree with everyone else on here. The new symptom checker is really bad. The old one was useful, especially when you can't describe the symptom, which is quite often for myself haha. On the old one, I also quite liked the fact it would give you questions about your symptoms after you have pinpointed what your symptoms are.",
I miss the old way it use to be when all u had to do was to tap on what body part that is in pain. The new version makes it a little frustrating.,
I do not like the updated version of this because it was a hell of a lot easier to choose symptoms rather than trying to type them in and hoping that's what your symptom is.,
"It was more effective before the changes to the app where made, less symptoms are listed, there is no body map for picking symptoms, and the disease list is more inaccurate",
The app was better when you could enter more symptoms and when there was a body to identify where you were experiencing problems.,
UPDATE SUCKS!!  You had ONE job and you SCREWED it up.  RIP Symptom Checker,
This app was a thousand times better when you could point to the specific body part and get really specific about your symptoms. You guys really got rid of a good thing. This app did not help me at all.,
"The new symptom checker is awful!!! You can't find a any symptoms, even when you type them. The old way with the body where you click on certain parts was much better.",
Update ruined the app. You can no longer select the body parts,
Very  helpful! Love this app! Iam very happy to have this app in my cel !,
"I rather have the old version.  Where are all the symptoms it used to have?  I put in a symptom and it doesn't bring up anything related.  Also, bring back the body map....bring back the old version.",
Do not like the new symptom checker.  Get rid of it.,
Please bring back the old version,
This used to be my go to app. It has helped me learn about different medical conditions and treatments. The symptom checker has helped many people I know decide whether or not to go to the er or doctor. But the new update is going to make me lose interest in the app.,
This app used to be more user friendly. Symptom Checker was a lot easier before,
The update ruined this app why?!?! Was great apps tell then!,
New version sucks,
"It is a reasonable reference for most things but the interface could be better.  Navigation within the app is clunky and confusing sometimes.  The visual interface needs to be sectioned into quadrants and the yes/no questions are vague at best. Needs to also incorporate a ""are you also experiencing"" for certain symptoms like if you select ""nasuea"" it should ask about dizziness etc.",
"This is the most informative,  and easiest app to use for all types of info ... it is always my go to app for medical, personal health, and nutrition questions.",
I found what i need here like health rekated issue's. app is designed very simple  to use and information are really very usefull.,
Great for symptom checking. Gets you thinking in the right direction usually.  Prescription drug checking and interaction checks are a great benefit.,
Very  helpful and informative. It just keeps getting better. I like that it has a place to track medicine and a reminder. It. Helps me keep track of which ones I'm allergic to or have bad affects.,
It won't let me sign on tells me screen name does not exist I had gotten an a few times but now no very upsetting guess I'll look for another website that will want my business,
"This app is an essential for my smartphone. It's informative,  trustworthy, and accessible for heath issues.",
"I haven't even been using the app and it's been running in the background doing who knows what, keeping my phone awake, and draining even more battery than the apps I DO use.",
"HATE this new version!  I cannot find the right symptoms, very short and useless list. Bring back the old version!",
"The symptom checker feature is nice, but the news updates need work. The 
stories come in on my notifications and when I click on one I'm interested 
in, they take me to a different random news article. So frustrating!",
Webmd is the best! Tell me when 2 take my meds & has a world of info on health issues that pertain 2 me!,
Explanations for illnesses and health in general are easy to understand. I refer to this app at least 4 or 5 times a week. Grandma's are supposed to know all the answers if someone is sick of course.,
"It okay, gives me an idea of what could be wrong and what to tell the doctor.",
very useful app. when looking up symptoms and medications.  highly recommend this app.,
"I have recently started using the medication reminder and it works 
perfectly for my vitamins and minerals taken during the day.",
Very useful for the quick reference of symptoms and possible treatments. Not to be used as a Doctor replacement.,
"Love it,it tells me just want I need to know!",
"I love using this app only when I need too, it gives good advice, plus I love the remedies that you have a home if it's only a virus only. It saves me $$$ a doctor bill. Thank you. :)",
Uses far too much battery even when turned off!,
"Easy to use ,accurate medical info, And helps a person make better informed medical decisions",
I use it on daily basis extremely helpful for my family and me.,
I have used the app off and on for several years and I have always found the information I was looking for.,
Has helped me over 20 + years of information with medications and diagnosis for entire family and friends.,
Excellent source of information that is easily understood. Great job..WebMD.,
The most credible source for a medical diagnosis apart from going to the doctor.,
I like symptoms checker and ilnesses.,
Easy app to use and easy to understand with good health information.,
Very helpful.  I use it all the time!,
It keeps me informed and untop of my health!,

"I'm disabled and have a hard time remembering to do things a lot so this  isn't just great st reminding me of important things I have to remember but reminds me to take my medications.  And, my favorite feature is that I can jot down all that I may experience before my next appointment and take pictures of what I can so I don't have to explain myself over and over.  Plus It really helps doctors give a diagnosis quicker without any time wasted on wrong diagnosis created from lack of seeing the conditions and side effects take place and leaving out things so easily forgotten.",

I like this app because it lets you look up medical queries and offer news reports on the latest trends in medicine.,

"I enjoy this app because I can review health issues wherever I am, and knowing the information is accurate and reliable",

Very understang,
I believe the information to be trustworthy and informative but it often leaves me asking for more. Maybe some questionnaires of some types would be able to give more personalized and detailed answers.,
Works Great. I am surprised it is free. Has lots of medical information. Rate 100%,
Tells me all I want to know.,
political bias and poor quality and selection of stories.,
Very Informative...,
Actually is good,
"This App needs to Quit asking me to Rate it. I already had, and I gave it a 5 Star and a great review. But just about every time I open it up the Anoyying please Rate shows up.  So now I have down graded it to 3 stars and this. , ask me again and I'll drop it to 1 star. Plain and simple.",
"I use it all the time. I wouldn't use it as much as I do if I didn't love it. I use it to look up prescription adverse reactions, interactions with both prescription and OTC medications, and to see what causes a symptoms. It's embarrassing, but recently used it to see why I was having severe pain in my chest. It was simply gas. A huge gulp of cool coke and a huge burp later and all was well! Saved me a trip to the ER!",
"I absolutely LOVE WebMd. üíñ I do, however, think that the emails pile up.  I don't want to stop receiving them; however,  receiving them a little less frequently would be good.  The information provided is so useful and very educational.  I do save the information after I read it. I used to bookmark it or save to desktop; or the home screen on my phone, which I'd place in a WebMd designated folder on my phone or on my pc.  It seems that the design, now, only allows sharing--which allows emailing...  maybe texting.. I'm not sure.  I sometimes share the info with others via email.  I was emailing it to myself; however, since that is not my preference of how to save it for myself, I now, close the webpage and simply save the original email in a WebMd folder I created.  I really preferred the option to bookmark after I opened up the topic; or save the topic page to my desktop to place in a designated folder; or I'd save the topic page on my phone's homescreen to place in the designated folder.  Having said all this.. It could be that it's the app design.  I open the email and it looks like I'm reading straight from the web; however, when I'm closing out, I see the app, just before I get back to the email to close it out.  I love WebMd.  I've used WebMd as a medical source for information for many years; long before there was an app.  I think having the app is good.. to have to open as a shortcut to vital information.  Having things the way it is when going straight to the website's URL is great, too.  Some change is good; but I feel it's better and in some ways, more convenient to leave what works well... to work well.  Thank you, very much, WebMd for sharing very vital, significant, and very helpful information with us.",
Very useful health related information at the finger tip instantly. Thanks for informing us on most relevant and latest updates on health issues everyone should know.,
"Absolutely useless. Spent 45 minutes inputting my medication list on my laptop, then installed the app on my phone. It lists the medication but DOES NOT SHOW THE DOSE OR TIME OF DAY FOR DOSE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!",
"Very useful app for identifying symptoms. But I recommend to follow up with a doctor. It also provides useful news in medicine, health, and healthy tips.",
"I love this I love this app it's a very fantastic app it gives us too much 
knowledge about medical science. But tell me one thing how can I get a 
connection with the medical doctors online...",
I enjoy learning about common maladies that might impact different parts of the body. It helps me to ask more informed questions of my physicians.,
I Love this app. Lots of great information and ideas. I believe if you would pay attention to it. You could live a healthier life,
"Been using since it's inception. Please make more clearly. Which are genuine articles, uposed to advertising. It can make a large difference in advice.",
"Easy-to-use. I know everyone says WebMD makes them think they are sicker than they really are, but it usually puts me at ease.",
The health information is very easy to use and goes  into alot of detail. I also like the symptom checker .,
"This is one of my go to site that I go to to gather information.  The information that I find on this site helps me to articulate my questions and concerns better, when speaking to my physican",
Its like having your own personal doctor with you at all times.  But provides you with better up to date information.  Awesome app.,
Informative and helpful.  Do not like so many slide show and quiz formats on topics that I would prefer to read quickly.,
"I am grateful for the comprehensive information provided on medications.  However, I can't vouch for the accuracy & reliability of data provided because source is not identified.  I am trusting that it is from a medical professional knowledgeable on the topic",
The most annoying thing about this app is that I am constantly clicking on stories in my Android notifications only to have it open up a completely different story that I don't care about.,
"THIS DID NOT KNOW WHAT CA USA LG IA IS BUT GOOGLE DID, AND THIS A MEDICAL APP",
Useful app with information.  One complaint: I turned off notifications in the app but I am still getting notifications.  Will have to remove that permission entirely it seems.,
"Very thorough, user friendly and informative. Videos and diagrams are great too. Nothing bad to say. I use or read from it almost every day. Info is always up to date.",
I really love this app except that it doesn't give room for deeper answers to symptoms. Great for the medications but I'd like more news about changes in medication laws. But it is a very helpful!!,
"A good reference with reliable information, before visiting your doctor.  Beware of the pseudo science websites.",
I love mebmd. I read this like other read FB. I'm anurse and I love learning new things,
"I find it hard to add all my meds to this app. Along with med. Adverse affects. I have so many illnesses, i wish this app. Could help with best options area for a paintent.  Finding a doctor who cares,and know ,and willing to help to find what's  best.",
"Has detailed information and articles, but is not as stable as I'd like.",
The app is an excellent tool for non-medical users to help determine your medical status. To arm you with information if or when going to the Doctor. Its also great for understanding your medications better. I love the wealth of information at my fingertips thanks to WebMD!!! Thank you!!!,
"I have been reading health info for 50 years. It was hard to know what was 
true! WebMD has the most accurate info based on the latest scientific 
research. They keep up on fact based info that was considered ""alternative"" 
in the past. They offer info on Home remedies that work as all info on 
medications! Thank you Web MD!",
I just like to get a chance to look at the news and see if I can a bit of help with my health issues +1 I am enjoying and learning. üòä,

"Great Sorce of Information,  Has All The Medicines I Take and How and When To Take Them.",
I have been using WebMD for years. I love checking up on my meds and a multitude of conditions to have a better understanding.,
I'd like to be able to type in my symptoms and the app then lists possible condition,
I love this app.. it is very very helpful especially with medications and being able to get the information you need.,
I think this app comes in handy when someone or myself come across a pill or a capsule and we are not sure what it is. This app helps trimendisley,
App has recently made good improvements in design.  The articles are very informative! I reference items and read often.,
Im suffering from an anal fissure and this app helped me find a Solutions to my problem.,

"I have used this app for a while. It is a great way to look up both meds, and an illness. It helps you understand what is going on with you. And ask better questions to the Doctor.",
"While not a substitute for a physician, WebMD is a great source for information.  I use it to prepare for a doctor's appointment and to clarify information.",
I like it the app  I haven't used it for tracking nor coaching.,

"This app has lots of good resources and info, and is ready to use; but the fact that there is no way way to opt out of targeted ads is why I give it only 3 stars. Don't register for an acct if you want to maintain some sort of privacy, although it still tracks the device you use. Thumbs down for consumer privacy protection.",
"I used to be in the medical field. I worked in an ER as a tech while I was completing my nursing clinicals/schooling. Unfortunately, after the birth of my only child I became very ill (not supposing to have had a child) and had to quit. Over the years since I have found WebMD to be a wonderful resource for both people that have medical experience and equally to those who don't. It's very user friendly and we'll organized while providing a large amount of excellent information. However, there is nothing that takes the place of an ER, 911, urgent care or a doctor's office if needed. Take your symptoms seriously and if you don't know how to read them then at that time WebMD is probably not your best resource. It is however, wonderful for most things of simple natures.",
I try to use WebMD for ant type of medical issue I want to know about. It is a great help in understanding something medical.,
All the app did was let me select body parts and a symptom. Doesn't check anything,
Runs very slow. My phone is brand new and even with high speed wifi its very slow....,
WebMD is useful for primary treatment and for basic knowledge. And make it for Indian based app. Then it is useful for local Indian people and market.,
1 short coming is that it doesn't have information on all questions i ask.,
One great feature is it has SD Card support; a lot of people like me just do not have enough memory on our phones.,
I absolutely love this app . So informative!!!!  There are millions of us that self diagnose before heading to the Dr.  . Thank you for helping us save money and save LIVES  SINCERELY greatful,
This is  a very useful tool when trying to figure out possible symptoms and know what to tell your doctor about what is bothering you. It can calm you down enough to keep you from having panic attacks,

This app is easy to use & very helpful.It give a accurate information!,
Great information provided...,
"The only thing I do not like about this app is that I have to click the back button to get to the homepage/menu which can be very time consuming and tedious. It would make the app alot more user-friendly if you guys had a home button or a menu button on every single page so when I look up symptoms and go down that thread, it won't take me a whole 2 minutes to get back to home screen/menu to start another task.  It may not sound like a long time at first but it makes a big difference. Thank you for your time.",
"I love the app, hate the politically motivated notices about sugar.  Is obvious WebMD has been taken over by another SJW",
WebMD is a great asset as a tool for health in knowing your health conditions and the medications that you're on it's very easy to follow and I am very very happy with the app itself it's a great way to keep track of what's going on in your help and then answers any question and it gives you references as to why they've given that answer it's an absolutely wonderful app you should get it that's my opinion,
"It provides a lot of good scientific information about the body and disease.  My only problem is with the diagnose symptoms. It gave a broad range of conditions each time, Some scary, others benign.  I tried to find a medicine that was an anti-inflammatory and the drug section is arranged by drug name, not what symptoms it addresses.",
WebMD is a social network of the top doctors in their field I don't think I need to say anything more and they all share their findings and they make it public to us so basically we're getting free education that they paid x amount of dollars for 8 to 12 to 15 years for yes everything on there is I have found so far to be 100% accurate and factual.,
"I like being able to check health information quickly.   I was a medical social worker so if something doesn't sound right, I check it out.",
Keeps telling me to call 911 and that I should seek medical attention it is probably right but my insurance doesn't start till January.  It has also helped diagnose simple things saving a trip to ER with kids.,
Best quick diagnosis app for possible conditions. Gastroenteritis shows up a bit too much though.,
"I have used this many times & never failed to get good info. In broad searches WebMD is always in sync with the respected, major sources",
It was very informative and great for when you're bored. But difficult to get a diagnosis on the symptom checker,
"Very informative. Have a lot of resources that covers a wide range of topics, presented in a simple and clutter free interface.",
"Perhaps I have not had access to all that this app has to offer, please provide full access to this app!!!",
I've always been a long time fan of Web  MD.,
"Before I downloaded it, the screenshots showed ""Communities"" which is exactly why I wanted a WebMD App. The app seems decent, but I'm disappointed I can't access the message boards.",
"Tried using symptom checker, all you get is a spinning circle.",
"The app is quite useful for looking up information and learning. However, despite turning off notifications, I still get a notifications for news stories (useful news, but I don't want or need the notifications).",
"I like it so far. It's handy when you need it, and I also like reading occasional articles they offer.",
"Would be better if it didn't ignore notification setting.  For me, none means none, not give them to me anyway.",
Great reference tool. The symptom checker I find is confusing.,
"Easy to navigate, found all my exotic diseases and the normal ones too!  Up to date and clearly written for immediate understanding!",
Supposed to be able to sync with Walgreens balance rewards. Unable to do so with app.,
This app has informed me a lot of times and I am so glad it is there for me.,
"Helpful, useful information to make daily changes for improved health for today and my golden years.",

You don't have to be a brain surgeon to get good Info that is easy to understand.,

I think the app gives a good picture of your problems. One must give good information for the best results.,

This was a great app before the recent update of all sorts of news related to the med field pops up. I am not in the country advertised and nor am I interested as a hobby in the medical field. There's not even an option to opt out of the notifocations. It demonstrates poor communication and knowledge of the variety of its demographic users.,
"It was great until I started getting all these pop-ups. I'm not interested in anything but symptoms, medications, and solutions. If I can't get the app to stop giving me news and other useless info, I'll have to uninstall it. BAD NEWS.",
It is an excellent easy to use resource with reliable info.  I have used it since it first came out and i have never felt that it didn't give me good infom,
"App pops up intrusive notifications about WebMD content. I did not request these notifications nor do I want them, but I can't turn them off in the app. That's tantamount to spamming in my book. Uninstalling.",
Very informative site. I use it when there are issues I need to be addressed with my physician that I feel are being ignored. Knowledge is power & thank you.,
"Very helpful and useful app. The Symptom Checker, mediation information and disease information are the areas we visit most.",
I spend hours on here. Helps with my human biology and chemistry obsession. üëç Love it.,
It helps from driving yourself crazy on what could be obvious & easy to solve at home.,
"WebMD is not only a waste of time, but it's also a disorder in and of itself - one that preys on the fear and vulnerability of its users to sell them half-truths and drugs.",
I love this site.  Look up symptoms.  Check meds and treatments.,
"Great info app,but took many pop-ups",
"I like it, I have something thats undiagnosed at this time and is helpful most of the time. Occssionally it seems to go off into left field and really go off the track, but probably 90% - 95% accurate?",
Works great on Note 8.. Love the self diagnosis feature. It's very helpful,
Great app.  It's a good resource before and after a doctor's visit,
I do like being able to search for things on health matters,
Web MD is very informative and reliable with a wide variety of issues.,
I have used this app many times and it is very easily to use and informative thanks,
My go to for anything medical üòö,
Easy to look up thinking and see what is want. Very helpful.,
Practical and easy to search medical issues.,
Great app saves time and money great information,
Very helpful app. Use it very time and very useful,
"Lots of helpful info, very convenient",
It's very helpful for getting new updates,
App is very informative and information is readily available.,
good for quick reference and possible action,
This app is great for possible info for what's going on,
Gives me all the information I need.,
It's A Great App,
Out of no where this app starts sending me B's notifications and I plan on deleting it now because of it.,
However the app is...it's good. I hope it will be better in future...,
Web md is not my only research I listen to my body.,
"Thank-You, very helpful.",
Excellent program!!!,
It just what i was looking for.,
Love it for quick info and guidance,
Thank you much info,
Nice app,
Love it sofar,

Good app,
Very helpful,
Work accurately,
Since the change you have to now login and they collect your information. The app used to be confidential but now you even get ads sent to your phone. You can't shut them off unless you are logged in. I am now removing this app.,
I'm always changing apps mainly out of boredom. Not this app I love it my Dr was very pleased I used it,
have webmd on my computer with all my medical history saved to. I really wish I could connect this app to that one. Do not want to put all my stuff in this app. They should work together,
"I think the asp it's ok, but when you are trying to look up pills to know what they are. Most of them don't exist in this app please fix",
I cannot find a way to turn off notifications. Deleting thus app.,
too many invasive permission and too many advert. Pls explain. Why do you need to install malware into our phone?,
One of the few apps I have that I really use without issues. Very informative and intuitive.,
Love it! This app helps me determine if a trip to the ER is necessary or if I should make an appointment with the Dr.,
Really....I enter something to check...and i get more topics about dogs and cats..as well as totally unrelated topics. Useless.,
I use this app frequently and find it very useful.,
"Started giving notifications. Don't see how to stop them, thus it's being uninstalled.",
Great medical information at your fingertips.,
Thank you given me updates,
"Ok, it's somewhat good",
very helpful and informative.,
Useful for me,
Cool thanks,
Best information,
Amazing,
"Just got this. Trying to enter all of my medications. Only half my drugs are there, had to use Google to see if their options were the as what I'm actually taking. I take 24 different meds. So I knew it would take a while to enter all of them but I didn't expect to at this for over 2 hours and I only have entered 8 pills and know so far they don't have my dosage or pill for 5. I'm giving up now. Might try again later...",
"The app placed an ad over a symptom in the symptom checker and I couldn't read what the symptom was. Really poor job with the ad placement. If you don't block symptoms in the symptom checker with ads, I'd probably give it a better rating, but that's just stupid having the ads there.",
"Great way to enter symptoms, but the top possibilities are always extreme when its usually just something simple. Its like Googling your cough and finding out you have cancer...",
"This is so informative and something I could refer back to, especially for those who don't work in the medical field.",
Shouldn't have to give any information on yourself in order to look something up about something,
Always crashing can't even load my meds and save them,
App won't let me select male or female. Other than that it seems to be a great tool.,
you can find any thing your looking for n is easy to search for,
Android notifications do nothing when you click on them,
Sympthom checker did not work - samsung s7,
I use this app for all my health inquiries.,
"Awesome  app i love this app, keep up the good work.",
Good for looking up problems.,
"Helpful, but lost my saved information with update",
Helpful info to talk to your MD about.,
Too specific on terms when used by common people.,
Love this app!,

Symptom checker very useful,

It has helped me with my anxiety, when I didn't even know it was anxiety, it has helped me to know more about my health, & the fact that it has a personal touch, it definitely deserves 5 stars. It has never once let me down. üòä",
"What doctors couldn't give me a name for, Web MD did. Thank you",

For the love of god please hire some decent UI/UX Designers. Don't skip out cuz that's the most important part.,
"Very informative app! You can easily find out just about everything you need to know about diseases, symptoms, and descriptions of medications if needed.",
It is a quick way to get some information for meds and symptoms/ illnesses.,

"Forget the other problems. The new version of this app just dropped a 
notification bar advertisement for a sleep scam on my phone. MALWARE! They

necessary?!?! These people are SKUM!",

This is an easy app for anyone who have multiple medications and physicians.  I  can pull up my medication checklist and transpose from each Dr. when I need to.,
Seems to be more difficult than it needs to be. For as much information as is in this app it is terribly hard to extract it. I wish it was easier to use.,
"I love it, always tells me i have cancer tho...  its a good referance if you have some background in medical and known that your not always dieing from the symptoms you out in. Not good for the anxiety ridden or hypochondriac.",

"This has great potential. I liked the goal options. However, when I want to track my sleep, there's nowhere in the app to track it. It would also be helpful to be able to copy and paste in the journal. Love the list for all meds, but need a way to track when they were taken so stay within limits for 24 hour periods. For now, I'll stick with other apps to track my fibromyalgia and chronic migraine.",

All the sudden it wants more permissions? ...../uninstalling,
I love this app,
A must for everyone,
"I downloaded this to check my wife's symptoms.  I had to enter her age and sex and an image of a female came up. You tap on the part of the body you want to check and you select the symptoms that apply. So far so good.  The problem is that if I want to check my own symptom or the symptom of my son, I have no way of switching the gender and age. I Uninstaller the app.",
I had to uninstall today when I realized that for the past week or two the app has created a webmd folder in my picture gallery and randomly puts pictures in it. Random pictures. I haven't even opened the app in months. I deleted them and they just came back on their own. 100s of random pictures of things like skin issues and illustrations of procedures.,
Overall not bad however probably not the most accurate. I had a sinus infection and it told me I had miningitus....caused quite a scare in the family,
This app is laggy on my Droid Z Play. I will play with it a bit to see if it gets better. If it does not get better I will uninstall it.,
"Confusing.. When i try to add more symptoms it starts over, why did you have to make an app.. It was so much easier on the site",

"I have always liked this app and Web site.  It is simular to the Mayo clinic book and Web site ( I believe The Mayo Clinic had a Web site? )  I have found it too be pretty dang accurate.   Based on a couple conditions that I personally have, and the info that has been provided is almost word for word what I have been told from doctors and surgeons.  Great job guys!",
"I found this online doing some research, and I'm glad I did. It's really informative, and accurate. Everything it says has found out to be true, as my doctor has agreed. Thank You. Would rate 100 stars if I could.",
"Very useful in helping ease your mind, as well as alerting you to the potential need to make an appointment with a doctor. I use it just about any time that I have a physical change or ailment.",
"good program, but they want to much access to your phone. when I wrote to them about it got bulls**t excuss uninstalled",
Good up to date information for everyone. Can take this to your doctor to verify ones health problem. Good recipes that are made more healthy than the original one.,
Anytime I need to look up a symptom the Web MD gives me what else and where to look. What I can buy or if I need a Dr. One of the best DL ever. Thanks.,
"I love the app because it is very helpful and it has been right on the money, it is in no means to be replaced by a doctor but it does let you know what is wrong with you.",
I can do my homework on meds then go to the Doctor and tell them why I don't like the meds I'm taking,
"OK information, not impressed w/simplistic common sense medical advice",
"What happened to being able to clock a body part and having options to 
click afterwards? I put in my symptoms now and it tells me it can't help 
with my results? Two stars only because it seems to work for others. I 
uninstalled.",
Have used this app for many years but now find that I can no longer log in to my account and access my saved items. Please remedy as many items have been saved over the years. Login screen remains blank.,
"There is no reason why an app that informs about health would need access to phone information like contacts, location, media files, and camera. The function and accessibility is nice.",
"Gives accurate information on symptoms, diagnosis, pill guide. All around good app!",
Being a to narrow down or give one an idea as to what may be going on. So where does it hurt LOL,
Very good for knowing side affects from meds and info to watch for that may be signs something wrong. Like articles on foods that are good for certain health issues you have! Looking up meds most important for me.  Interactions etc.,
"This is much better than my real doctor . And no waiting for 5 to 6 , even with an appt",
I absolutely love Web MD. I've used this site for at least 7-8 years. For personal use but mainly for educational uses since I am looking to enter into the medical field in college soon. I'm tremendously happy they have an app for it üíúüíúüíúüíúüíú,
I like the app but wish it factored for medications and other effects like smoking.,
"I use the site frequently to better understand health concerns of myself , family, & friends.",
Helped me a lot of times by now so I stared having more confidence in it than I would in the past in a similar program.,
"I am 29 and was diagnosed with Uterine Cancer. I wanted to see if this app was accurate in possible diagnosis... Nope... I put in all of my symptoms and it comes up with ectopic pregnancy, pcos, and pid... None of which I have... Fix the app please so it gives a more accurate possible diagnosis...",
Always helps me read up on meds I am taking also very helpful from keeping Dr. Not watching what they put you on!‚úå,
Why do you need access to my phone call history with new up,
Easy to find symptoms and general information of all kinds of health issues,
Greatest app ever It's is very useful to check on and understand the prescriptions that doctors give my family member's.,
Pointless for folks in the UK and other English-speaking areas of the world.,
App works well... My favorite is the symptoms checker,
Good useful advice much better than hearsay with .no facts to bsck them up.,
"Gives great help, for laymen & others, in understand'n ailments causes, cures, natural & medicinal helps, possible operations, what to look for as far as infections, bites, allergic reations - just simply lobe to havvit on hand!",

This app is really cool a it has helped me in times of emergencies,
I love it but its also the quickest way to make you feel like your dying,
I love reading the Webmd magazines at the doctor's office. I was so happy to run across this app!,
"Awesome App, helps alot  It's very informative as well",
Very helpful and informative especially when you can't remember everything the Doc said.,
Excited to learn all about it !,
Why so many permissions required? I'm not comfortable giving a medical app access to my device ID and all my contacts.,
It's a great app and useful of our  health concerns.,
Always answers my question whether identifying conditions or knowledge of medicine,
I always find helpful information especially drug side effects and interactions I use it often to share findings with family and friends but always refer them to a medical professional.,
Why does it need so many permissions to provide small bits of info? I like the information but the amount of permissions you keep adding over time without a real reason are off putting. Uninstalling.,
I find it easiest way to solve all kinds of health related questions.,
An asset for all of us; especially those in their 70s.,
Great diagnosis possibilities. Let's you know what you might be dealing with.,
It is very helpful when I need a medication answer.  Love Webb MD.,

This is amazing this site led me to my dream career.,
"Very good app, I'm pleased with how easy it is to navigate the app. I have actually recommend it to friends and family! Good app.",
All diagnosis if serious should still be checked by a doctor the app is more of a guideline and also gives peace of mind I find it most helpful,

It just spun when searching for anything.,
I think this is a great medical app an has accurate information,

Okay..,
Trying to find an app where I can find information about several things in one place,
Constantly refer to it,
"It allows me to track the names of my meds but not much else. Would be better if I could track dosages and frequency. ALSO, I would like a place to track immunizations. Today I went to my doctor and was asked, when was my last tetanus shot. I don't know. They are good for 10 years and it is hard to remember that time frame when you are 60. I know I've had one but was it within the last 10 years or was it 15 years ago......",
"It's great to have the medical issues or questions at your fingertips. I also love the drug section where you can look up the medication and find out any and everything about medicines. I make sure I have this app on every electronic devices i.e phones, tablets, computers etc. You can't go wrong with this app",
"App was unable to give possible causes for something as simple as ""diarrhea,"" stating that no possible causes could be found, yet something as obscure as ""fear of air"" as a symptom had an immediate result. I found this app to be completely useless. The actual WebMD website had 44 possible causes for diarrhea, btw. I'm not going to waste my time with this app again. Uninstalling.",
"Gives me everything I need to look things up and check on certain symptoms and medications. Could be a little more user friendly. Been having an issue with the a-z list, it always scrolls to the top and the side slide bar does not work well for fast scrolling.",
"I like this app very much. It is very helpful especially when you need to know if it medication conflict with another medication. Furthermore, it is a good source for information concerning medical matters before you need to contact a nurse or pharmacist: ALWAYS CONSULT A PROFESSIONAL IF IN DOUBT OR IN AN EMERGENCY.",
"WebMD helps in my family's daily fight against Crohns. I can depend on WebMD to have the information I need on this disease. WebMD also has easy to understand descriptions of medications, their uses and side effects. The app is easy to use, up to date and accurate. It is a tool I use often to research Crohns and it's treatment.",
"Until I learned that everything I type,  every medical condition or question, when researching medication,  YOU ACTUALLY SHARE WHATEVER INFORMATION THAT INFO WITH OTHER SOURCES.  That would explain the calls/emails I get regarding my diabetes,  I DON'T HAVE DIABETES.   I looked it up in support of my grandmother.   That's just to name one.  This app was even discussed on Good Morning America.   I can't believe you can sell/share what searches I've done.",
"I'm in the medical profession and I really enjoy the features this app has available. I enjoy putting in symptoms to see what it comes up with sometimes, just to play a bit. I have found it useful in showing at-home treatments until a doctor's appointment can be made or a visit to urgent care/ED. **Do not rely on this app as a substitution for real-life medical advice.**",
"I updated my apps, webmd included and now it won't work. I get to the body to pick where my pain is and when I select any part, it tells me it can't connect to the internet. I do have signal and everything else works. I even uninstalled and reinstalled. Still don't work. I do use this app a lot so please help me fix and I will give 5 stars.",
"I have been using WebMD for years. I like how easy they make it to look things up. For example: If you find a pill on the floor, and you don't know if it is yours or your roommate's, all you have to do is run a search on WebMD, and it will tell you what the name of the pill is. Now you know if it is yours or not. There is a lot more to WebMD then what I wrote, check it out for yourself. I am sure you will find what you are looking for. Happy Searching...",
"It helps me to not want go to the hospital for every little thing. When I am concerned about a particular ailment or medication, I'll plug it in the WebMD App and it'll either help calm my nerves or have concerns that I can address to the doctor or nurse when I see them. Sometimes when I enter a particular medication or ailment, it'll have several things that come up or none at all. The none at all is a bit troubling but then I'll have to ask a person or take it to the Internet, not social media.",
"It used to be a good app however, the last few updates have failed to resolve gaps in data. For example, you look up a med and it doesn't show the data. This occurs even with common meds. I now use Medscape which is far more powerful and informative.",
"If you need medical input and answers, this is the app for you! THE go-to source for medical questions, symptoms check ups, advice, drug interactions, and so much else too numerous to mention. Not to be substituted for serious issues, but for a quick and easy determination for anything medical, this is the best thing short of having a doctor on call.",
This app is easy to use and very informative. It really can help when trying to decide if something you are experiencing is worthy of a doctor's visit...or quick tips on how to treat certain injuries at home. Also has great information on medications too! Provides a little more peace of mind in my busy life.,
Missing a ton of symptoms (such as sore throat.....) UI is garbage and can easily cause users to go back to the main menu (a lose the symptoms they have already entered.) WEBMD does not allow the use of their site for mobile without the app. And the app sucks so thanks webmd.,
"I downloaded this when my pharmacy required it for tracking. I went to sign up,  but it told me several times that my email was invalid! I wrote to developers,  using the ""invalid email""which isn't & they wrote back telling me to enter my email.  I wrote again, Then I was told to go to their web site & sign up there,  then come back to the app,  & do... and it would be passed on to their technical team.  I have waited, they haven't responded, so I am uninstalling, and that is the truth.",
"Its very helpful to get an idea od what coyld possibly be a diagnosis to your symptoms.  It does not give you so much information that you neglect to consult a physician, which is very important. It also has given me the side effects to medications when I forget after tossing the print out from the pharmacy##",
I have used Webmd online for years and was delighted to be able to have it away from home. As a senior citizen I am always investigating 'new' drugs and procedures because my husband and I never know what our aging bodies will do next. I want to be able also to talk to my grandkids about what they might be prescribed.,
I can now see why people using web md are hyperconderacts.  Messing asteroid work it today thinking i have a chest cold. Some pain while breathing.  Going though the symptoms ever other answer cause the app to throw up a warning to call 911.  No i am not having a heart attack.,
"Extremely helpful with everything from symptoms to treatment to every condition I could think of and hundreds if not more that I never heard of. Need to find out about drugs ( prescription or illegal) you will find it. Need to know what a pill is you can find out by color, shape or numbers on the pill.extremely good apt for finding out conditions before spending time and money on doctors visits. I recommend this apt for all people! I'm so glad I have it downloaded on my phone. FIVE STARS DEFINITELY!",
"In general it had a few basic symptoms missing that I thought would be on there like chest congestion, or dehydration. Just overall disappointed in this app so far cause I'm wanting to see that my symptoms could have ment before I drove all the way to the hospital.",
"Hello,  Good afternoon, I've  always  searched for WebMD and never saved it as an app.  But the day I made the conscious decision to you keep the app.  Because, it's  the first  site when  I need  medical care.   The site is  has such awesome information, and you can just  ask everything medical that you need and you will get a reply spontaneously.   This  is my first review or statement I have a question not related to WebMD.  But the reference to open enrollment for medical plans,   I just left a meeting and I'm as confused coming out of the meeting as I was going in;  can I have an opinion from someone.",
"I like the convenience and ease of use.  However, they removed the edit profile button on the latest version (though help indicates it should still be there), and as a parent, I need to be able to adjust that to meet my needs when trying to figure out what is going on with the kids.  I would also recommend they add a way to report problems with the app to the developers so we could tell them about problems without hoping they read their reviews.",
"WebMD Web site. Succinct  and on point.  A resource  more useful for many  who  can benefit from it. Puts many complex issues in language  requiring no Latin ---much overused and which is not needed.  Effective communication is the goal among patients, people looking for a reference  and the medical and allied fields. This site accomplishes that objective.",
While going and talking to your physician is always best. This app helps you to think about your symptoms and if there ARE any serious symptoms it advises you to seek out your physician. Yes it tells you POSSIBLE diagnosis of your symptoms but you should not be playing doctor and take your concerns to them. Always check with your doctor and never self medicate or diagnosis. This is just a reference guide. I use it a lot as an informational guide.,
At first it was a really great app did exactly what I needed and then it started downloading a bunch of images that I didn't give permission to and it worries me bc of all the bugs and viruses going around for android so I'm deleting immediately. Now I know why it wanted access to my camera...totally unsettling.,
"Now I don't even need to listen to my doctor's professional opinion! I just walk in, tell them what the internet said, and demand a second opinion when he tells me I don't have brain cancer and it's only a head cold. A real life saver!",
"The health information provided by WebMD is great.  But my email is cluttered with daily hints that I cannot find a way to stop. I uninstalled the app. I ""unsubscribed"", but the spam keeps coming.  My suggestion: do not download the app.  Instead, Google a topic and look at WebMD as well as other sites to get your information.",
"Always see your Medical Provider. But for any medical questions you may have about your children, spouse, yourself, medications, etc...This is the most thorough & trusted site I've ever come across in years. (I also trust the Mayo Clinic. That should give you an idea how trusted and complete this site is.) It also has a Symptom Checker. So those of us that may jump to conclusions, and think the worst, go here first-and Call & make an appointment with your Doctor.",
"I think it's good for getting an idea of probable ailments but nothing beats going to a real physician. For instance, I had shingles and it told me I had the flu, lucky I have a medical student friend who forced me to see a doctor because it was on my cranial nerve & could have permanently damaged my eye",
I just got this app but I love it soo much already. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and constantly fear I have something seriously wrong or am ill. This app made me feel better because I put in symptoms and popped up anxiety as #1 result. Also has a lot of great information :),
We in today's world are quite busy and I couldn't visit or should I say didn't take the doctors visit that seriously. I then put in my symptoms here and I got a warning so I went to my doc and got myself check and learned that I was at high risk of a heart attack. This app isn't a doctor but a guide. Thanks guys...,
Whenever I feel sick or unwell I do a quick chekup on this app to know my health status and if I need to stop by the doctor for further help. It also gave me more insight on health. I just wish this app had some research on acne and remedies for it! But I don't have any other problems with this app! Its incredible!,
"Love web md, it's good to have when u need info on what may be wrong with you or your children just by choosing your symptoms and narrowing down the un professional diagnostics but regardless of being professional or not it's still helpful..always good to have",
"It was not bad yet it was not good either. Hence, my rating of three stars. My main concern was that I was sick and it WANTED ME TO PINPOINT IT ON MY BODY?! That part made ZERO sense. I just deleted the app after that. Like what? You want me, to locate a sickness on my body? Makes no sense. Thats like saying to locate where your unidentified disease is on your body. The concept is just no.",
"I would love to see a more seamless effort from data,  information in medical technology,  a possible connection with you tube since it has so much in the way of medical surgeries,  diseases,  etc. I'd like to see WebMD. Tap into multiple web sites as to gather more updated information and education",
"Most informative source of medical info i've ever been able to instantly access 24/7+365. You offer info on how to avoid illnesses, how to recognize different diseases, when you can treat it yourself, or when you need a MD, and when to call 911. And that's just scratching the surface.Thanks, Web MD is a real lifesaver.",
"It's a very helpful app. This app helps me alot to look up symptoms for anything I need to help me get better that's anything miner . Like Cold/flu, strap throat,headaches & more. It helps me to figure out what to do if it starts getting worse in the long run so it doesn't effects others & me. Which I wouldn't want. That's how much I care. I just want to get better if I ever had a  issue. I know to go see a doctor. I rate this app five stars. Thanks! for your help Web MD. I appreciate that.",
"It's an awesome app to have. It gives photos of the medication with the side effects , it narrow down your systems, and it give accurate results on information you pull up. When I visit my doctor I have more accurate information about my system thanks to this app. Its awesome",
"I often have a new diagnosis every few months because I have a lot of medical problems and when I have to wait weeks for the doctor to check me out, it gives me a little bit of peace to have some sort of idea of what I have. And I know docs hate WebMD but if you know how to use it right and you remember that they are possible conditions, and that you don't actually have them until you're diagnosed, then webMD can be very useful and helpful.",
"I was trying to look up ""red spots on skin"" , suspecting chicken pox, but the app was no help at all. There's no option to click on for skin symptoms. When I searched for red spots, ""skin"" came up in the drop down menu, but clicking on it did nothing. Useless app. Uninstalling it",
Web MD has helped me with finding accurate answers for different types of problems I am dealing with. Web MD has helped me to get the right questions to ask my doctor so that we could get the answers I need to handle my diabetes and my other health issues. Thank you for helping me with my health issues. Web MD is great program.,
"Using symptoms to help diagnose a problem can easily send your mind running in multiple directions. It""s very easy to become overwhelmed when your symptoms seem to match multiple medical conditions some of which can be real unnerving. Just remember to use this app as a too to assist you in making informed medical divisions along with your doctor...it's not to be used to replace your physician.",
"The flow of the app is really not clear. I've tried to put all my symptoms in one after the other, and I've had the app exit and delete my progress six times already. Either make the flow clearer, prompt users that their info will be cleared out, or save it if the user has the same medical issue again (best option so I don't have to f###ing enter over 20 symptoms from all over my body again if the issue recurs!)",
"Very informative. Certainly clarified, what ""true constipation."" Truly  is, and which isn't. I'm disabled due to Fibromyalgia, and degeneration of my lower spine. Also, I am a Type 2 Diabetic, Thyroid problems (I always get  confused on which 1 have (low thyroid, I am required to take  Synthroid), and I take codeine.  I have everything that can causes  constipation. Great source, for the information I so needed.",
"I do like this app & intend to keep it.   It's great that I can do searches of conditions, symptoms & medications as well as get first aid information. Adding a dictionary of medical terms and the list of medical tests & procedures were also excellent ideas.   However, the functions to find a hospital, physician or pharmacy as well as the Walgreens option to refill or transfer prescriptions are specific to the US.I can't help but wonder how much space I could save (and time/frustration from accidentally hitting  those options) had I not had those options on this app.  Removing them from the initial app but creating add-ons specific to various  countries  would have worked better.",
"I've used this app many times, for many years, and it's always been easy to navigate, super informational, and consistently reliable.  It's a piece of mind to someone like me, who suffers from an anxiety disorder as well.  I would definitely recommend it.",
"Since the new update with ""upgrades"" and fixes, you can't change the age, gender, or location of the person you're looking up symptoms for. Not very useful for families or people with significant others. Also, why do they need camera access? They don't have the pill identifier anymore, so camera access is just creepy.",
"Use it anytime I'm prescribed medication, especially if it's something I'm not familiar with. Good to find out about warnings, uses, drug interactions or possible side effects. First aid info, Medical Terminology.  WebMD has everything. A must have app.",
"I have been using WebMD for quite a while on my Nexus 7 as well as on Windows. I like the structured look of the app and the probabilistic ranking of possible causes it comes up with for a given symptom. I would suggest however that in advanced versions, the app allows for a chronological matrix of symptoms, rather than individual symptoms, to be supplied by the user. That should be a lot more realistic.",
"WebMD is the app I trust the most when I want to look up information in regards to conditions, treatments, as well as side affects and uses of prescription drugs. The app is very convenient and I like that it gives the user the opportunity to see reviews from other people that have taken the same medication. I also like how you can put in symptoms and it will give you possible problems.  It's a GREAT app that's easy to use, don't know what I did before WebMD was available!",
#NAME?,
"Should allow better precision with symptoms. Like you should be able to select your hand instead of whole arm, upper, middle, lower back instead of whole back, face instead of whole head, etc. Doesn't allow you to really say where your symptoms are exactly but does allow a general area. Pretty good information in the app overall.",
"I am supposed to have an upper left menu that will take me to Healthy Target, my data, then Walgreens balance rewards.  I signed up (had to search just to find...now am I logged in or not?   1 screen comes up...Health Tools. No upper left takes me there. Only Transfer Walgreens Prescription section. If I can learn to connect to my Balance Rewards and or find the login/out scren on the App. I see the login on a pc tho?  Im good with computer sites but apps seem to have different setups.  Newer to smartphones",
"Google maps. Other maps apps. Spotify. So many apps have offline database capability. You need offline ability in the options. Let me select to download the databases in the settings menu, so when I'm cut off in the middle of nowhere, on an adventure our because another hurricane Katrina comes through, I can get some perspective on situations that come up by still being able to use all the features offline. Maybe create a monthly build that we can update to.",
"For whatever reason, every time I open the app, a ghost app appears in my list with the letters 'SD' on it.  The only way to make it go away is to uninstall then reinstall.   Annoying.  Otherwise, useful information for the hypochondriac in me.",
"Excellent little tool for what it is. Simple research guide for quick, digestible answers. You're not going to perform surgery from this app, but you may set your (or someone else's) mind at ease with an answer after the Dr/Pharmacy closed.",
"A gold standard; very through and comprehensive.  No major/minor flaws that I have found. Wish they had 6 *so I could justifiably rate higher.... updated.   Sure would like a non ad version, current ads are annoying.",
Best med app I've seen.  But would be nice if there was an option to add more details. Like emotions or bm consistency.,
I've always found great information through Web MD and the app makes it very simple and quick to research things.,
"I like this app because it gives some really good, understanding, and useful information about medical conditions and guides to understanding your health.",
"This is the best. Great if it incorporates a direct human connectivity apparatus, so conditions which can not be known to laymen could be found as well. I.e probable conditions which makes blood sugar high and low in metabolism etc.",
"But really hard to get use to and some what glitchy. All in all, it's most common response is to consult a doctor and I would suggest the same. Other than that, great way to learn new things about our own body and how to keep ourselves healthy.",
I love it. Very useful but they should add the ability to check herbs and supplements for different conditions as can be done on the site.,
"This app is no where near what I expected. I downloaded it for Symptom checker but I have tried to click on an ear over and over but it just brings up problems with the face. I even zoomed in, still can't do it. Search does not work. Uninstalling.",
Symptom checker doesn't provide enough information or options for conditions. You have to add a symptom again to get to the menu where you find possible conditions. An awkward menu organization.,
"I have a torn ligimint, and bone spur I found this out after checking my symptoms on this app then seeing a doctor.",
"It's easy to check prescription details and to look at certain conditions; however, it does not replace medical advice.",
Very easy to use.  It has helped me out a lot with medications and their possible side effects with every day language.,
"One of the best app in medical genre, it has everything like disorders, terms nd explains everything,  as a student it's very useful for me , kudos to the team",
Useless. It ask you what disease do you have with a long list of choices instead ( how am i supposed to know. Im asking you.) It only gave me a choice of one symptom possibility.  What a waste of my time.,
When I go to sympom checker it asks for postcode but will only let me put in numbers. So cannot get past that. So unable to use it so piontless.,
The app just tries to represent website on app. Very poorly made. Does not get information most of the times,
"Every one get lot of knowledge about their health,very useful for every human being all over world.",
"When you think you know why your body feels like it does, but you just want a second opinion on what is causing your body to feel like this, the Symptom Checker can help 90% of the time. Always go to your doctor if it is serious.",
As much as I like the idea of having a medical text at your fingertips those with cyber hypochondria should avoid this app at all cost. Remember that you are not a doctor and if you have a tingling sensation in your foot it does not mean you're going to die.,
"Unbeknownst to me, this app decided to create its own album of medical photos in my phone's gallery. Unnecessary and gross (both definitions apply here) invasion of my storage space.",
"I use this app A LOT!!! When you search your symptoms, It shows multiple possibilities that are actually  real.. Unlike Googling It and freaking out about all the scary possibilities that usually aren't the problem. I really like how accurate the info from this app is. Overall, I love my web md app.",
"I can use the menu and all the features it offers such as symptom checker and conditions, etc. , but any time I click on a possible condition nothing loads, I have to open it in a browser to see it. Which kind of depletes the purpose of this app",
"I've used the syptom checker several times and the thi gs it comes up with make no sense. I also would try to look up a specific condition and each time with no success. For instance, trying to figure out if the white/green stuff coming out of my nose is a sign of a sinus infection or just a bad cold... tells me I have kidney failure?? I will be deleting the app.",
"I really liked the previous WEBMD app. I did not want this version, it changed on its own, without my permission. Sadly I can no longer find the previous one. Even the picture/avatar of the site is different. Oh, and what happened to the PILL IDENTIFIER? That was the best help, when you didnt know the name of that pill in the bottle that had become illegible?",
"Been using app for years, with new improvements I only expect more from already excellent service.",
"Helps me with anything I have questions on, need info, and will be an excellent and reliable source when I start my CNA program in the fall.",
"Yes, WebMD is the app...no, the information hub, that makes you deal with ease and intelligently to any problem - be it of any sort. It's my lifetime companion that sits gracefully on my phone's home screen!  Got a question though : can I save the Web pages in the pdf format to read offline when at emergency, with no access to network?",
This app is what every physician needs in handy. It has all possible conditions with proper treatment and management. I'd love if there'd be an offline version of this. It's not possible to access internet every time and everywhere. Still love it.,
"I can find most of the basic stuff I need to here,I have kids and even as a nurse I have to look back at stuff sometimes.",
"Bugs with back navigation. When you search & go to articles & hit the phone's back button it takes you to the home page instead of the previous page or search results and you need to start over.  Very frustrating! (Yes the back arrow works better)  Also the saved star indicator stays lit after you save one article, even if you go to others. Makes it harder to know which are saved or not. Also saving an article reached by search may save/un the search, not the article. Please fix these ASAP.",
"I like the way it tells me my medicine interactions and FDA warnings and Alerts me. Too many  medical conditions, too many medicines.",
"Look it crashed after I downloaded it. If you need 5stars, fix it so that i can use it.",
"really helped me two times, very accurate, although your real diagnose may not be first on the list it is surely somewhere in first diagnoses",
I use this app all the time to check out medical conditions and medicine it's  awesome.The information is up to date and accurate.,
"Compared to the medical information currently available on the market, this is one of the best, if not the best medical app I have found. It's updated regularly. And meets all your medical needs. If this apps doesn't deserve a five star rating, no app does.",
This app is good to turn to when you have a medical question. You get answers quickly and without waiting for a call back. But don't rely on this 100% still have to use some common sense.,
"It's Great! It's simple to use & gives me enough info that I need about Meds, Symp, short explanation to include the possibilities ""Why"" my physician has chosen it, & Side effects etc....if I feel I need further Info, at that point I would obviously turn to my pharmacist Physician for further info etc....I don't understand Why people are giving this app so much negativity, simply because you can't expect Any app to answer Everything! I highly recommend this app as I have done with Family & Friends",
this app is very helpful BUT the terms used in explaining things are too difficult. we are not doctor's pls break them down a little.,
"Gives a variety of options instead of the regular ""I looked up a headache online and apparently have brain cancer.""",
"Still a good app. Liked the original Web MD, though.  Still very informative and can save an unnecessary trip to the doctor, and a lot of unnecessary worry.",
"Keeps crashing since last update. Was my favorite, but now I can't keep it up",
Awesome source for all kinds of health and medical information. Also up to date with new medication that comes out. I trust the info on this site to be solid.,
When something isn‚Äôt going quite right and you want to investigate the possibilities this app proves very helpful.  Also can help you prepare for a doctor‚Äôs visit.,
"Sometimes I use the symptoms checker beforehand, to check when something is wrong and it has helped me alot AND it's right about what's going on with me at the time.",
It's been fairly spot on most the time but it would be nice if their was a more detailed diagnosis section for like if one is in pain at rest and not while active.,
The apt is not easily search typed in symptoms. It pulls up annoying drop boxes that do not match symptoms very well. Uninstalled,
It's a great app. to have at hand because it keeps you knowledgeable when there is somethings you or wanting to know about concerning yourself.,
Don't like to have to rate to get rid for good of corresponding popping up invitation and therefore give only mediocre rating.,
I use this as my 'go to' app to find out quick info on medical conditions and/or symptoms & treatments.  Very helpful.,
"I Love This App, I always find all the information needed for any and all of my health concerns. It also keeps me up to date with research about new discoveries as well as the Slideshows that basically has answers to any questions of how the body functions! Ty",
"Like having your own DR/NURSE/PHARMIST to ask questions and get a possible answer, so you can decide to make your choice to take off work to see your doc.",
It's not a replacement for a doctor and it's not a definitive diagnostic tool but it could be a very useful tool to understand illnesses etc...,
"I am very glad to have this app. Indeed it provides direction to one who wants to know the cause and immediate treatment of the pain, discomfort and concern. Thank you so much.",
"I've been using WebMD for years for all things from symptom checking to learning about different medications symptoms. I credit WebMD symptom checker to saving my life. It helped me discover I needed to go to the ER, where I ended up needing to have an emergency surgery.",
"I like all the other info in the app, but if I try to use the symptom checker, the app stops working.",
"Looked for tips for a thrown out back, according to the symptom checker I have a broken shoulder blade or a blood clot.",
"Says I have an invalid email address.  Yet, it's the same address I use on the website edition.",
Love the info but sometimes I need to limit myself....too much information is not always a good thing.,
"Definitely check this app out before going to the doc. Ignore the ""you have cancer"" results. Haha! Also a pill identifier section would be a great addition.",
"General medical information. Good app for advice on what conditions you may have, what to tell your doctor, when to notify doctors and usual prescribed medications. Always recommending consultation with medical authorities. Good for general information. I'm very comfortable with consulting WebMD!",
"I rate this app a three because I frequently cannot find conditions I need to research. However, when I do locate a condition or pharmaceutical name, the information is usually thorough.",
The app used to function properly. It has lost all of its main functionality. I went to the pill identifier it won't identify any pills it won't even identify as Tylenol or ibuprofen anything it won't do anything so oh well I guess it's time for a new app,
App provides good info if you can select the right body part on the symptom checker.  Difficult to do on my Android.,
"I find this app hilarious. As a 18 year only female diabetic, no matter what combo of symptoms I put in the top answer is always perimenopause, every.single.time.",
"I have used this app since it first came to the web. I heartedly recommended it to parents of young kids or babies, older parents or siblings with chronic care needs or even young, active people in need of first aid advice while travelling or camping. Even my grown children with their young families use it before calling the pediatrician in th middle of the night.",
This newer version sucks. The last one you could list multiple symptoms and find a condition based on those symptoms.  This one doesn't do that.,
"First aid info, drug info, medical glossary! Awesome! Only thing I noticed: some of the generic names of medications show photos for the brand name version, ie. sertraline show images for Zoloft. Yes, Zoloft is sertraline, but the pills look totally different. This could be problematic and potentially dangerous. Not that I recommend getting drug ID advice from an app, but you know how people are.... Otherwise, the update is awesome.",
"The app really gives vital information to people who have been diagnosed with the disease, and to people who have not yet received an affirmative diagnosis.",
This Web MD app saved my life from a deadly. sickness I had.  Thank you to the team who created this app you saved my life.,
"Easy to use app.I got useful information about my problem. On the basis of which I could select the right doctor for consultation. However, to locate a suitable doctor I tried another app.",
It lags sometimes and it seems like it's missing some features after updates but it serves its purpose.,
My go to for every illness adult or child. I use this app at least 5 to 6 times a month,
"My parents each take several different medications and I am able to look up each one to know what they are for, what side effects to expect and I love knowing what combinations might react with each other or even the foods they eat. Great app!",
"Once I go through the trouble of entering in all symptoms, it just ""thinks"" forever and never shows possible conditions.",
"I hate a fever of 102.7. Nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain on upper right, back aches and chills. And my head aches, plus I'm lightheaded when standing. WebMD insists I have muscle strain in my back.  Hello!?! How about flu or gall bladder? The aches go with the fever. My back is fine. Poor quality app.",
"It does help narrow things down, but it seems like if it asked a few more questions, it could narrow things down a lot further.",
This app. Is a must have. Helps in dianogstics to determine if a visit to the emergency room is needed. Also the imformative buletins are extremely educational.,
"I have anxiety so I always play around with the symptom checker. This is a great app for people who are constantly worrying about having ""something wrong."" It is also good for those more serious issues where you're just not sure if you should go yo the drs or not. I am very happy I downloaded this app! 5 stars!",
"5 Star Rating.   Easy to install, quite Useful and Informative.   Highly recommend to everyone over 18 yrs old.",
"Dont get me wrong, this app seems to be wonderful for various types of seemingly everything. Except... i give it three stars because a suggestion to the developers is to do an update on the information. I downloaded the app looking specifically for information on low blood sugar and there was absolutely nothing what so ever, so im a little disappointed with that, but thats okay. Hopefully it will be released in an update. But its not enough to make me give a necessarily bad review. Jesus loves you!",
"Very informative, and can give concise  information. Many times, I calmed my nerves reading the information I was seeking. All is well,now ,and recovering. Thank you..",
"Great information, but after looking up something on the app, I would end up with sometimes 100 documents on  my phone. ..a chart on how to perform CPR, info on child acute asthma, etc. Today, I found some of those files made it to my Google Drive! How and why does the app do this?",
I have rheumatoid arthritis and I'm always getting some type of symptom. I just go to the app and usually learn it's normal for my condition.  Thank you for easing my worries.,
"Excellent App. However, the search option could be expanded as bit so that you can use more words to search wider, especially with regards to medical conditions where you need to explain and or describe the condition, where one does not know the medical term and or name.",
I just found a photo gallery on my phone of pictures from Web Md. Things I never looked up.  And things I sure as Hades didn't screen shot or download.  I'm deleting this app. This was just too gross.,
This app help me diagnose myself to find out I had pneumonia and I went to emergency thank God for this app.,
This is one of the best apps in my  mobile. It works like you have a team of doctors combined of M.S. M.D. D.M. physician with you.,
"After discovering this app never have to wait on hold for the pharmacy again, scan and go then I get the call when it's ready.",
Common symptoms not listed. Can't figure out the body symptom checker :(,
"This is the best app.never any problems, plus it is so very helpful. Thanks for making it",
This website is great information for the novice. It arms patients with useful information that will help them better engage with their physician.,
"In fact, this app provide so useful many information and easy to  find it. Thanks so much developer. I recommend everyone to use it when u want to know about your health condition. 5 star  :)",
"As a result of a motor vehicle accident, I suffer many conditions. Without WebMD, I couldn't know what treatments are possibly in contradiction of others. And too many more reasons for words ...",
"My must have and go to guide daily for myself, family, and friends. I'm a chronic pain patient and on pain management,  so this is perfect for me to reference.",
"While I like their website, their app has problems.  For example, search does not work at all.  All in all, you are probably better served by their website.",
"Can help you get an idea of not maybe what you have,  but some ways to treat your symptoms.",
"Error message ""Can't install on USB or SD storage."" I have a blank, formatted, mounted 16GB SD card installed and accessible, and plenty of on phone storage space available.",
So far it has answered to my satisfaction every medical question I have had. I do not expect a diagnosis but it has helped me talk to my doctor. I dig it.,
"This app is very helpful in most cases. I use it all the time to see what possible symptoms I or my family may be having, and it is usually spot on.",
"This app help take panic out of not knowing  what's  really going on, it's  talking to your doctor  24/7 about all kinda  conditions,  thanks Web MD.",
This app is fairly helpful in giving one a general idea of what may be going on health wise. I usually use symptom checker with the list. Sometimes though I do get some pretty strange answers lol.,
"I wish I could opt out of sharing my location with this app!!! Some apps sell location and personal data to advertising companies etc. Some apps, like brightest flashlight free, masquerade as a useful thing, but their PRIMARY purpose is selling geodemographic data! Therefore all apps with respect for users should allow us to OPT OUT of sharing personal and location information!!! Stand up for your rights before its too late!",
I'm a new Nurse Practitioner and enjoy the resource that can give you immediate access to a wealth of health information.,
"It's a very helpful app, and easy to use. I like to use it for minor things that I can take care of at home and saving me a trip to ER or doctors office.",
It was extremely difficult to get into the WebMD site. It kept saying invalid email address or password or the combination of them were not valid.,
When I taking classes in the past and looking going forward to better my education. And I also use this on a daily basis each and every day.,
I like it but a pill identifier would be great. Its a pretty cool app. Especially for people like me that are interested in medical stuff.,
Better than any MD's diagnosis although no guarantees or warranties should be implied.,
"When coworkers tell me their ails, I usually don't know what it is. I quickly look it up and am able to converse with them on a semi intelligent level.",
"Helped and nice info but details needed more, so can fully trust in emergency.",
Love this app. Works great on my phone. Great to be able to look up meds and illnesses.,
It has helped me with minor questions so I'm not in hold forever with my Dr's office and it has helped me understand some of my medications better.,
The application is incredibly smart. Every medical situation is readily available at your finger tips. Download on your mobile phone for your first aid  diagnosis.,
Type in your symptoms and get a range of possibilities. Just don't run to your doctor saying the app tells you that you have a broken bone.,
"This is a great app for just randomly reading up on first aid and what not. As a future medical student, this is a great app to help me study. Although some medications are missing info.",
"I Enjoy Reading The WEBMD THEREFORE, IT HELPS REFRESHING ON MY MEDICAL FIELD FOR MASSAGE THERAPY",
"Very  informative and helpful especially if you want to save yourself a trip to the E.R , and it's a big plus because it's easy to use.",
Must have for all. Saves the trip to doctors / prompts for quick action to visit and on misdiagnosis,
Never diagnose yourself. Just use it to help you find the right questions to ask the doctor.,
This an excellent app.  Not intented to make you a doctor but  it does give you a lot of great info on medical conditions,
Really excellent I never see any app like this its really very beneficial app I like it very much. Keep it up,
"I can add the doctors myself, thank you. Nobody gets access to my contacts unless they absolutely need it. Uninstall",
"Extremely helpful when learning more about my conditions.When Docs talk in strange lingo and hard to understand, I go to this app and things become more clear.In plain english. Lessons many stresses that are unnecessary. I recommend this app to many.",
Use this app quite often. I am a nurse and it's always good to look up s/s and their treatment options,
I read great information about different diseases and conditions from this app. Definitely recommend it.,
"It provides real medical information to help you assess when to see a doctor, when to go to the hospital, and when to suck it up at home. Gives great home remedies and explanations for procedures.",
"For the most part, it's a great app. Sometimes when I know what's wrong, the symptom checker guess way off the grid or what I need help on isn't available. Over all, a good app.",
I like this Web site it has a lot of good information on different types of illnesses and health problems along with treatments. But coming from a nursing standpoint it's not always completely right or understandable.,
"We have Changed our Treatment Guidelines From Froyos¬†To Ice Cream Sandwiches. More Studies Are Needed Before Recommending Lollipops.             Evidently the ""MD"" doesn't stand for Material Design.",
"This app is great to help you in the right direction, it is not an official diagnosis tools and everyone is different, so take it for what its meant to be, a tool.",
It truely helps. I'm a caregiver and when seeing a reaction or new med given to the patient by the doc. One can never be to sure the side effects and this app is so helpful.,
Really has a good layout and you can look up stuff you need to know or figure it out.,
"Overall I'd say its a pretty cool app, it gives you general information about what you might be searching,  and it's easy to navigate",
I've always used this because I have health issues and they have been very helpful. Yes I would recommend this site to others. Thanks Web MD.,
If I didn't use this app I might have just kept assuming I had a stomach bug and not gotten treated for my appendicitis in time.,
Doesn't let u describe multiple symptoms together... U pick on spot on the body and that is all it will diagnose.,
"I'm a first responder and I have used this providing patient care as well my own personal use, it's a great app.",
A great way to get ideas. I am looking forward to seeing more detail in the symptom picker.,
"This app works well if you are wondering whether a trip to the doctor is worthwhile. Gives you a good indication of the severity of your problem. Doesn't have the symptoms of Arsenic Rash, though.",
"A very comprehensive medical tools, you will find satisfactory answer to your question & knowledge.",
"Been able to calm my nerves on one or two occasions. Solid app, no app is perfect, if you're looking for perfection in anything other than God...you're fooling yourself! Use this wisely and you'll get a lot out it!",
I find this app  very helpful in information of the medications I take. Also  helped me to refill my Walgreen prescription.,
Hey this aap is very useful. Plzzz add offline option this app so that we can use it without internet connection,
Not miscarriage all the time 20-30 0/0 of women do this dure 1st trimester no pain occurred,
"I love the symptom checker. Although now I check it every time something comes up. Other than turning into a hypochondriac, I enjoy this app.",
It helps me stay ahead of the game it tells me what with the medicine can do and what the medicine can't do is like having a medical book on my phone all the time.,
"Ended up having trichinosis after visiting the doctor, but parasitic infections are not in the database for the app. Would be nice to have a full medical index to work with.",
"This for find medication, description and there side effects.   Is not great in looking at medication and see pills and what they are.",
"I started to look at 5 health foods that weren't healthy.  Then got diverted  to some quackery about liver function. Uhh Yeah! I'm interested in advice on diet and healthy living, not pseudo science fiction.",
I really like the Symptom Checker feature. I use it a lot but have to remind myself that I probably don't have all of the diseases shown!,
Won't even let me open it. Useful online. Not so much as an app,
"Provided the best medical advice to my fiancee and saved my life, cannot thank enough. Merry Christmas.",
Very helpful and full of useful information.  Only thing I don't care for is when looking at a condition it brings you back to the As instead of the letter you were at.,
"My doctor diagnosed me with rheumatoid arthritis a week after WebMD did. My kidney infection, my cluster headaches; everything. This is my go-to guide.",
I take care of Hospice patients and this helps me learn about their medications and things that involve them.,
"Helped me identify a household spider bite, which wasn't life threatening, thank God",
You can just about look up everything you need to some things aren't on it.,
This app offers a starting point to begin to better understand symptoms and what they may mean.,
I'm not very keen on the new layout seems more complicated to use. And I wish there were more symptoms available,
"Cannot ask for better information on medical care & maintenance.  Always up to date with news and drug interactions,  etc. A must for everyone",
"For a WEBMD App, it should be a lot more complete and useful -- having a lot more useful tools for people to use and find out about their conditions!",
Its somewhat fun to learn and see all the different things that might be or might kit be wrong with someone.,
Other than the fact that I'm dying every time I type anything into this symptom checker app lol it's very informative üëç,
This app is fantastic. They did a great job on designing it as to help prevent people from thinking they somehow have a strange and rare disease.,
I was shocked that ehlers danlos syndrome isn't even on the list of conditions! Just as many people have EDS as narcolepsy or MS yet it is forgotten about. This urgently needs to be corrected.,
No other app is this good. Very detailed information. The symptom checker is phenomenal. I don't assume I have a deadly illness haha!,
Helpful until you can get to the doctors office. Wouldn't use to self diagnose.,
This app was very helpful to my staff at the Dr.Vannostrom clinic. Also insightful for my doctors at the H.E. Pennypacker foundation for a mole free society of well education provided by the feinklestein xo.  When everyone else realizes what it is like to baste a turkey ona hot june day than we can all have a picnic with the $miths.,
Every time I try to search a word/words describing a problem I get nothing. Please tell me if I am doing something wrong. At this time this app is useless.,
"I use this app a lot.  I do not use it to self diagnose, however, I use it to get an idea of whats going on or to read up on conditions.",
Very useful info on meds and ideas for the odd things that you didn't know about your body,
The information provided in this site are so detailed that it's difficult to stop once opened. Highly useful.,
This is an excellent app!! There has been no medical condition that I needed to look up for info that wasn't available in this app. It really is excellent for a quick and accurate details on I would bet any medical condition you might have.,
"I love this app.  Good info and can be found in multiple sites, here you can get it in one spot.",
It's amazing and very helpful for all the mobile users who couldn't reach medical emergency immediately.,
"Maybe don't have a ""download our app""  on the website.  So people who are sick right now can check right away",
For years I have used it on my desktop and now on my mobile phone. It provides easy access to useful  information pertaining to health issues.,
I find this app to be helpful and at the same I learn new things and it's very interesting...thanks.,
I have used Web MD to check symptoms and meds and have found it to be very useful and informative.,
This app is on point! Very accurate and gives you numerous choices regarding conditions. Gives you warnings if necessary as well to see a doctor.,
"It is good, because your information is right here dont have to go to the emergency room,quick and simple.",
Great application for looking up questions about medical stuff! Worked great for me to look up information on the different blood test my Dr. ordered. Also to ask my Dr. to do certain blood tests to rule out different things.,
Won't let you put multiple symptoms in so can't get a proper diagnosis,
It helps when I just need a quick awnser about something small. It also helps when I dont know where to start with narrowing dwn syptoms to get an idea on what to ask the Dr. to check for. Its really convenient & extremely helpful.,
"I love this app. Keeps me inform of all med advances, updates. If you subscribe the only thing is they send you too many emails, far too many",
I don't have any medical conditions and I rarely get sick but I do find this app very informative. I highly recommend this app.,
Excellent app. Isn't it technology great in so many ways. Web MD covers so many areas. Love the symptom checker.,
This app has great information on most ailments and diseases. Great for medical studies.,
All the information I have found on Web MD has been helpful for me. My physician recommend for me to use this site only for medical information.,
This help me so much. In knowing deep details on different disease s,
Would be better if you could change the age and gender do that you could use the app to look up symptoms for all family members.  I have to uninstall then reinstall to look up symptoms for my son with the current app.  Unless there's a trick I don't know about . . .,
"In the past I gave 5 stars cause I loved the symptom checker but since my recent update the symptom check is VERY vague and not helpful ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫HOWEVER THE MEDICATION (PILL LOOK UP) AND MEDICAL TERMS IS WONDERFUL‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫ I highly recommend for anyone who is taking a lot of different medicine to advance their knowledge, ppl who need to identify old pills and purpose, and those who need a quick examplanation on the terms doctors use",
"This app helps me confirm what my Doctor's tells me. But, all ways get a second opinion.",
"Love it so much I find myself  pretending with the symptom checker just to see what I can conjure up as fake illnesses, lmao.",
"As a medical researcher, this app is an excellent tool to have on my mobile phone. I can diagnose, look up prescriptions, its a 5 star quality educational app anyone with medical issues or knowledge MUST HAVE!",
"One thing that may help is including more pictures of different things. Like boils, different rashes, bumps, things like that.",
I would love this app if it had the fitness and nutrition planner inside it or it's own app. The website can be time consuming on a mobile device.,
Best app every has completely helped me in everything I need to know. Especially since I am a nursing student.,
"""Great reference site for when you have any questions or concerns about your health.""",
I use this app alot. I had alot of strange syptoms and had seen a few specialist. One specialist told me it was a brain tumor.  I put in all of my symptoms and it said something very different.  My PCP agreed with the diagnosis. I am feeling better,
Helps avoid drug interactions.   This and using only one pharmacy keeps the wires from getting crossed.,
Extremely helpful in many aspects of life. Been using for many years. User-friendly app; easy to navigate. Use it even more now due to sickness and medication. A primary app on my mobile device.,
there is some issues that can't be detected when find issues in direct spots. the list will not break down parts of the digestive track or ect. but overall it will assist in finding most causes.,
"For years we visit the website that sometimes for some mobiles it would take an eternity to load, now all you have to do is download the app and the information you are looking for, is with it is reach for almost everyone. Great app.",
"It gives me an idea at glance about symptoms, illnesses, diagnosis and treatments. It works for me.",
I use this weekly when I have medical situations arise in work.  It's great info at your fingertips and is very user friendly!  Probably the best engineered app I have ever used.,
Lots of info in one spot. Easier to use with more info & fewer bells & whistles than online version,
The app keeps crashing when you are reading the stories posted.   Please fix A.S.A.P. Thanks,
"I really like this app! If my Dr tells me what I have, I can go on this App and read more about it, like my own personal medical book. Thanks so much.",
Most of the information contained on this website is up to date &has the latest news from the Medical field.,
We need to know the mysteries of the human body so that we can work with our doctors towards the goal of excellent health.,
This app has helped me tremendously to be a well informed patient. It helps me to know when I should be particularly concerned about any particular health issue and pursue it further with my physician.,
Excellent in medical issues on patient level of understanding. Thanks for this knowledge so needed by us patients.....,
"Most the time, I can't get a diagnosis because the app doesn't understand my symptoms.  Sometimes it does well, though.",
"I find It so useful having older relatives, taking multiple medications. Or just finding that peace of mind when your body is not 100%",
I find this app handy in helping me understand & make better decisions regarding the health of my family.,
For peice of mind and free access to information that usually cost a doctor's visitand or money and time.,
Not helpful at all would be nice of I could type my symptoms in instead of having to choose from a general list of them...Thanks anyway,
I use this app to keep me in touch with my health status. Symptom Checker is where I usually start.,
This APP has come in handy many times for me and my family. Excellent advice and help in searching for answers. Keep up the good work.,
"While fetching condition information, the app continues to ""think"" for several minutes before I give up and Google it.",
I am currently in a rehab center and it helps me keep up with my medication and conditions.,
"I downloaded this as instructed per Walgreens to go a long with their healthy choices program. I installed per the instructions.   Said to select healthy target from the upper left menu. There is no upper left hand menu in the header which has health target listed. I cannot use this to track my progress as it says I can per Walgreens website, which lists WebMD as a sponsor!",
Would be great if it didnt spy on you through your camera. Guess its the in thing now to be spied on.,
"WebMD is a useful and informative source. However, in today's update I was asked to grant permission for WebMD to access my contacts. I was told, it already has access to my camera, location, storage and calls.  Wow!  Why so much access?   So my CNN h for HIPPA Privacy.  I am going to consider uninstalling.",
WebMD is a valuable resource especially when I have been diagnosed with a new condition by my doctor. It provides me with a great deal of information all in one place.,
A great tool to help you find out what your symptoms are in relationship with a possible diagnosis.,
When I have a question about medical issue it gives me peace of mind.,
"Like being able to loolook up medicine  and it's info, symptom checker is cool.  Looking up information on specific conditions or illnesses is helpful.",
It is far too easy to accidentally clear all the symptoms you've been putting into the symptom checker by hitting back one too many times. This is the only reason I use your app.,
"This has been my ""go to"" app for health issues for many years, however I have found a different one that is just as good.  I do wish that the app would let you get more specific about the afflicted areas.",
This app is incredible. I'm an medical assistant and I use the medicine section whenever I'm unsure of the generic or brand name of a medication.,
Love it's content used it often for just about everything related to health issues and the human body.,
"I listened to a Botdf song. After using this app, it proved what I already knew and feared: I have cancer",
Not a bad app at all. It can give you some reassurance if you can't get into a doctor right away and answer some questions you may have. Only thing.. why does it need your camera access? Bit weird to me.,
Helpful application but not very easy to navigate. Also cannot be compared to the full website,
"I have used this app to describe symptoms, all symptoms. Sometimes you don't realize the connections and don't mention important observations to your doctor.",
"For everything I have looked up on this site has been very informative, in layman's terms and answered my questions so far. A good app to have available.",
Great application with lots of good information.  Only problem Don't show how to connect to Walgreens.  With direction to connect to Walgreens would be a five star.,
"This is an awesome app. I can track my medication contradictions. Side effects, signs and symptom concerns. WOW!!",
"Health related easy to use application related to illnesses, injury, etc.",
OK for minor illness or injuries. Too limited for major issues.,
But I hate that I have to use this app instead of a Google search to the regular website...,
"excellent app especially if you have kids, need general health information, or want to follow health conditions. for the paranoid individuals who asked why the app needed camera permissions, it's because the app has a prescription barcode scanner to refill walgreens prescriptions. the app isn't going to spy on you.",
Rapid access to health information and symptom matching. Sometimes the avatar dialogue has controls in the way of body part selection.,
"It is useful and reliable, but hard to get the right area to come up when you use the immage.  I could never get the feet part to come up, I had to use the list at the top.",
This app is very useful. I've used it to get answers and information about medical things.,
"I use this app often for checking symptoms, especially related to children. The only thing that would make it better is to be able to check symptoms for children under a year.",
"This has helped us quite a bit. It gives us an idea of where to go next, depending on the symptoms.",
Web version is outstanding. The mobile version seems to keep trying to get you to sign up for the WebMD newsletters and does not bring in the personal health information that was entered on the web site. Am uninstalling.,
I accessed the site for the first time in a while and it added 50 pictures to my phone in a separate photo album. It was unauthorized and made me think the site was compromised.,
It's such a delight to have both an e- consultant and a  medical encyclopedia in your phone... Thumbs up,
I'm speechless. I recommend this for all human beings on Earth. Greatly Appreciated,
This application seems to have been designed for people with no medical knowledge. As a doctor it contains most superficial and deficient medical information that I need as a practitioner.  Long live Medscape!,
"I was having symptoms that I thought weren't so serious so I was waiting to talk to my Dr at an appt,  about week later. I decided to look up my symptoms on WebMD to get an idea of things to ask my Dr. As I was typing in my symptoms an alert popped up that said I should seek immediate medical attention and to go to an emergency room right away. So I called the hospital, spoke with a nurse, and she too told me to come in asap. Sure enough I had a very serious problem that couldn't wait.",
Great app for students and Health Professionals. It appears some medical words and some disease conditions are still missing but I absolutely like it and would recommend it to anyone for educational or knowledge enrichment.,
I used to diagnosis a pain symptom and bought proper medication.. it cured the symptom,
"Easy to understand, 2 dimensional body helps to pinpoint the problem... Overall, I'd install this app,rather than rely on Google so much",
Use it to put minds at ease and look up side effects of medications.,
I regularly utilize the symptom checker to get a rough idea of what might be wrong before I see my doctor.,
Im always on this app. When anyone ask me whats wrong with them. This is the app to go to find out.,
the screen is stuck on the loading icon,
"I have a few rare diseases and of course not to be found on this app. Addison's Disease, inappropriate sinus tachycardia come on. Like most the medical community there's no knowledge of these rare issues",
"Symptom checker doesn't return any results, just sits loading indefinitely. Samsung Galaxy Note Edge latest. Also, security permissions are a bit much, wants access to your camera and files.",
I love this app it's very easy to use,
"Usually it is helpful,  but when I put in all my pregnancy symptoms to test it,  it came up with some crazy condition I've never heard of.",
I like the information it provides. I hate guessing and this app. Provides direction to my guessing.,
I would recommend this app for all your formal medical questions and it has useful info about just about any medicine.,
I use the app everytime I need answers about my medication or symptoms I might be experiencing.,
Nice to look up information but sometimes they don't give information on what exactly you asked for.,
Looking dont lnow yet but i feel web md is most extensive in their info on the subject.,
iam using this app more than year since then i found its very very helpful for all. simple and user friendly design. simple language and easy to understand very details.,
I love this app. I can check any drug reactions any symptoms anything concerning health. Love it,
I like the older version. It use to be so easy to look up a med for clinical practice. Please bring back this feature. IslanMama.,
"Love all of the information that you can get on everything like medications, etc. BUT... the search tool does NOT work on any aspect of the app at all... Please fix ASAP.",
"Provides good preliminary info on possible physical ailments.  An excellent way to understand what medicines do for you, and an outstanding medical reference for non-medical people.",
This app is wonderful with medications and illness. The symptom checker is great as well but never self diagnosis. It's best to treat small injuries and to look up bigger injuries after being professional diagnosed.,
This is an excellent source of information regarding symptoms and conditions for the average person.,
I use it when patients come in with new unknown drugs and explore any visual side effects... good so far!,
"Having the RIGHT information, the appropriate response reguarding medication, wound care, prognosis and everything  i need to know while working with elders is vital to my job and vital to my patients.   Thank you.",
Loved the app but you do not need access to my contacts for anything. If I could bypass granting that access to update it I would. But since I can't I'm deleting it. Guess I'll just have to use the WebMD online if I need anything.,
"I type in my symptoms, and hit ""show possible conditions,"" and then it just shows a loading screen indefinitely. Doesn't do what it's supposed to do, therefor just 1 star until it is fixed.",
"I chose fatigue as my symptom, and it couldn't come up with any possible conditions. This is crap!",
"For years, WebMD has educated me in general health knowledge. The amount of information you provide is amazingly abundant. I became an informed person because of WebMD.",
The symptoms checker saved my husbands life. Thanks.,
Installed it more than four times but app never starts. Too disappointing.,
You don't need access to my contacts or call information to give me info that I search for.  I'm done with this.,
I love this app it showed me the possible things that could be wrong with me and it turned out that it was right. I would recommend this to everyone.,
"It's  fast and informative but i dont like,that you have to go back and start over when you are doing a  topic  like thyroid you have to start over  if you want to see thyroiditis",
I don't like the updated version but it is a handy app to have,
"The best app I've known for a med student, but could use an offline dictionary.",
"I love having medical information, especially regarding medicine, so easily available. And now that I'm taking Psychopharmacology, I really appreciate the availability.",
Good but dont get carried away because only a doctor can truly diagnose you.,
I love this app. So helpful with my diagnosis so I can get more detailed description.,
"It focuses on all medical issues that endures in family, that doctors neglect to say to you.",
Dr. Ghazi went out of his way for whar seems like my last surgery on my right arm.,
stupid.  It doesn't even list sore throat in the symptom checker,
Have asked if I could receive emails during business hours (GMT) but fell on deaf ears. Always woken up in the middle of the night with emails. Sent multiple requests with no reply.,
"I think this is great. I have learned soo much. This info.  was  instrumental in getting me to a doctor in advance, saving me alot of problems down the road.",
I find this app very useful. Most of the medical issues are well covered. It's a storehouse of knowledge which can be accessed easily. The explanations are concise & precise. Overall very useful for addressing our health concerns.,
Love the app not a fan of all the updates. Could give more medical conditions.,
"So nice to have a mostly easy accessible website to answer my million; and one, questions.",
It tells you what you need to know about your health and what you can do to help yourself.,
Easy to use for the most part. Only issue is the search results can't be narrowed to specific questions.,
"Complete and useful. Love the med terms feature, very useful at school. Keep it up and please don't mess it up when update it's more than good the way it is.",
I trust this site i always so tgeir if i had questions ir need answers when ut comes to my daughter 1st . loved it .,
"Good thing we had this on my husband phone , I need emergency care and didn't know this app truly saved my life",
I use this often to read on symptoms or anything else medical.,
Makes it easier to stay informed on your health issues and it's great to know what's going on.,
I installed this to use with Walgreen's balance rewards for healthy choices. I can't get to that feature because the upper left menu icon doesn't exist.,
"Very helpful. Of course being looked at by a medical doctor is best. But, this app is the next best thing.",
I am not able to change the profile in the symptoms checker section for other people to use the app on my phone. Please help !!,
It is a great reference tool for meds your not familiar with and things that happen within your body.,
Pretty good app to have its serving me quite well I always end up back reviewing my search results here so yes it would seem it's a go to when all common sense fails.My friend a nurse she is using it for drug interaction and instant access to critical info Like Now!,
Works well to keep informed on avoiding pain pill conflicts with Rx.,
Love the symptoms checker on there. Lots of information about almost every ailments,
Very good information that is explained in layman's terms. Covers a lot of illnesses in death.,
Useless. When ask to enter zip code/postal code there is no way to enter postal code wich has to include letters.,
I'm hadicapped this app is awsome I use it all the time very in formated saves me hospital visits I check the app first,
I'm always on WebMD because I like to research supplement ingredients before purchasing. The mobile app doesn't have an menu for searching for natural dietary supplement items like the website. You have to use the search tool instead.,
I would give it 5 stars if it didn't need access to my camera. That is kinda creepy.,
This is the best approach I have found for when I need a medical before I ask talk to a doctor. But does not replace seeing a docfor.,
"The info helps me manage my condition, HBP; knowledge puts you in control.",
I'm a neurologist and have recommended this site to hundreds of patients and families over the years as a good resource for them.,
This is one of the most useful apps I have. It's much easier to use on my phone than the website.,
Site is broken & app is broken. Neither will proceed past selecting the area with the problem. Have tried many times but I hope I can find another symptom checker elsewhere. This one's useless to me.,
"It's a very impressive app with one huge issue. When you input a list of symptoms, you receive a list of possible conditions but it is a list for every symptom you put in. It should be smart enough to only put conditions that might apply to all of the symptoms you put in.",
I love this app because it helps me to understand how to treat any medical conditions I have. Don't wanna live with out it!,
I use it always before I even think to go to a doctor. It is full with information that helps me recognize symptoms and learn how to manage my health issues. Really love it.,
"Love this app. It's easy to use and really informative. Of course its not a substitute for a doctor, but its perfect for firguring out minor aches and pains.",
WebMD is really good.  Side effects of meds has been my goal.   Its really good for all types of medical information.,
"When I want to check out another injury or symptoms, I have to individually delete the previous symptoms. It would b great if the deleting feature can have check boxes next to the symptoms so we can check multiple symptoms to be gone from our list and start over quickly.",
One of my favorite go to apps for practical and reliable information regarding my medical concerns. Highly recommend!!!,
I enjoy reading the information provided by WebMD has many medical topics. I am a retired nurse and so WebMD helps me keep up with changes going on.,
Just downloaded it for a few questions found out i use it more tha. I thought very infomative and resourceful,
"Medical Information , this site is my favorite for learning about my health issues. ..",
"Because of Web MD, I self diagnosed myself...I had Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer.  Doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong and I told them what I thought it was.  Tests confirmed.  Highly recommend.",
Great app. To Have On Your Cell,
For a quick info its ok. Gaps in info still exist.,
I would give it a 5 star but symptoms  checker not working.,
This app. has been very helpful  in finding out the good and bad of medications.,
"Very informative for a quick reference to various medical related subjects. Especially like the prescription information. When I was unsuccessful finding my prescription on another app, I tried Web Med and immediately found the information.",
Should just be able to use the mobile site without downloading the app. Do not like that I kept being redirected to the page telling me to download the app.,
This is just one of life's necessities. Very helpful when looking for information before speaking to a doctor.,
"I like it, I use it often enough BUT sometimes its not as informative as it could be.",
"Good app iverall, but kept randomly adding photos to my photo folder, so all the sudden I'd have CPR images and photos of warts in my drive. Ugh! Just use the browser interface.",
This is a really good Resource. I have found it very informational and able to do the next right thing.,
Highly helpful.  In every health matter. Very very helpful . It's practically a doctor . Without paying consultation fees,
I love this app! I have recently gone back to school and I find myself using it a lot!,
Is a convenience to have just in case you need 411 in anything. I love the app and is very helpful.,
I like the app for most things. I never seem to be able to get the symptom checker to work right tho,
"This app provides excellent, easy-to-read details about a plethora of medications (including side effects and other drug interactions) and illnesses without me searching on Google.",
When ever I have a symptom this is the first place I look. That way I am well aware of everything when I see my doctor!,
I'm getting this app because it will add 250 reward points to my Walgreens health account. The app also is very helpful in quickly providing information - Thanks!,
This app helps me very much regarding definitions of my vast medical issues.,
"Large app, took a long time to d/l, didn't answer my question. I'll stick w the regular website when I need it.",
Crap,
I've always relied on WebMD (&  Mayoclinic) tho of late I know someone that was steered wrong there re her son's cancer,
"This app has helped my family out, when we need to know if our symptoms were serious or not. I enjoy this app!",
Allows you the ability to search medications and symptoms. I find it useful and accurate.,

Disappointed,
I tested to see if the common conditions matched up with conditions I already knew I had to see if it was right and it always was!,
"Valuable source of information for any health professional and such a help to me with continuing education, legal cases, and other things as well as day to day practice.",
Didn't use it too often but so far this app provided or give me answer I was looking for,
Good enough to get simple basic info regarding symptoms and minor injury. Wouldnt say it replaces doctor but quick fast accessible medi guide.,
This app gives you an idea what your symptoms might mean and how serious they are so a decision can be made about medicine and/or medical care.,
"This apt. Is very help full, but you still need to see your Doctor.",
"It is obvious that without proper medical consultation and test, one cannot get conclusive about the medical problem, yet with help of this app...one can get knowledge of probable causes of the illness! I say, this is a very good app in the feild of medicine!",
"Sorry but this update wants access to my contacts, and all phone call data/information.  You simply don't need this private info just for a med app.  Red flag!  Uninstall.  C ya!  Will use iTriage instead!",
A doctor told me today I had a little protein in my urine and this app is unable to tell me what that means...,
My favorite part is the body ya can add symptoms and it'll tell you all of the possible causes. Great app,
I like  it  and  I  can  get  in  the  information  that I can  find  out what  can  be  used for and what  else  to do with health  issue  .,
"Very Good! Gives you Symptoms and what They could be the Cause of. Also shows a persons' (male or female) body, where you can Show where it ""Hurts"" and the Causes will be explained!",
"So far,so good ! I  like the fact that you can store all of your meds securely and also keep track of what you are taking. I  just downloaded the app so I  really need more time before I can give a objective opinion.",
99.9 % of anything that I've looked up under Web MD I've found an answer for.,
I love it I worked in the medical field for 25 years. I was an RN I loved my job & WeB MD keeps updated on medical issues,
"In a pinch...find a doctor, a pharmacy, check symptoms and locate hospitals with a few clicks and get directions to ease your stress.",
I found app no useful. Content is not well arranged. UI SHOULD be better.,
I love this app because it helps me when my family are not feeling well  .so is a good app to have  it comes out handy,
Satisfied to a great extent...  It would be very nice if the developers can include a test calculator which can predict the condition on the input of various test values..,

"Fantastic app. A wide variety of easily accessible and understandable information. I have installed this time and time again after every new phone purchase. Never lags, never gives you misleading information, never a single hiccup in the app when it's running or any time really. Worth it absolutely! Love it and recommended it to many friends and family. Great work, keep it up and thank you.",
"I'm in need of finding out info regarding raynauds syndrome & scloderma, this is the app I've found out info so far",

I can look up meds while with the pt. To check for interactions and side effect.It's very helpful to me and my patients.,
I trust this app to give me accurate medical advice and information about different diseases. It should not be used in place of a doctor! It's great if you just need questions answered.,
You pretty much have to know what you have for a diagnosis but definitely can help with confirming before seeing a doctor.,
It would be better if you could delete multiple symptoms at once.,
It's a royal pain as an app on my phone!! Allows me to type a subject in the search field. But when I click the magnifying glass for it to death it does absolutely NOTHING regardless of what subject I type .,
Use it daily. Get answers and suggestions for a much better life. My cholesterol and BP are both way down from what they were because of the information I get from Web M.D.!,
Learned more about my heart failure from WebMD then my Dr's very glad I found out about this.,
The WebMD app is a wonderful program that allows the regular everyday citizen who may not have any medical background or medical knowledge to be able to understand in Easy terms with documentation written by doctors so that you can see what it is that you are looking at when it comes to your own bodies.,
It should be noted that my human doctor get things right.... just that WebMD gives me an array of options and makes me prepared for what are the things my Doc will say. Love it!,
Somewhat helpful. Need to break down the Doctors terminology. To understand explanation better..,
"There's places on me that I try and point put in the diagram, but doesn't list as possible issues.",
I just need to spend more time with the app before I can give it a 5 star rating.   So far its proven useful.,
"It has a large amount of information ranging from info about conditions to doctors, very helpful.",
If I don't understand this is a great way to research your health to explain to doctors.,
"Great to look up meds, but symptoms not to much..",
This app with just Self awareness to your symptoms can dictate the doctors brainstorming and narrow the line on self assurance to your best course of action for a better life style. Just remember not to be obsessed,
Symptom checker doesn‚Äôt find many diagnoses.   Pretty good articles though.,
I am very pleased with the simple interface and wealth of information provided by the app. I will continue to use it in the future.,
"Symptom checker by tapping on body area is, at best, inaccurate. Full zoom in is a bit better.",
It helps with my type two diabetes symptoms... And more,
Tons of information and very helpful. From minor to major health problems,
I have diagnosed almost everyone in my family with this app even when the doctors couldn't figure it out,
"I like it, I can type in symptoms and it either confirms what I expected or tells me what I didn't know wish the android version would let me just type in symptoms sometimes instead of giving a prewritten list too choose from",
"I don't recommend you use this instead of seeing an actual doctor, but it is really useful for looking up first aid and coming up with a list of symptoms for your doctor.",
It can identify a lot of conditions but some features can only be used if you live within the United states...,
"It started with WebMD deciding a keyboard was wrong for entering a postal code, went into an ankle deep interface that looks like it's out of the late 90s and ends with a 1 star rating. Bleach.",
The best app I found in the field of helth. It is very useful and user friendly.,
Very informative and helpful: Dizziness And legs numbness,
"I have always used Web MD for all my references for medical needs, information, and the latest in researchstudies. It is truly the best unbiased, ethical and honest web site to research on. Thank you, WebMD!",
It's for confirming the doses and side effects,
I like that you can enter multiple symptoms to narrow down what may be causing them. And unlike many websites out there the first thing listed is not always cancer but rather more likely diagnoses.,
Nice to have to use the symptom checker if needed. Overall I like the app.,
"A trusted, go-to source for medical advice. Great help in determining next steps. Sometimes the search isn't the best but it's good overall.",
"While this app does not replace the need for doctors or exams, it's very informative about possible conditions based on symptoms.",

"For a person w/ many medical issues ,it is nice to be able to check doctors opinions ,symptoms as well as medicines involved w/ my treatment .

Helps plan a place to begin researching health issues.,
There has been an update to this app and now I can't change the profile to a woman. I use this app for my family and sometimes it's nice to toggle between the two genders. Please update so the profile is easily accessible. Thanks.,
A little laggy. Login using PIN doesn't work.,
"Love this app! Fyi... for those of you who think you can only put one symptom in, you're incorrect. There's a little plus sign up in the right hand corner of the symptom checker, hit that and you will be able to add more symptoms. Just a little helpful hint. :)",
Pretty close to having a doctor explain  ailments and other issues to you,
"Greatest reference tool ever. However as always, it goes without saying I would think, that it is not for diagnostic purposes.",
I've gotten a lot of interesting medical information from this app.  And many questions for me to ask my doctors on my next appointment.   Very interesting + informative. Learn more about a diagnosis. Learn questions to ask your doctors.,
Its like asking a magic 8 ball whats wrong with you..go see your doctor,

Check out the permissions requested. It wants access to EVERYTHING.,

It helped me get diagnosed and figure out what could be wrong with close friends.,
Why do I have to use the app for system checker it's better online and this app is a waste of space,
This app is quick and easy to use and does not take up much space on my phone.,
"As an RN, I need access to reliable information with references to share with my patients. I love how easy it is to navigate this app.",
"As a nurse, I'm very pleased with how reliable this app is, especially in a clinical sense and setting.  Well done to the developersüëå. However, please make internal searches easier.",
Serves my needs which are mostly looking up side effects. Thanks Web MD,

Even though it always says im dying I love this app saves me alot of $,
This app is great I put my symptoms in and get a general idea whats going on with me and since I became a paraplegic 2 years ago I cant always get to my doctors office and since I have a nurse who comes out 3 times a week I can tell her whats going on and she calls my doctor and tells him whats going on and we go from there simple things like bronchitis he calls meds into the pharmacy and my dad picks them up or if he wants me to come in I text my dad and I have my dad take me in after work,
So far it has been spot on with my symptom diagnosis.,
"I look up everything on WebMD. I use the symptom checker, the drug identifier & side effects.  It is a must have on my phone.",

I love the convenience of being able to find out most medical and allergy information.,
"With the latest update (Dec '16) comes extra (unnecessary) permissions. Why do you now need access to my contacts? Why do you need my phone id? Why do you need my call information?

There are so many experts around who know nothing really so its nice to get a bit of factual help for things that you need to clarify.,
It provides the essential points and concise analysis and records of health issues. Very educative.,
Do not download if you like your privacy it baffles me why your have to agree to let some organization you only just heard of minutes before have unrestricted access to lots of private and personal information even photos I don't see how it is relevant in any way shape or from a person asking for medical information makes the need for invasion of someone's data stored within their phone,

This app is okay for quick reference. Although my daughter and I joke that everytime we look something up it says we have cancer. The real negative for me is all the files it leaves that have to be deleted occasionally to free up space. They look like files regarding the information we've looked up. So I don't use it as much as I would like.,
Sometimes I think the language is a little too simple. I wish they'd explain things more deeply.,
"It's a good place for helpful information.  Also, lets you know when you need to get to the doctor.",
"This update is 100 x better than the old app, keep up the good work! To the general public: I would only use this app as a quick reference guide and not count it as the Bible of Medicine.",
"An applaudable effort by the app makers... easily stands on top of the list of""service to the netizens""...",
Does and gives info how it sayd,
Could use more terms that my doctor uses.,
Like the new look,
"I really like this app because it has information about every thing that ome could think of. However, I would really appreciate if a benefits tab is added for lets say vitamins...the general benefits which I would get when I will consume them. The same applies to surgies. The article will become somewhat interesting if these points are elaborated well.",
"It could be more specific and give more options as to what you might have instead of asking one question and then going back to add more symptoms. Be specific about your symptoms give a more specific or optional problem. EX: I am bleeding, have a fever, headache and a cut (in a different order)... I don't have a disease.. Try infection first",
"This app is good for saving a list of medications. Also, if you don't want to share this info & something happens, you can save medical history & make sure someone (family member, spouse, close friend, etc.) has your pin & they can retrieve that information for a doctor during an emergency.  Several positive aspects with having this app available on your mobile devices.",
"I'd hoped that it would allow a few more specific symptoms or an option to enter a symptom & have the app offer suggestions of symptom. I know that this app needs to use broad strokes so folks don't try to replace Doc visits. But the more informed you are prior to a Doc visit, the better you can help with diagnosis.",
"As a kidney and pancreas transplant patient, as well was having had a valve replacement, this app has been a superb help with meds, symptoms and everything I need to stay on top of the game plan of making the most out of life!  Thanks a million and keep up the great work - you are truly making a difference.",
"I was uploading my pictures to my computer and noticed a bunch of things that were random and shouldn't be on my phone. After looking into it, I find a ""webmd"" folder with 270 pictures/documents. Not sure where you get off saving stuff to my phone, but you're app is deleted and will never come back on my phone.",
I had peeling skin and on my hands and for fun i used this app and it told me i had toxic shock syndrome.... but as it turns out it was just an allergy to the new soap ive been using.... i wouldn't recomend it for hypochondriac s such as myself,
"App has a lot of useful information and isn't buggy, though I haven't used it a lot. Would give a fifth star if it didn't have ad's (or could at least pay a small amount to get rid of them) and also if it had better resolution, doesn't look super great on my S5. In the end, the app works and everybody should have it for reference.",
"These know it all are not allowing users to type in the symptoms they are having. Instead they have to choose from a limited list of symptoms which some may close to the symptoms the user is experiencing.  For instance,  I have green stool all the time.  There's no listed symptom for green stool.W T F Web md. What about green stool. There was a listing for fowl smelling stool mine is mild smelling small and floats about five times a night. Not day. So if anyone from Web md can explain to raymondquerns@gmail",
the Android app does not work as it promises. It does not keep track of Personal conditions or personal medications as it says it does.there is supposed to be a plus sign to tap in order to add drug information or condition information to my personal conditions and medications but there is no plus sign the whole thing is a total waste of time I'm going to take it off my phone I'm sorry I wasted,
"My 18 son has been to 3 different hospitals,  seen all kinds of doctors, and no one could tell him why his throat was sore or why he was having trouble swallowing.  After several mis diagnosis,  I downloaded this app, when through the symptom checker and I finally got a possible diagnosis.  In the end it was tonsilitis.  Not bronchitis that was  previously diagnosed.",
I think web md is the most accurate you're ever gonna get when it comes to self diagnosis.... The others features are great and I like being able to look up pills because I hate taking medicine and like to double check what the pharmacy gives me or my son.,
So therefore I can't afford to go to the doctor.  :-/  The Symptom Checker app put out by Harvard asks you if you have any of these problems and just tells you to see a doctor.  This app asks you more questions and explains to you what may be happening!!!  Now I can look for other problems and decide what to do after that.  This is far more informative.  If you sneeze and want someone to tell you to go to the doctor use the other app.  If you want more info then use this one!,
"not only it does NOT accomplish what it is supposed to do but creates confusion.  It's like using a fire extinguisher but instead of turning an existing fire out you risk creating a new fire. Worthless app...... should be removed. If used, it can do more damage than any good. Another respectable site that has turned bad - what a shame!",
"Loved this app until this latest update. Twice now I have  had an error pop up but it prevents me from shutting the phone down, rebooting, answering the phone etc. All I can do is remove the battery to stop it. Once I start up the phone I see a ghost like icon ut it doesn't work so I have to download it again. 1 day later it did it again so now I am going to have to uninstall it, unfortunately but I cant use it like this.",
"Was expecting health information that is available on the website - like articles on nutritional values of foods and the facts vs myths, etc. I can't seem to find that information on the app. For everything else it might be good but I don't need it for those functions right now.",
"There are a few flaws, such as: when you enter in symptoms of (ie. The flu) you will get answers for everything ranging from the normal headache to possibly having c.o.p.d. also when u enter in pain or swelling on a certain body part (ie. Your foot is swollen) you'll get everything from a broken foot/toe to arthritis and or being pregnant as your possible answers to whats wrong with you.  They really should design a different way of categorizing symtoms or not offer information whats so ever for  emergency",
"Mediocre. It served it's purpose for my very minor condition and confirmed my suspicions. Where this app falls short is design. Being an avid technology user, I couldn't help but be annoyed by the apps archaic interface and clunky selection mechanic. It's 2014, update the interface ! It needs more fluidity !",
Not 100% sure if I found out what I was going through. Symptoms need more options and each diagnosis or illness should name at least 1 picture example if there are visible symptoms. And maybe other possible similar illness.,
The only Doctors I trust . I recommend this app to anyone young and old. They really should make it mandatory on all phones or devices it could save a life someday when unexpected emergency happen  you will always have a personalized Robot Doctor on your side giving answers and guidance,
"Old user interface with no menu button so harder to use on galaxy S5.  Then the drug information never loads no uses, interactions, side effects, etc.   But the ads load promptly.",
"If saving medication and conditions is what this is used for, shouldn't you be able to save your dosage and other pertinent information like you are able to on the web browser (mobile browser included). Fix for more stars or there is no reason to have the app just login online asks have better access",
"The list of specialties under the Doctor Search is at too high a level.  If you are looking for a doctor who practices in a specific area of treatment, you will not be successful. For instance, if looking for a doctor who is trained in and practices Osteopathic Manipulation Therapy, you will have to revert to other sources.  Of course, if you are just looking for a family doctor, the search gives you several from which to pick.",
"It wants to know where you're affected, yet it only gives you basic choices. I'm having a problem on my entire left side, head to toe, only the left. I was hoping to find out what it could be, but of course this app is of absolutely zero use to me.",
"This App is brilliant. It needs to be one of those essential Apps on your device so you can quickly refer to it if you or someone with you has symptoms that on there own seem trivial, but together add up to something more serious.",
"You have to read through every symptom for each general area to find the specific wording of your symptom, and even then it's frustratingly hard to find what you're looking for (is sore throat under neck or mouth? Neither as far as I could tell. Lack of appetite? Not under general symptoms or upper abdomen.) Maybe I'm stupid but a search function, like on the website, would make this much easier.",
Sometimes you don't know what medications are for. I happened to look through my cabinets one day and found that my ex-wife was lying about a medication that was being taken in the house. Thanks Web md. I found depression and anxiety pills. Never knew anyone was depressed and taking pills in the house. Now I could finally understand why I was seeing the behaviors I was seing. She's out of my house finally and I can live free without lies and hidden anxieties! Thanks again.,
"I  have MULTIPLE health issues that started at an early age. Because of these issues, I have to see many different doctors.  I use WebMD to personally check symptoms and side effects along with the interactions of other meds. I also use this site to assure that I am not taking a medication that can cause difficulties with other health issues I have. When you have multiple health problems and many doctors, you can't just assume that every doctor knows whats best and safe to use. WebMD provides info on it all",
"I wanted to try out the app myself and I am disappointed, but in a funny way.    After putting in a few symptoms like (headache, neck pain, heart palpitations, and chest pain), one of my top answers was. ""Heart Rhythm. Disorder"" What?   Otherwise a helpful app if you have a serious condition you are unaware of, but shouldn't you be at a doctor then?",
For over a year I loved this app & relied heavily on it as I am disabled & unfortunately on many meds. I used it to educate myself about them & to keep an eye out for any bad interactions. That is I did do all this untill abt. 3 monthes ago wen it stopped working on my android phone. So sad.,
"No,It's not a doctor,but it's very helpful for giving you an idea of what could be the problem(s),which is sort of like a prediagnosis. Still you will need to see an actual doctor for your concerns or issues. Good health to you all.",
The Saved folder has no function on my android so I can't save a list of my symptoms. Please fix this. Other than that it's got a lot of useful information about possible conditions,
It has been my personal doctor right now. Amazing app. Though you may enrich the app with more info. Thanks a lot. Keep it up guys.,
Haven't any problems with this app neither do I have any complaints about webmd. It's very helpful and comes in handy for everything I've I needed when I need it. My daughter told me about this app and my doctor highly recommended it to me as well.,
This is a worthless app. I entered my information into the app regarding address and the app tells me that I have entered invalid Information. Won't tell me want info I entered that is invalid and I can't get out without deleting the app.,
"I've only had this app for like 2 days and have had a need to use it already about 5 times. I have always loved and used WebMD, and I really enjoy having it so instantly accessible all the time.",
"Very difficult to use. Instead of typing your symptom, you hv to scrole through a long list (& not find ur symptom !!!). Thats the last thing i want to do when im sick ! Hope it will be useful if we can type the symptom & select from a suggested list or something.",
I just don't understand why the app would need to directly make phone calls without my intervention.,
I downloaded hoping I could track my meals and activity but the app doesn't include the food & fitness planner. Very disappointed.,
Difficult to sign up; then I got their welcome email - tried to log in but got an invalid address error. Bloat;back to Google.,
"I receive email updates with recipes from signing up on the web site. It kept encouraging me to get the phone app. Downloaded but disappointed as it doesn't provide the recipes, weight loss and weigh in like the main web site does. Immediately uninstalled.",
Need to be able to include dosages in saved drug list.  Not much good if you only know what you're taking and not how much and when.,
"Missing a lot of drug info, many not listed. Tried to look up novocaine, not listed. Epinephrine, not listed. I understand Novocaine is not used anyone but it should still be listed.",
"Good app but I was looking for personality disorders and it misses almost all of them (except one). I'm sure it misses other stuff too, that's why it needs to be improved.",
"I suffer from Lupus, epilepsy, and rheumatoid arthritis. It helps when I'm going through something, unsure which disease it's related to.",
"Love the app, but I wish there was a way to set the default to a-z instead of top searches.",
Excellent Best Android Application worldwife for Public Health Education and Medical Information in a nut shell easy digested and Understood.Thanks a lot for A Great work in Public Health Medicine. Dr.Sameh Nashid MD Infectious Diseases Specialist,
"II find this app very useful especially my wife, she likes it because of the ability to view drugs, she used to work in a drugstore.",
"This app would be great if I drank or drugged up on asprin. Possible diagnosis intoxication from the last glass of wine I drank in March 2014?? It is October it asked if alcohol makes it worse,  why yes that's why I don't drink FYI alcohol did nothing to my symptoms the night I drank a glass of wine.  It was the week after that my symptoms were aggravated.  Stupid app  better than a doctor who knows you better than you know yourself.",
It will be finished downloading then say error can't install to device. I have a Galaxy S3 and Idk if its a memory issue or the app.,
Great reference  app. I wish they had an option to take a picture of our issue and help identify it that way. Rashes and burns are hard to identify by questions.,
"Every time I try to download the app to my phone all I get is an error msg saying ""can not download to phone or SD card""....",
Webmd is an all i. 1 app And its easy to read and sends emails re: on ur medical conditions . very helpful i say dwnld it ttyl bye,
Love it. Helps me decide if we need a trip to the Er or wait for doctor,
Not very user friendly. Usually always get the wrong conditions. The only reason I use it is to read the articles. That is why I gave it 3 stars.,
An app like this is very important especially if you can have it on your cell phone when and if you ever need it...,
This is the one medical related appt you should have on your computer if you have any.  It's an excellent reference tool.,
"This is a horrible way to check conditions by listing symptoms. I can not input specifics of where the pain/infection is located, everything is extensively and utterly vague. All I wanted to do was figure out why one tonsil is swollen.",
Very useful service but the app should be visually more pleasing in my opinion. That's my only complaint.,
It doesen't tell the medicine after going through the symptoms. It should tell the medicine too when we find out the symptoms.,
Unable  pinch and zoom in on Galaxy Note 4. Very odd.  Brand new phone.  Worked okay on old Droid Charge running gingerbread. Very disappointed.,
"Impossible to link multiple symptoms for a query. If on Android, website diverts searches to a plug for this app. Tried it finally after avoiding WebMD. Limited and frustrating.",
Trying t set up the App and it doesn't seem to support non-US addresses and it won't let me back out of the screen with it blank.,
This app is not good and WebMD is most definitely not what it used to be. Can't find common issues that are easily available by simple Google searches.,
"Very helpful, them only problem is that the app puts so much junk on your device. Im talking about pictures of cpr and other stuff. Just take a look on your device and you'll see what I mean.",
"When I look up paranoid personality disorder from my web browser, the search results show it in webmd. When I used the app, no results for the above disorder. :'(",
I found this apps very helpful for my  family . esp when my kids sick and i dont know the symptom i just browse on this apps. And the advise are helpful.,
Add links to access app and website to each other would be better. The app is not a user friendly as it could be. You may want to consider a section that includes meds you're allergic to. Having it altogether is more convenient.,
Vomiting isn't even in the list of symptoms. This has got to be one of the crappiest health apps.,
"The symptoms checker is nice but the app doesn't use the same search engine as the website. I tried to put in my medication ""no results found"". Yet when i go to the website it has all the information listed. The same goes for medical conditions. The information needs to be linked.",
Downloaded pretty fast. Want it for First Aid mostly. Never know when someone or self needs help.,
"A good reference to turn to when feeling under the weather. The app could look a bit nicer though, the design looks a bit dated..",
I love the webmd site but this didn't work. I have pain in both arms but doesn't let me pick both. It's also not as detailed as the website...I couldn't choose specific parts of the head/face.,
Has most of my ailments.. Cannot look up high cholesterol on the app have to go to the website to find anything on high cholesterol or triglycerides..,
I used web md when i got sick abroad. Symptoms showed i had strep infection. Really helpful.,
I love this app! I have a chronic illness and this app helps me to manage and stay informed about my various conditions as well as the symptoms and treatment of each one. It is a very valuable tool for the management of my illness and is very user-friendly.,
"Many of medicine is not listed in dictionary about 35% common medicine is not listed  ,  that make no sense, this apps need huge update,  otherwise its not so much useful, so I just give only 1 start.....",
I was curious I looked up to see if ankylosing spondylitis was there and it's not. I know it's not common for ppl to have but you should update your site.  Not have selective conditions only. So what my condition is not worthy on ur app??,
Worst map of ever used didn't even give me the right diagnosis and window looked up a common symptoms from the 19 twenty's there is no overview or articles found,
There is little incentive to use this when (1) the website is far more informative; (2) the app lacks an effective search engine (e.g. word search) and; (3) it is too focused on North America (e.g. only two kinds of spider bites are listed).,
The Web cite has tools for taking blood sugar and other things. This rises to be a great app when those tools are added.,
App works just fine. Turns out it's taking all your private symptoms data and searches and selling it.,
Always turned to Web MD for any symptoms I've had or family members had.. good to be aware of certain conditions and super glad they have an app  now.,
"I love this app. Sometimes I look up stuff just for the fun of it. I'm learning so much about things, healthwise, I never really thought of.",
This app's gotten every little detail in the book for a broad range of medical circs. Comes in handy when you need a quick point of reference for urgent medical situations.,
It's nice to have an idea what I could be dealing with and if I really need to see a doc or if I can wait it out a day or so and go from there. Healthcare is expensive!,
Not much use in the UK. A great shame. Insists on zip code etc so can't sign up.,
Great I rely on it when i don't where exactly were my family member s pain is exactly.,
"Sounds like a good program, but always crashes, keep trying to reinstall. Nothing is working. Even factory reset. Must not work well on Galaxy phones.",
No menu appears on android version when trying to save.  Will uninstall,
"Everyone should have this app. From tests and procedures, medical terms, conditions, medicines and so much more.",
"This app would be a lot more useful if you included a general look up search bar like on your website.  If I'm just plain missing it, please make it more visible?",
"Can't register, multiple attempts, poor feedback from the software so at a loss on what to do. Sent a message until then the app will be uninstalled.",
Very disappointed. Trying to check symptoms and I get propaganda for ACA. SMH. Uninstalling.,
Doesnt give any usefull information. Very limited to the choices you can choose from when trying to figure out what is wrong. This is a complete waste of time. Dont even bother with this useless app.,
"Last update (1/11/2015), getting error message ""Couldn't install on USB storage or SD card"" over and over.  What does this mean and what can I do about it? Isn't this the perfect time for a pop-up help message to appear? But alas, I just get the error no help. Any suggestions, anyone?",
It is very agonizing to tap a selected body part and scroll through a possible list of all conditions. I can just google and come up with answers much faster. Good concept bad implementation.,
I use this app to check out the side effects of medication prescribed by my GP and also any interactions with  other prescribed medications.,
Some meds have funny markings don't know if it's how I install info or site doesn't recognize Info,
Web M.D. helps you with your Health and any RX's you might be put on. Great App get it don't think,
It helps you to make the right decisions about when you should see the doctor and what questions you should be asking  him/her for further information,
I have really enjoy this  appt because it has been helpful with me finding answers to many illnesses.,
Not really helpful. It doesn't offer as much detail as is there on the website. Good only for a quick go-to or consultation.,
"I just downloaded this app and I'm stuck in the Settings, unable to get back to the rest of the app. Will be Uninstalling",
Not very User Friendly. I needed information about a vitamin and just got the run around.   Whats funny is the Internet sent me to WebMd for the information that I needed.,
"Needs to be updated. Very useful info on most topics cept for some NEEDS UPDATED for 2015, please then I will give 5+stars",
good appbut I needed info did not want the app. The only way to get help,
It seems that this is for those whose live in US only.  It doesn't accept my address.,
The website was better but that just directs you to this app or to another now. Disappointing because I can't even search my symptoms.,
Of course I'm a hypochondriac so it's not wise to spend any time on this app for me,
"I use this on my computer. It's a good start, however, out will always send our recommend you too a physician",
I live in south africa and it wont allow me to sign up as we dont have zip codes but postal codes. It also does not allow you to to tipe in you country.,
This application has so many  great features I truly love it. Helps keep me in the know on my conditions and medicine I take. Totally recommend for everyone!,
"BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT HAD A MAP THAT EVERY ONE COULD SAY WHAT SYMPTOMS WE HAVE AND IF WERE SICK , IT WOULD LET US KNOW IN OUR AREA OR IF WE WERE TRAVILING SOME WHERE WHAT COLD OR STOMACH VIRUS WAS GOING AROUND ! IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER",
It helps you to diagnose your health condition based on the symptoms you have......,
Not recommend.,
There should be a pregnant input. I would like to know if my symptoms are relayed to my pregnancy or not. Also how to treat while pregnant and  anything else that maybe related like what  drugs to avoid.,
"It gives me information about my condition in which i had just taken for granted since 2008,, i had learned that i had DEEP VIEN THROMBOSIS,,,",
I like your website. It is so informative. Kindly let me know how I could spare a little donation to your association as a small appreciation support for providing us the basic knowledge of healthcare. Thank you.,
I can't give the app many stars because I only used it for 6 minutes,
Completely trustworthy. I wouldn't use any other site for such important info.,
Please let me have the option to use the symptom checker without having to download the app as I used it is horrible and very slow and will not record my symptoms I tried using it on my mobile  web browser but it only gave me the option to download app!!! üëé I am definitely uninstalling it.,
Difficulty creating acct. Was easy with WebMD pain coach.. grr,
Works quickly to offer possible or related issues for a specific symptom you may be experiencing.,
American centric. Unable to locate hospital in my area. Have to put in numerical zip code to sign up. Not for U.K.,
There is no search option. You have to scroll through endless lists hoping to find the symptoms you have. I gave up trying to find one of my main symptoms. Almost a great app. Almost.,
This is one of the best medical apps to download if you want to just check something medical out our you want to go and learn something. This app can do it all in the medical area.,
Web med is most captivating              aap for all health professionals. The content is superb with certainity. I am deadsure that u ll love it ..,
"not everyone's MS is the same, I struggle with memory, focused and completing tasks, fatigue, and depression. so when I have chaos and stress in my life it is is a life changer. this app helps me to document symptoms as they happen daily. it is a wonderful tool for my doctor  to help with treatment and management.",
I love it. Have been using it for 5 yrs now!  No issues and always helps answer simple questions,
I DOWN LOADED   THE APP FOR A TRIP . DUE TO HAVING A SMALL CHILD GOING ALONG. THANK GOODNESS IT WAS LITERALLY AT THE PALM OF OUR HANDS.,
The site is good easy to find stuff not many abs they stay away. Nothing fancy to slow u done when u need. Give it a try,
"I have different medical problems and I love this app cause if I have a question about one of my medications or any symptoms, I can get on the app and trust the answers. Love how easy it is to use and "" My medication"" option.",
Can you guys fix it where we can view the reviews of meds. I think that info is important for the app as well as for desk tops.,
Tried saving my conditions and medications but unable to do that. There is no SAVE THIS on the MENU like it says there is.,
"This is a good website, except for a place where we can type in what we are looking for because sometimes you don't have my issue listed.",
I love web md it helps me ou so much especially to look up all the different type of medication I'm taking,
"feels dated and slow,  like it's still using the cupcake api level (and the screenshots support this theory) . images are blurry on modern devices.  could use some revisiting of the ux",
A quick handy tool when I need to look up my kids symptoms and diagnosis. If it's mild and if can lead to something serious.,
"Pretty accurate for a mobile app. Helps in understanding various diseases, conditions, disorders, traumas etc.",
"A great tool to have if you have an injury, symptoms, or  diseasr/disability. Accident prone kids? Are you regularly around anyone prone to injury/illness? Good app to look up almost anything related to the body as you need it.",
Can't even save symptoms as device doesn't have a menu button. To vague. Articles need current updating.,
Helps to diagnose and inform you of possible health concerns. One of my must have application. Luckily I don't use it a lot but glad that it's available when I do need it.,
My grand daughter has food allergies to dyes in foods.  Her symptoms change all the time!  Web MD was very helpful.,
This apps does not offer everything to what WebMD on my Computer does. Typed in a drugs name and ID and it could not find a match..... NOT good. Would have gave all five stars.,
"Complete from A to Z. You can search symptoms and definitions of certain medical conditions. Plus, search the definitions and uses of medicines and drugs.",
Haven't had a problem or question this site couldn't answer yet. Love it.,
Wish I could make a profile and personalise the app however it seems that if you don't have a zip code you can't ... I live in the UK :(,
"It doesn't allow for typing SPECIFIC health issues, it only allows for a pre - existing template to choose from",
I'll give it 5 stars when it actually lets me into the app Very disappointed,
"I had painful bowel movements, a cough, and a headache in the symptom checker. The app said that I had a tension headache, but the description given said nothing about my other symptoms. This either means that it is a poorly made medical search engine, or the app is implying that the other symptoms are normal. Not happy with either scenario.",
"Very good overall, but lacking in overview info on some topics.",
"The search engine is horrible, hard to use and confusing. This its not user friendly at all.",
"U made this app more difficult to access now with email, username,  pin! This is not necessary to obtain basic health information! I won't be using this anymore!",
I have always relied on WebMD to answer any quick questions I have about my health. Although it doesn't give you a diagnosis it gives you a good idea of could be wrong.,
"I rarely used the app, a basic Google search gave more relevant and in depth information.  Now I see that WebMD was paid close to $14-million of tax dollars to stump for Obamacare. Nevermore....deleting.",
The best medical app that I use in my public health practice for a couple of years now. A trial can convince anyone who installed it. What an app!,
The symptom checker works till you put about three things up and closes. Can't get any answers because you can't put in all your symptoms without it restarting. Downloaded this app before did the something still not fixed. I dont think I'm waist any more time trying it again.,
Every time I try to download  it it says it can't install on phone (s5) or SD card. Worked fine on my s3.,
I live in Canada n can NOT use this app because I do NOT have a US postal code waste of time!! Very disappointed,
"Love this app! It keeps me up to date with health information & also if we find a pill somewhere on the floor & don't know what it is, the app will allow us to identify the pill!",
But exercise CAUTION:  One should always consult a doctor prior to taking any website's advice and diagnosis.,
"Could not get drug info for many of my meds that i am prescribed. Most came back ""null"" sometimes the side effects & indications and /or other info came back the same. Weird. Not very useful when you don't trust the source.",
üëçüëç app its like a one stop shop it has so much  information. I use it for my whole family.,
Love this. There are times things happen to us in every day living. We all need this app. Emergency rises and you don't know this will help,
"Good app, but it would be nice if it doesn't require internet so I can access it off line.",
"This app has come a long way!!! I've had this app on every smartphone I have ever had & I must say that it is very impressive!!! The options are literally endless for the person who is curious about an ailment, as well as, an  attorney needing to do some quick research. Quick physician look-up with link to Google maps & very user friendly! Way to go!!!",
WebMD just took $13.7 million of our tax dollars to promote Obamacare. I will not use your website/app until you give the money back and promise to stay out of politics.,
It would be nice to have a home function so you can quickly go back to the body image screen,
"Every time I go to a doctor's office I see the magazine and I pick it up to learn something new. I love this magazine, and I will always love it.",
"Very very helpfull. I have learnt alot with respects to medical ailments, conditions, sympthoms, detections and what to do*",
This app put alot of hidden files in my phone I deleted app but couldn't delete the hidden files do not install,
I can not log in using my pin anymore. It didn't even try to log in using my pin. I also have to enter each pin one by one while pressing the next button.,
Keep the info coming.,
"I could not create an account without putting in an American zip code. Whilst I don't need info on where doctors and hospitals are in my area, it would be nice to know that this app catered for other countries too.",
Android version lacks the magazine. It is not useful to me.,
"Every since I updated,  nothing comes up on the description or anything. . Very disappointed. .",
"Love this app.  It helps me to decide if it it's urgent enough to seek medical attention right away, or if it can wait.",
I live in The Netherlands. Don't have an American area code needed to register. Bummer.,
I'm on several medications and I have seizures so this really helps me make sure nothing will trigger a seizure.,
No thanks - don't need an app where they get $14 million in funding from the government to promote Obamacare. They will self-censor info. No thanks.,
Disappointed as I love webmd but this app would not let me research things like high triglycerides and how to correct them.,
"My symptoms worsened after using this app. Very user-UNfriendly, does not respond accordingly and it will not even give a potential 'reason' for your symptoms.  Obviously the developer created this app whilst serving as an enema test subject and it's trying to share the pain.",
"Checked my son's ""symptoms"" on this app - who has strep throat - and one of the prognosis is the ""plague"" this app is for the simple minded and the hypochondriac",
It will not allow me to give myself a screen name it keeps saying it's offensive or has the the word staff or WebMD in it!,
It gets me as close as possible to me diagnosis!  Also gives me comfort for pain relief,
"So it's not bad but it needs more stuff. I feel like it's only very generic stuff like ""my back hurts"" and it gives some very basic reasons why it might. If this app had more stuff that might be more helpful.",
I think that it's a great tool to have to help you with keeping track of new & up to date information.,
I have used WEBMD for years. I have multiple medical problems. Many require several medications and I have always used my browser for WEBMD. Now I can use an app. Should make my life easier!!,
I've been spending years trying to out some information about a problem I have with my heart. Yet your app does not come any where close to me being able to learn more,
Very poor not easy to work it out or it mightn't be working at all its quite useless,
It's helpful. It gives you ideas about things you might not have considered.,
Very helpful for fragile souls like me... Must have for any smart phone...,
Drug side affects are not available on my cell phone.  It works fine I n my desk top. Don't bother for your Android.,
"My device does not have ONE! Please add a menu button option on the app so I may continue to use this app, otherwise it's useless to me.",
I type my symptoms and nothing comes up.,
Help me out when I have other questions on my health or more detail in depth.,
Sometimes it redirects me out of the mobile version if I need more info. It's a bit annoying,
"Such a great app to identify pills, get first aid information, and keep track of family medications and health history",
Need to get a better update on different symptoms. Ie. Low blood platelets,
Crashes upon opening on Galaxy S5.,
Hard to select specific areas with the symptom checker. The zoom in and out function is completly broken.,
A lot of missing data. Some of it just doesn't work. Still an immature app.,
This app is great To look up your symptoms.  Or just to look up general medical questions.,
Great for finding health information if you have questions about what is wrong with you.,
Very helpful! Much easier than using the Internet and I like how specific it gets when you input your symptoms.,
It won't let you save personalized drug information and doesn't always respond to your commands.,
most usefull in common disease knowlege n in G.P practice,
Nice app to upgrade u on medical aspects n terms also give u brief introdation n knowledge on diseases.,
Very useful for academic interest & provides awareness about health/various disorders.,
I like that you can research different types of illnesses and recommendations for a cure.,
If you pin point where your pain is it gives you several possibilities what could be wrong.,
Return results of cardiac issues for right shoulder muscle joint pain way off!!,
The Symptom Checker is awful and not helpful at all.  I was expecting it to be a bit more advanced.,
This app helped me find out what was wrong with me and me and my doc were able to come up with a great solution. Thank u web md,
"The search bar in Medicines section doesn't work. When you try to type, nothing comes.",
Play stores pop up and taking to unwanted apps to download. otherwise its good,
"Went right on site,put the symptoms I am experiencing and I feel I have diagnosed my problem. I was informed of my risk factors,which I am positive for every symptom. Will check with my MD. Thanks for being so accessible and informative!!",
Very good at identifying medical symptoms /conditions and actions for immediate medical emergencies care or treatment.,
"Due to difficulty on technical / clinical language, availability in other languages would be more interesting.",
My only complaints are that the file is large and it downloads some nasty pictures of some health problems.,
"I love this app.  It keeps me on point with my meds and illnesses, and surgeries and such",
No complaints... some folks just have to find something wrong with everything... this app is perfectly fine.,
"Good app to look up meds, symptoms etc.",
"Tingling on top of foot ,also lump on bend of knee",
"I like the app, but would like it as a one stop app. I can store my medicine, but would like to store my doctors.",
Need more descriptions or ability to type in symptoms.. because I couldn't find mine and the aren't strange or unusual symptoms!,
Uninstalling it right now. Privacy nightmare,
Web is all you need med ?s pill chkr symptom chkr ect.... And sooo easy and accurate u cant go wrong dwnld the app thnx buffie,
Uninstalled it. Giving me invalid zip code. I'm in Philippines so I guess this app is intended only for those living in the U.S. It is such a pity when I search online regarding certain diseases there's a link that would pop up and when you tried to check those you could not do so unless this app is downloaded. But this is not meant for people living in other countries.,
Im glad that this is available for cell phones. It will be very helpful in many ways. It is a must for all.,
"Very informative, helped me a lot. It's not just for phones,  I used it on my tablet.",
Typed in drug for description and overdose info and got nothing useless app,
I wanted this app hoping it would provide the diet tracking app that i could take anywhere without having to access the Internet.  Possibility?,
Good I really like this app because it has information about every thing...,
"Very frustrated. I'm a long time IOS  user of this app. Just started using an Android device. I can save items (medications, articles, etc.) when using my IOS devices but not when using Android.",
Very good app for all to use whether sick or a parent of asick child.,
"What good is this app, if it doesn't list basic prescription drugs I take.",
"However I have 3 autoimmune diseases, MS is 1. I was hoping to have a place to save all my medical things as well as symptoms and medicines for when I have to go to my many doctors. üòÜ I click on the area to do that and it directs me to go to Internet, I thought that's what this app was for so I don't have to go to Internet?????",
"It's very useful for me to live by maintaining my health, I have few diseases,  it's helping me to avoid dangerous conditions , the articles are useful for my studies also, am a pharmacy student,,,  thank u so much for the team behind the webmd,,,I was search a lot of articles, books, journals, before am getting webmd,now I got the webmd application also",
Love the symptom checker - not big on going to the doctors so this is a great app for deciphering mild to serious.,
It's great to have around as long as you don't put more into it but it.,
This app has alot of Medical Information that we needed!!,
Doesn't work on my galaxy s5 it just comes up with a black screen,
I'm not saying live your life by what this app says but it is a great place to start so you will know what to talk to the doctor about. They app is easy to use and works great!,
I like it.. but needs to have allergy list to medications and foods.,
"Nice to know what's going on in our body by symptom checker, atleast saves time to get an appointment with busiest doctor ; but still I respect DOCTORS first if next that is you..thank you.",
The one time I absolutely need to check it... the app refuses to open... I'm deleting and looking for something else!,
Stuff always popping up in my head in the middle of the night and this seems to always have an answer,
Absolutely exquisite. I couldn't be more happy. Thank you,
Like that u can search multipl e symptoms,
It freezes up my phone every time i  try to use it,
Web site forces you to down load this application stupid thing ever,
Won't do landscape making it less usable on tablets.,
Many times this app has helped me decide what to do about an illness or symptoms. Love it!,
Tried reinstalling.  Still a piece of crap that should be removed from the google playstore.,
There's no point to this. It's always inaccurate and so frustrating to use.,
"It didn't tell me anything I don't already know about myself and that's okay. Still has good information though.  I just wish the ""models"" had some form of ""clothing"".  I'm sure teenage boys love your app. Lol",
"I would rather be able to type in my symptoms, than scrolling through a list",
"Im so glad i got this app when I did. I thought i had a headache, but turns out i have a few diseases, and some parasites. Thank you WebMD",
This app would be 5 star if the family could be added.,
On new drugs .so I love having access to any possible drug interactions. Thank you,
Not good can't open keep saying app stopped.,
I have an lg optimus l90 and this app runs even and smooth with little to no lag times. If I could give 6 stars I would.,

. it is an ideal partner for a practical practitioner. A quick consulting point to any professional health worker. Also Good for medical  students.,

Layperson can use this app effectively and with confidence the material read will be easily accessed and understood.,
Used it for nursing school better than the expensive app my school wanted me to buy,
I've been visiting WebMD website for years so its great to be able to have the app.,
"When I feel sick or a family member does, I go to this app! Worth the download!",
I always go here to find symptoms and get suggestions.,
Web MD Is just what I need to find facts about difficult questions.,
I love it. Saves time and money on wasted trips to the Dr.,
"Every time I use web md to check my symptoms, and I'm dying.",
I find myself going to WebMD often!  Now having the app. makes my life a lot easier!,
It's always great to have a website like this to check out concerns,
"Takes too long, to scroll through symptoms, don't bother.",
It may been in the interest of illness to see your PHP and for go trying to diagnose ones self!,
This app is good for doing exactly what you can do on the website but drains your battery like crazy! Just use the website!!!,
You can believe in this app.  A great place to learn about your medical questions.,
Won't allow you to sign up_ requires a zip code but I'm in the UK & won't allow you to enter,
This is great!! Use it alot to look up all different symptoms,

It helped me figure out what was wrong with me.,

Does not give the option of storing these files on the SD card,
The heal2 and fitness tracker so we can update our foods water intake and fitness. Thanks.,

It's a good source for understanding medical conditions n treatments.,
I would like 2 keep a check on my asthma n depression n my back leg n seizures,
"It used to work on my HTC ONE (SPRINT). All of sudden I can't see side effects, uses,  etc.",
Hasn't been updated in almost a year.  If you're using Lollipop there will probably be issues.  Guess they are letting this app die a slow death.,
Downloaded app went through tutorial put in symptoms and still was unable to or did not come up anything to see what my condition may have been,
ALHUMDULILLAH... I learned so many things from this fabulous application...... Thank You WebMD,

"This is a great tool, but do not allow this to replace regular doctors' visits!",
"A useful, helpful and accurate medical app - certainly a must have.",
Really the most ridiculous app. when compared to the website. What were they thinking? Massive fail. Why? I want to just list my symptoms in a text entry search not tap body parts or select from a list. I couldn't even find the most basic obvious symptoms. Fail. Uninstalled.,
Very helpful to pin point what could be wrong,
Very helpful and insightful. Learned a lot in just my first usage.,
Ap takes an oddly automotive approach to health issues.,
I am experiencing multiple symptoms,
Love it. Ive used it on my Iphone. I never want to be with out it. Thanks for a great job!,
"Works great,  also keeps your medical and prescription information.",
Find out what pills are if u just find laying around so ur kids dont get over on you know before thay go !!!,
"With 3 kids, this app helps. I love it, its amazingly easy to use.",
Nice concept. But incredibly slow to load pages.,
Its very helpful and let me save a trip to the ER or got me to go get the care I needed.,
"The best app for medical information and info on meds, symptoms, the body, everything!!",
Rather basic in my opinion,
Suppose you have an emergency that requires a first aid treatment you don't know about,
The best they ever invented we all need to learn more about the medicine's we use!,
"Took too long to find a condition, they would have died....",
Too vague & not even close.  Can't do much in the application.  Wouldn't recommend it.,
I love this app but its missing disorders like OCD. :-/,
"With WebMD, there is none greater.",
You should say that you don't want anyone outside the US to use it....  Uninstalled.... Kind of crapy you don't want the rest of the world to use it,
I like it!  Its a fast way to look up medical info!!,
"Life & Death it is Not, or is it? It could be a LIFE LINE to your drug inter-action, should you see your doctor, or just Ignore  it all. Education is the operative  word.",

"Great for looking up symptoms, identifying pills, etc.",
It was really much better before updates . But I still love it!,
Uninstalled as refuses to accept my email address,
Didnt get around to install it as I must accept that they can access pretty much everyything on my phone. Why is that exactly??,
Would be nice to have a search option for symptom checker if you are shaky like your sugar has bottomed out or close to because how or where do you tap on the body for shakiness or low blood sugar?,
"App keeps uninstalling, other than that its very helpful",
Precise & informative.  Will make use of in the future as well.,

This app has so much info that is useful,
I love how accurate it is. I don't trust any other site like i trust web md.,
very useful to find the effects of medicines my family n i have.,

When I have a question this app gives me the answer.,
One could spend all day self diagnosing LOL,
The app lags and there's insufficient content.,
Nyc app sir ji. Keep it up and do more something for students.,
"Great, works good for me.",
We make parts that fly.,
This is a great app. If you have children this is a great way to get fast answers.,
Web MD is a great way to play doctor for yourself as well for family.,
Any time I have a question WebMD has an answer :),
I've put in all the symptoms to see what it could be and I'm thinking it's pregnancy and yet that's nit on the list of possible things it could be. Stupid!,
Great on the go app. I can look up anything at the moment.,
Been using this app for several years and it just keeps getting better.,

It doesn't let you save what condition you have,
I love this app it has a wealth of accurate  information  thank you .,
Love this app. Sometimes you have to search to find what you need but overall an OK app.,
Very hard to navigate.  Don't recommend,
This is a handy little app but whenever i go on here it seems like i always end up with cancer,
For study also great! Thanks for the web.,
Keeps me abreast of medical changes,
It has accurate and updated information that can be trusted.,
"It's just that, it's kinda fishy.. Why does this app has to have an access on my photos/medias? Or my phone calls?? Hmm..",
Comes in very handy when there is a medical question I want answered.,
Excellent application One can check doctors prescription need to upadate regularly,
Media files and phone access not cool. Location and Google profile OK. I love WebMd on the PC browser as access to files is none.....remove unneeded permissions and I will rate 5 and reinstall app.....,
Love this app. Learning so much on staying healthy,

"I came to try this app to use the symptom checker due to some gurgling in my lungs when i exhale. I tried the webMD app, I now know that I have bronchitis, pneumonia, cancer, GERD, bubonic plague, and I may be pregnant as well. I'm a 26yr old male so I'm not sure how that happened. But whatever. A hanger it is. Thank you WebMD for making the world a healthier better place.",
"I have always trusted webmd when I need to search something medical, but recently they give generic advice, nothing like it used to be. But still its conveniently at my finger tips. I really like that I can save anything I search/read in 1 easy folder. I like that I can look up some medications and illnesses, but not everything. The symptom checker usually just gives some scary results. I enjoy the reviews of other patients on medications.",
"It's great as far as it goes (e.g.  saving most, but not all conditions and medications), but it would be much better if you could save a list of your allergies and the doctors and hospitals that you use.  I can't imagine why these features are not included.   Also the lists of conditions and medications is far from comprehensive.   It would be great if those things were more comprehensive and you could save allergies & medical providers that you use.",
"It's a no brainer to create a program/algorithm accessible to all Dr.'s to make diagnosing and prevention a fool proof process, that yields expedited results, that save lives, time and money. Ultimately decreasing the chance of misdiagnoses & unnecessary drug use by patients, which simply crates more medical problems resulting in worsened conditions.",
I found this app at just the right time for the worst period of the most severe pain I've ever had. I have been diagnosed with a terminal illness and sometimes knowing what important enough to spend my own money on and what I already get free on.Disability and Special Needs to get meds for free.,
Does it's job seemingly.. however one must use with caution.. symptom suggestions tend to carry doomsday levels often which are usually untrue.  Creators might wanna look into that kind of potential panic creation. Stupid people do exist out there..  Example: Check cold symptoms or minor pains an find all sorts of things there.,
"It's a good app, I like that I can track meds and look everything up, however it would be more useful if you could add your dosage and if it's a current or past med. And same for the symptoms, or conditions, id love to be able to track those and add diagnoses dates and so on. Would just help so much.  Hope this is taken into consideration.",
"I know all my symptoms & conditions. I primarily use WebMD for the communities. Ironically that's the most difficult part of your site to find, especially on my phone.   Your app distracted me from my quest to reach the forums since it offers no access to them.  In essence, I have wasted the last 20 min of my life. Thanks so much for that. .",
It seems useful. I've looked up information on Web MD online for years for personal and business use. But the main reason I downloaded the app for Android was to help me locate new physicians for my children. When the Zip Code feature works properly I'll return a better rating.,
READ THE PERMISSIONS THIS APP IS REQUESTING!!!  way to intrusive it's creepy. This app waNts access to your microphone and states it can record your audio at ANYTIME without your consent. It also wants permission for your phone calls and can make calls without your consent. Why does it need access my exact GPS location and camera? No thanks I can do without the spying,
"I've noticed with multiple symptoms it just doesn't filter right. Conditions get added that obviously should not be based on symptoms the user adds. Certain symptoms will rule out a condition completely yet it is still listed. Considering none medical professionals really use this app I fell, it scares them thinking they have the worst case scenario. I hope with more updates you can't get better and more serious to maybe save some anxiety.",
"Especially for those that do not now how to track; maintain inventory and order needs. ..a good tracking tools, especially if you take many meds for various conditions; and some not for the treating entity everyday, so you know what to take and what you have taken everyday.  And keep those Dr apts.  You have to take care if youself; as few would help, even of you think they are your bests friends that say no.",
M very impressed with the content of dis app. So easy to understand for even a lay man.thnks a lot for such an informative app ever. I daily atleast read about one disease to increase my knowledge. Adding medication would complete dis app like no other. Hope to see dis change soon with future updates.,
"Please maintain your app, especially if you are going to pop up a JavaScript message every time I visit your site asking me to install it. Interface doesn't follow the Android design guidelines and it uses the dreaded legacy menu button. Images don't look good on higher resolution devices.",
"Personally i thought it was ok, but i always wait a week or two before reviewing anything. Anyway, downloaded it a week ago and its now messing up my phone. The app doesn't work at all and when i try and get it on, my phone crashes. Before i couldn't use it, it was a good app. Worthy of 4/5 stars. Im going to try reinstalling. =)",
"They have hardly any information AT ALL. For instance, there are NO conditions listed for an upset stomach, which is one of the most common symptoms in any sickness. How can you expect me to use this app if you tell me the numbness on my ribcage is from either a burn or a bruise when I have neither a) bruised it or b) burnt it? I don't know why people would give this 5 stars when it clearly doesn't deserve that. I was generous giving two. I love webMD but this is a poor excuse for an app.",
Search with ease =) and the medicine tracker is so helpful to keep track of what I'm taking and what can't be taken together. I am 29 and list everything over car accident and cancer and my brain/memory isn't that great anymore. Thanks WebMD,
"The makers of this app seem to believe there are no people outside of the USA. I'm in Canada, and the drugs quite often have different names, and the shapes/colors of pills could be different. The zip code is of no use here, and our drugstores are not part of any American chain, which means the app doesn't recognize them. All lives are valuable, not just American ones.",
"Does not adhere to Holo standards, let alone Material Design, will not work in landscape for tablets. It's 2015 now, let's acknowledge that Android has changed some in the past 3 years.",
Application easy to operate except for saving items other than conditions. Saving medical Rx needs to be better defined of execution (I.e. tapping mobile screen is NOT ALWAYS effective),
"I dnt do ratings n reviews but I personaly would like to say it is an extremely knowledgeable database that is well organized. Also, it is a great way to start recording changes and accidents to/within the body. It is a kool way learning ur body and medical information. Thanks and thumbs up for moe;)",
Doesn't cover enough conditions. I have had to uninstall and reinstall twice because it stopped working. Needs work. I may uninstall & give up. You people that gave 5 stars wait until you really have health issues then you will see how pathetic this app is.,
"Love this app, its like playing House,MD. Saved a trip so many times, cause i thaught it was much worse than it really was. And when my daughter had a really bad ear infection it helped me deal with it, before i could get her to the doctor. THANK YOU.",
"Wow do you realize I actually  impressed my physician, I had a meniscus tear in my left knee. I put in my symptoms and that's what it came out with, I had never heard of that until I put it to the test(Webmd)now I recommend this app to all my friends and family members, great job.",
"Why do developers ASSUME that everyone using an Android app is on a cell phone, I use a tablet!  This si a nice app but I will most likely delete it because it only works in Portrait mode, not landscape as well.  It is a royal pain to rotate my tablet, the cover/stand does not self support in portrait mode.",
The app constantly freezes and  glitches so I really can't do anything with it.  I downloaded because the real website suggested the app and wouldn't let me use the desktop version on my phone.  Guess I'll stick to WebMD on the computer only.,
Have been using WebMD for many many years on my computer&am very happy to have this app on my cellphone now. I have the GalaxyS3 with Verizon & have NEVER had any problems at all on a succession of computers&don't expect any on my S3. I am completely satisfied. Thanks for this QUALITY app! It's not something that occurs regularly!,
Don't appreciate that I have to download the app to use a Symptom Checker. I'm not sick that often so it's terribly inconvenient.,
"This app is a great tool to learn about your body and figure out why it works the way it does, possibly saving thousands of dollars in extra doctors visits because the app auto generates lists of possible conditions. The only thing I could ask for is a refreshed UI.",
This app doesn't load.  Gets stuck at 100% and freezes there.   On a cheap Kyocera Hydro worked fine.,
"As far as I can tell, while using my Android tablet,there is no way to save my information or symptoms.  This makes it necessary to re-enter EVERYTHING every time I log onto the site, making this app way too cumbersome to use & re-use.	0",
"Great tool to use for many reasons! I put my symptoms in and take it to the doctor with me to help me remember EVERYTHING, i know I'm not the only one out there that forgets stuff as soon as the doctor starts asking questions!! Lol it also helps give the doctor some ideas to learn on or at least rule out! I love thisapp!",
have this app on Galaxy s4 and after recent scan with malware bytes have found out it has permissions to record my calls...can't determine a reason the app would need this permission so uninstalling,
JUST DOWNLOADED THE APP. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BETTER THAN JUST GOING STRAIGHT TO WEB.ND. ON THE WEBSITE. BUT I COME INTO CONTACT WITH A LOT OF MEDICATIONS. SO I'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.,
"I just got this app today. I took it for a test run, and it works great! It gives you a tour(which is optional), and everything is very detailed. The best part is that if you're accident prone, and you don't have much space on your android, this app can go straight to a micro SD card! :)",
"Has made vividly clear alot of discomfort and worries. And assisted to double check diagnoises given me. Yes a 2nd opinion	Very handy",
So much better than going to the dr. You get so many answers. If u are uncomfortable talking to ur dr about somethings just use this app and it all stays private. I LOVE THIS APP,
I use WebMD on my Mac & this is a great way to have it all  at the tap of an app. No more lists for me‚ô•,
"I recommend this app very must especially for people with a medical condition as it can help you understand all this ""medical talk""",
"I just love this MD App! All you gotta do is give them your symptoms and they tell you what's wrong with you. Top that, they are basically 98% correct each time . The only bad thing is you still gotta get some medicine to cure the problem! The home remedies are pretty awesome themselves! Lol! :)",
"This app gives access to lots of medical information from meds to treatments. Symptom tracker can be confusing, but this can not take the place of your doctor anyway.",
I have used this program for 3 years to help with my rsd/crps it helped with medication and treatment and after haveing to rest my phone I regot the app today and I was very upset with the lack of information that was there. Now I may not be a doctor but in some areas I know more then some doctor do and the lack of information on medication and surgery's as well as conditions is insulting to the name webmd. If you need help adding things please let me know i'm disabled and looking for work.,
WebMD is an excellent resource. It simplifies all concepts I find difficult in any of my nursing textbooks. Thanks to the developers and contributors.,
My roommate introduced me to this app and it is serving me... It's detailed and I recommend this for medical or nursing students and staff. Thanks,
Pin function doesn't work. Some searches still miss the mark and I end up searching Google for an answer which usually includes a result for Web MD.,
"With having no insurance this app has helped me to really know when I can pretty much remedy myself (by going to Rite aid, Wal-Mart, etc) as opposed to worrying whether or not I need to head on down to the hospital and wait for 7 hours just for a doctor or PA to tell me what I could've found out here from my living room.  Great App!!",
"Put in my symptoms, clicked on possible cause, nothing would load. That's pretty much the only reason I downloaded this app.",
"Great app, but unfortunately the locator does not work in South Africa. :( Think the developers should put that in their own description of the program.",
Both WebMD and  WebMD Pain Coach(which helps you track your pain and symptoms as well as email it to your Dr's) are very helpful,
I love how you can be so specific and you can save symptoms that you want to. And thats just the beginning. There is so much info on this app I wouldnt trade it for anything no way.And I still have to play around with it and find out more about it. Great app you will love it. Downloading it is a no brainer.,
"I use it to help manage, heart disease and diabetes. Quick access to needed medical info.",
"I got the app thinking that for sure the local health forecast would be included in it. It would be so much simpler to use an app instead of the web site from my phone. I like what you do have in the app, but the one thing I wanted it for isn't there. Otherwise, you would get a better rating.",
"I cant choose the correct body part that is hurting. I continue trying to click on the wrist, but when I do hit the wrist, it pops up as arm every single time.",
"Does not work well for android tablet...cannot save to personal file, cannot add Cdn profile info, many features do not work",
"Have to login each time(not able to connect mostly), not very helpful when in doctor's office trying to give medical history.",
"This is my favorite medical app for checking symtoms, looking up conditions, and finding more info on medications. And believe me, I've tried lots of different ""symtom checker"" and ""pill ID"" apps to find out more about my own medical issues.",
"It would bye nice if you could also search for symptom .. Not just select from a list or by clicking on a body part.  Also zooming in and out on body is slow.  There are no highlights when selecting a body part from the  image, so it does not feel interactive.",
"Links constantly will not load takes forever to log in. Have to keep coming out of app and logging in to get anywhere. Then won't load pages (symptoms, articles, etc)",
It works great and it would get 5 stars if it would find my location do that I could look up local doctors like it said It's able to do. Fix that and I'll give it five stars.,
Already don't feel well... do having flashing advertisements on nearly every screen made me uninstall the app.,
But it still struggles to pull up the info in the symptom checker. After many tries I gave up,
This app allows me to use the program when I'm not at a computer and has come in handy quite a bit.,
There has never been a question I have not been able to get an answer to. And now to have a app for my phone is great.,
"I love having this app on my phone. The symptoms checker, conditions section & drug info section are most valuable.",
"I use this app, on the average, 4√ó weekly. I use it for recording my own health diagnosis & meds lists. Great for emergency info & updating doctors records. Also handy for looking up info for friends & family. Like the symptom checker,  all is great for reminders at next doctor appointments!!",
This app is helpful in managing your health. I have multiple chronic diseases. I can quickly and conveniently look up info on new meds and diagnosis. This app also assists me in tracking meds I am currently taking and side effects of past meds.,
I have a Galaxy 4. The app after putting in all your symptoms doesn't load. Un installing.,
Limited symptom checker just your basic afflictions so not all that helpful.,
I would absolutely recommend this app to anyone; both familiar and uneducated when it comes to the human body and the wonders it performs. Six stars,
"Definitely doesn't replace the doctor, but it s definitely a good way to tell if u need to see the doctor or if its a minor fix ;)",
"Worse than the website, if you can believe it. Do yourself a favor and see an actual doctor if you suspect you have a medical need. Using this app is like paying a visit to Dr. Nick from the Simpsons.",
"I think there should be more symptoms available, and maybe a more thorough description, but otherwise it's good",
"The webmd files are all outside in the root folder.put in a nice folder, tucked away. And clean these files once you update it. Otherwise it's an awesome app...",
"Look up your own symptoms before running to Dr.  This app is very informative and because of it I did go to Dr and good thing I did.   Big help, Worth DLing. 5 stars from me.  STAY HEALTHY!!",
"Symptom checker makes the world's worst guesses. No option for sudden onset vs. chronic, which smacks of developer laziness and ineptitude.",
"I came back from the Drs office and one of the conditions I have is Hypoxia. There is no where in Web MD can you find any condition related to hypoxia, and it's a very serious condition. Uninstalled immediately!",
"Could do with some element of, perhaps optional, offline features.  Also, it keeps on creating html files which aren't being placed in the dedicated app-specific folder and if moved there they'll end up being recreated!!",
"ESPECIALLY, when I need to know something about a potential problem that, either myself or, a friend might be facing.",
"'nuf said.  Actually, idi.have one thing to say. When I wad last at a doctor's office, the visiting intern referred to Web MD on her Android to check for interactions.   Nothing more need be said.",
Just needs to add more. doesn't seem to have all medications listed,
Won't load articles which is one of the main reasons I installed this app.,
Can't find my fitness log food log and won't allow me to enter my correct address and information,
I always find what I'm looking for. Very helpful anytime I look up things. One of my favorite apps,
"Super app., very helpful and since have this app.  used several times to find out what is the problem with the health or what is the best way to get healthy.",
"Needs either new colors or option to choose, when I log  in and go to ""my conditions"", the blue on green is impossible to read. 5 stars for fixing this.",
"I loaded WebMD thinking that it was like the full site on the net.  I wanted diet information, which I now know, is not part of the aps features.  Disappointed, just might uninstall.",
"I love that I can use the symptom checker from my phone. My only complaint is that it doesn't delete my symptoms after I exit - but that's not so bad... I haven't used the app much yet, but so far, I like it.",
"Does not work on my Droid Razr M. Specifically, symptom checker never gets past the possible condition screen.",
"Excellent and very informative app. Very convenient for us diabetics that want to have an immediate resource to information and how to  address concerns with our PCP. Just, EXCELLENT!",
Great information if only it would load up a bit faster. I've had to wait for it too often and too long. Using an N10.,
"Trying everything I can think of. I can log in on the website, but not through the app. Absolutely sure I am using the right credentials, just wont work. Excellent otherwise",
"Great app to get accurate information about conditions, drugs, and treatment. I use it all the time to self diagnose and ways to treat at home.",
"Please fix the problem regarding pages not loading. Entering the symptoms works fantastically, but when trying to open the conditions, the page never loads. Will up the rating once this issue is resolved.",
I've tried numerous times on my S3. I've tried on a friends S3 and it's not working. Conditions will not load. Please fix and I Will rate a five.,
Nice app. But I can't save anything. Wanted to save symptoms to show doc but I can't. Fix and will rate 5 stars.,
Won't even open. Keeps force closing and I have to go to the app store to attempt to open it. Icon won't show in my menu,
"This app does not list all the possible symptoms, so you can't get any kind of an accurate possible diagnoses.",
I would have given it five stars if it had Link's to the P.D. R. for example. Drew - NY. The colors for the saved things are illegible.  Blue on Green! Please change them.,
I will give 5 when i can put and  oz post/zip code in otherwise then that I've just started marking around with it,
I find myself needing to use the full site because the app library is so limited. This app is pretty useless if you have a smart phone and search the web.,
This app is very functional and user-friendly for anyone who wants to stay abreast of their health and/or medications.  Everything you need is here.  Thanks,
"Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but this app no longer works on my Nexus 4 updated to Android 4.4. One star until it's fixed.",
I like being able to have medical information at my fingertips. Not quite as informative as some of the others but still it's very handy!,
This app has been very helpful for many reasons for a couple disabled and having a hard time keeping up with all of the info we now need at several different times and places. Thank u for this one. LISA,
"Application will not open. When I try to open it, it goes to a black screen and I have to force close it. Nexus 4 running 4.4 KitKat",
"I'm a first time mother so I get really worried, really easy. Though the app saved me many trips to the hospital, I couldn't help but phone to make sure. Most cases the app was right.",
I was having a lot of headaches and multiple other problems the app told me to go to the emergency room immediately turns out   major surgery...,
"Very nice app for quick medical reference, but once I updated to Android 4.4 KitKat, the app freezes on the selection screen. I wish this will be fixed soon.",
I can't type in my app settings i live in Canada it asks for state and zip code.,
"I swear by WebMd. I diagnosed myself with appendasites a few years ago, it was taken out 24hrs later.",
"Truly loving the fact, I can click on the parts of the body with the symptoms and finding out the results within seconds.",
"This app US just too good, I loved the site, but this app takes health issues to a whole new level...",
I sign in it tells me my account doesn't exist. I go to make an account and when I hit submit then nothing happens. Tired of playing with it. Going to uninstall and wait for the next version.,
"Loads of information quickly. Great for reference. UI needs to be updated to fit Android though, currently to much like an iPhone.",
I like this because it is a quicker and easier way than going through the browser. I will give 5 stars if the Health Weather Forecast is added to the app.,
I tried signing up the 1st time and messed up now it won't let me try again,
"It's alright. It gives you options and it works well, but its inaccurate",
"Some pages work while others are continuously stuck in a ""loading"" state.",
"Gives you insight on some major issues, but other stuff is greatly missing. Don't include both arms or legs, etc.lacks a lot.",
"Very confusing to use, I choose my body section but its nowhere near to Helping me get my answer.",
"This app is fast, easy to use and has provided me lots of information about medical conditions, medication etc.  Athough adverts are annoying.    I would definately recommend this app.",
There should be an area for allergies. That way I have a list and don't have to look at my beat up medi bracelet,
"the last 5-6 years. And at times, have even compared the information with a Pharmacist and I have always been more than satisfied with this site.",
The pill id part did not work. I entered in all information asked but it never id the pill,
Love this app I find it very useful and reassuring when my kids aren't feeling well it helps me better understand the symptoms. Great app thanks web Md app,
"Can't say more about it for now. It has to be for normal users, not for professionals.",
"The new symptom checker is terrible. The old one was much better. None of 
the article text shows up. I can't select a body part or different types of 
pain. I can't add whether it was from injury or not.",
Just wish it showed more information like the full site does.,
So slow. Constantly loading while using wi‚Äìfi. Yes the connection is fine.,
I learn so much from a non doctor perspective. I care to live a long life. So I do it by educating myself about staying healthy and alert others from this site.,
Just downloaded it can't wait to use it thanks,
It helps get an idea on things. But everything I read says to please advise yr doctor and listen to their dosages. But it still gives u an idea if what might be wrong and such.,
"So informational, just wish when you use the symptoms checker it would narrow the options a little more. ;)",
"Webmd has always been my go to source for medical information, so pleased to have this app.",
Downloaded this application went into it and I can't use it can't find your location glad I didn't pay for this application wouldn't reccomend it,
This app continually opens the play store without prompting. Very hard to use when continually diverted to the play store to download a game.,
"My Doctor told me about this site, in college I had wanted to go into sports medicine.",
"Never use this app as a definite answer source. It is supposed to be used with your doctor's medical advice. When it is being used for that, it is great.",
Stupid app. Broken foot. New pain meds. Vomiting. Wont even give answer. Took all my personal info to tell me nothing. Back to the emergancy room.,
This app can help any family quickly in a crisis.,
"Just downloaded this  app, but have heard nothing but good responses. Will rate later.",
"Seems to be made for U.S. users, leaving others out. App is clunky and doesn't use native dialogs.",
I love how this thing tells you what you need to know and helps me with my medical problems.,
You need to add a question that asks if you've had certain body parts removed. Like I can't have tonsillitis because I don't have my tonsils anymore.,
Webmd need to create a part for the weight loss program on their site.,
"I use webmd for all health concerns; food, medicine, pain or just general knowledge.  I love the site. This symptom checker helps my whole family. Especially me...the hypochondriac!",
"A neat app with symptoms checker, disease conditions and articles regarding the disease. Very useful in daily practice.",
"I really love this app! It's been extremely helpful, except for the few diagnosis's its missing, that I ended up being diagnosed with. I suggested that they add symtoms and diagnosis they dont aleeady have to perfect the app.",
"this is the best thing since grit, thanks WEBMD so much",
this app is so tedious to use. finding your symptoms can take forever because there is no search function.,
App is everything I expect and need in a medical application. I rated a four because I prefer an adult free version. I am willing to pay for a premium version with no ads.,
Non stop crashes on the nexus 5. Can't get past the home screen,
"Awesome app, has everything you need to know about medication and symptoms involving medication. Also helps diagnose condition that could prevent an expensive trip to the Dr.",
"It erased what I had entered and I had to do it all over, but it helps me determine if I'm serious enough to see a doctor or if I can just wait it out. Good easy to use app.",
Is *crap*. Just go see your doctor. They have so SO much more experience.,
You are better off going to the website.,
Lots of good info but still limited. Hard to search for a symptom such as a rash.,
"As a diabetic, I love  how I can get diet specific recipes to meet my needs. Delicious too!",
"Love this app, especially when trying to narrow down possibilities of symptoms. Love how you have easy access to answers too.",
Store prescription information and filling out the forms for doctors and hospitals is a piece of cake. Easier then trying to update lists before I need them. Great program highly recommended.,
"I understand the need to generate income through advertising,  and when ad is distracting and blinking and annoying,  then I dont really need the app.",
I have had this app for a long time. It's worth it I loads of good.information. You got something wrong? Just type in the symptoms and it'll tell you what's wrong. Or at least darn close. It will let you know  when you should go to the doctor.,
Very very informative. Could diagnose far better than money minded health proffesionals.,
Can't open app at all. Message says medmd has stopped working & then closes out.,
"Only problem is, it could be easier to pinpoint the problem area instead of just the usual spots",
Love it. It realty helps me don't like going to the doc so I do this in stead an self medication,
Please fix the background on the saved conditions. Its not readable. Thank you.,
"I can sign in from the Web page, and i can enter my username and parties in the mobile app but nothing happens when i press the sign in link button. Link appears to bee broken but there's no error or response whatsoever.",
I have found answers to at least 95% of medical questions I've had and i definitely have plenty of questions due to having an extremely bad type of MS that keeps me wondering,
30 yrs old and had my first experience with poison ivy. Without this app i could have spent alot of money going to the doctor,
"I have uninstalled & reinstalled this app and I still can't log in to my account. There is no option to log in after putting in my email and password on the sign in screen. The only options available are ""forgot password"" and ""sign up"". When this is fixed, I will amend my rating.",
Lets me have a little piece if mind when not feeling 100% without talking to a machine or being put on hold!,
"No other app is as easy, detailed, and gives you great answers.",
"Has the most accurate information about your help. I love it. Anything i need to know about my body that I have questions about, I can count on Web MD",
"I am very happy that this app was available. It is very easy, helpful and very informative. Thumps up",
This app gives me an idea of how should i handle whatever problem or pain i might be having. this app is great,
"I am trying to find information on the throat, and it only has info on the neck. When you go to neck it doesn't deal with the inside of the throat. I think this app really leaves a lot to be desired!",
Webmed is the greatest creation on earth. I would love to have more access without internet connection but its still great!,
Really helps and if I'm worried I attend a doctor's appointment xx,
"Great information but alot of the pages are labeled with green and blue which makes it almost unreadable to me. White and  black are classic for a reason,  it's readable.",
Not like regular version on the computer. I wanted to look up vitamin K2 and no where to ask!!,
Entered all my personal information and now I can't read it.,
"Really helpful and easy to use, also gives lots of resources for you and what steps you should begin first. Lots of help!!",
Great app. I am always having questions and this app really helps narrow down the possibilitys of what could be wrong.,
Check here for peace or see what drugs you have been supplied by g.p,
It doesn't accept post codes for Australia & other countries mentioned already. But bigger issue for me is obviously Australian medications not found. However for use in general ie. symptom checker its ok.,
It isn't a total coverage of the human body and it's ailments... But it is a good start. An eclectic assortment of sicknesses. The symptom checker Rocks!,
It doesn't give a possible condition for all symptoms. It just gives it for each one.,
"I'm dumping this app because I just found out they received millions of dollars to promote the ACA (Obamacare). The ACA is bad medicine and if WebMD is going to promote it, then they can't be trusted with anything concerning my health.",
Tapping the +/- is pretty hit or miss and overall accuracy on where I tap the body seems to be extremely inconsistent. Other than that when it works it works as well as the website.  I think I'll stick with the website.,
"Pinpoints things much better then other health apps, love it glad they have it",
"I have used this app for years.   Both as a user in the medical field, and for use at home. Glad to be able to download it to my new phone. The Galaxy S4.  Keep up the great work!",
"I am annoyed with the fact that at completely random moments, I will be taken to the google play store to download a whole bunch of random apps. This is very awkward, but otherwise, good app.",
"easy to use, informative, & is a sure way to make you feel like youre going to die! lol overall great app! Worth the download.",
"From 11 to 39, all a woman can get is pregnant. At 40, Death Panel.",
Good information but useless outside of the US.  Will not accept Canadian address.,
For instant updates on New medication. Or four those people who really need the assurance of great advice.,
"I have a ZTE Warp model N60. I downloaded the app, But all it does is keep loading and reloading. It won't open the application besides that.",
Great app.,
"Package invalid,  unable to install this app.",
Helps detect sicknesses easily  but of course not to depend on and give full hope.  Sometimes you'll be mistaken with other things,
Not compatible with a tablet. If this changes then so will my rating.,
Just wish that the apps that are so useful actually I'd like to see the apps utilize the memory card instead of jamming the phone up causing the issue of limitations for the apps wanted for use.,
Some places are not available. Not a vslid zip code whatever,
"Can't trust an app that installs unrelated, unwanted software! Either WebMD is aware or they have been hijacked.",
Just don't try to self diagnose lol its kool to look stuff up and learn about things,
"Wow, after installed it literally took 5 minutes to load and I got tired of waiting, and I was using wifi do I don't know what the delay is.",
Web MD has helped with alot of questions I've had about some of my conditions Its absolutely very helpful! I recommend it to all my friends and family and to anyone who wants to learn more. All in all I LOVE it!!!,
This app doesnt give you a good range of symptoms to choose if its something uniquely specific. It needs to be smarter and give a more detailed analysis. Dont waste your data on it!!!,
I gv 4 stars. . . I hope this can be used without net and wifi connections. . Much better,
"But I hit my little toe on a table...Thyroid cancer, thanks webmd",
I am over it. All i wanted to do is check the flu thing out and the loading bar keeps going and going.,
"Good News is, I missed it and came back!",
Installed fine. Won't load. Won't work. Waste of my time. Would give it zero stars if possible.,
Would be better if it did not leave so many files behind after you use it.,
"Love the fact that you can look up anything.  I.e. medical terminology,  symptoms,  medicines.  Good app.",
A 24/7 app that helps you diagnose many things that can be making you sick. A doctors care is only 100% vs Med MD app.,
"It seriously is a good app, infact its a must, I being a doctor recommend it to everyone of you, guys don't forget to rate this app, it's better than those stupid games and good for nothing softwares, it can very well save somebody's life in your family or around..",
"Side effect of med I am taking is NOT listed in phone ap,  but is listed on WebMD website.  Therefore cannot depend on phone ap 100% of the time.",
"I have no use for this app since there is no way to increase the font size of provided textual information.  I have less then perfect eyesight, so for me, this app is worthless.",
This is a great app to have for emergencies and for dr visits that leave you a bit confused.  Works great on my ZTE.,
"Great for quick answers to medical care  Signs and symptoms of everything that can be typed in, testing and a point of reference to call your doctor",
I hope nobody thinks they're dying because of the app though. :p,
"Symptom checker conditions don't load properly on Galaxy S4, Im able to add the symptoms fine but as soon as I select any condition it just gets stuck at the loading screen.",
I wish I could rate this app 10 stars!!! WebMD is the only app I trust when it comes to finding the answers to mine & my family's health concerns. Thank you so much!!!,
Can't create an acct tries to tell me my email is not valid even tho I get TWO newsletters at said email,
Too tired to write review... Just take my word for it.,
"I love this app, didn't know I could get it on my phone. Awesome!",
Every 2 mins it opens the app store advertising some stupid game. Very unprofessional webmd!,
Seems like they should ask me questions so they can give a more specific diagnosis.  You might have one of these 20 things is not terribly useful,
Love this app! Always handy when i need it. Doesn't always find the generic meds but still very great!,
Have always loved WebMD and rely on it constantly. But using the app on my tablet is a nuisance. How about screen rotation to adjust the legibility? It's a pain to enlarge every screen and then swipe side to side to actually read it,
this app can do so many things I cannot believe !It it is so worth it!  :-),
This app is great! Works just as it should on my LG Optimus L9. Would be nice to read consumer medication reviews. Feedback email doesn't work. Pls fix.,
Loving this app it is sooooo informant whoever came up with it a thousand thanks to u,
So you can tell your Doctor why you are there to see Him/Her save a copay Isay,
Good solid information which is what you come to expect. Interestingly there is no information on diet or nutrition. No access to articles on their website. The cheesy ads do nothing but detract from their credibility.,
This actually can save people I've seen it happen,
"If you need regular terms for diseases, this app is the one!",
"I love the app, but it tends to lock up quite often",
"This is really a Great App!!! Been waiting for sumthing like this to cum, thanx Web MD uv outdone urselves",
"If all the contents are accessible offline, like the medscape apps. Then it will be great.",
It would be really useful apications for pharma field and medical field as well..great.,
I think it's awesome that you have an app so I don't have to look at the big web page,
I had this app before and loved it but it's taking forever to download now.,
Doesn't follow many Android UI guidelines but pretty good overall.,
This app has the best medical info you can get and Medscape too.,
Shows the loafing circle and nothing loads after waiting for several minutes!,
Live in Puerto Rico and I am unable to enter my address.  The application doesnt sync all the info entered on the website and does not integrate with Webmd Pain Coach,
Thank you so much for providing this app.. A must have for every android user.,
This app had been helpful in numerous ways.  Our family constantly uses it.  Thank You.,
"I use the site all the time, it's the only site I trust for medical disclosures.",
"I love this webmd app and the quick easy access to medical info! Not to mention its free, safe and reliable!",
I install it use it. I'll not use it then it say app not installed. Fix that please.,
Checked symtoms went to doctors and 97% of the time it was accurate,
"The symptom checker leads to conditions anyone can figure out by common sense. And the condition Sunday hands and never produces information, just a swirling ""loading"" icon.",
"I of the best medical app,it tells all the information about any disease",
So stupid i just wasted my data downloading this.,
Makes sense of many different symptoms. Good knowledge base.,
Do not only use web md for drug information some are incorrect use other sources to verify information such as Nurses drug handbook!,
"Finalist in 2011 Moble App Showdown out of over 100.apps,.held at CES Las Vegas Nv. This app is like having  a Nurse at your beck and first aid manual in your pocket. Don't leave home without it!!",
Use it a lot to look up simple stuff or what the Dr has all ready confirmed. Good for everything.,
I have four android devices.  This app is only compatible with two.,
It pretty much told me exactly what was wrong by using the symptom checker,
Sometimes it's nice to have some information before I decide to take my kids in our not severe enough. Easy easy easy to use!,
"Pretty good app,helps alot when you have health problems,check it out",

"Information regarding the conditions selected does not load. If that can be fixed for me, I'd rate the app at 5 stars.",
Web MD is under contract to promote (push) Obamacare.,

Wow great UI and information presentation.,
Good app except it keeps   saying I'm dying,
Love this app. It gives important information and insight on how to manage the symptoms.,
I use symptom checker all the time.,

Great app just like the website did not find much info on treatments but otherwise very good,
Will not accept Canadian postal code when trying to sign up.,
"99% of the time I go on a computer to WebMD I do a SEARCH. Symptom Checker is comprehensive, but results are overwhelming--it's like an episode of House, MD where they're just shouting out possibilities.",
Swear to god I have cancer.,
"Force closed on very first attempt to use and could not get it to open. Just a white screen, then a force close...thanks for wasting 9.48MB of my data!!!",
It is good when you are sick and good for looking for a doctor and many more I  give it a five star,

"I find it useful, its convenient for hypochondriacs like myself or just to see what's possibly making you feel like crap today. I would defiantly 5 star but I can't understand why they don't have a ""pregnant"" option for the female gender selection,  my gf is 20 weeks and I would like to be able to check stuff for her as well. Please consider this :)",
"This app surprisingly uses the root of the SD card to cache HTML files that don't get cleaned up with uninstall. Considering that these are likely articles you've been browsing, and that the root directory is simply an inappropriate place for any app to use to cache data not intended for other apps to access, I recommend avoiding this app until this is fixed.",
"All of my prescriptions at my fingertips. Handy when seeing a doctor and you are asked what meds are you taking. Another advantage is uses and side effects of medications. The only request I would make is to build in an alert to warn you if any medications listed on your WebMD app you take might have an adverse or dangerous effect by mixing any drugs you are taking. Regardless, I have no reservations giving this app 5 stars!",
"A great and informative app. It is very USA/Canadian orientated. shame seeming it gets 99% of its information from the web.  When I inquired about hospitals, pharmacy near by it came back with ZERO results, there is a pharmacy next door to me ! The rest of the app is OK but its not UK friendly.",
"Search function works well, option of saving the meds you take and various searches, articles etc are easy and readily accessable for future references. IMHO this is a excellent app and serves as a handy info file thats always on hand when visiting the Doc for your meds and notes are on the phone at a whim.",
"I love this app. Always useful and gives you total peace of mind when kids are sick. Tells you how to care, what to watch for, and when to take them in. Plus you can save information so you always have access to it when you cant access to internet. Would be nice if they expanded their system of condition/diseases.",
"Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Went into settings and attempted to complete the form. I input all of the information and tried to get out. I got an error msg saying ""incorrect data"". It did not say or show what was wrong. I checked everything and it was all correct. The only way out of the form was to remove the battery. Not much good. Uninstalled.",
"This app is very user friendly,  I like the symptom checker, although rash isn't listed in symptoms. I just found out I had a first aid list downloaded in my phone files. No problem with that, but wish I had known.  I ise web md a lot on internet so am really glad they have this app.",
"After being forced out of my job and losing my health insurance, I began developing an irritating rash that covered the entirety of the surface of my body. I installed this app and the rash went away. Since then, my blood pressure has normalized, my cholesterol levels have dropped, and I've begun noticing other health improvements as well, such as super-human speed and the ability to read minds. Recommend to anyone who's life has been ravaged by chronic infections and disease.",
I installed this app to figure out what was wrong with me because I was feeling too cruddy to get up to the computer. I tried opening the app almost a dozen times with an error message before it even opened. I had to end up hobbling to the computer.,
Wish they would spend a little more time making more android apps. I found some for the outdated I phone but only this app for the more popular smart phones. Most people I know have given the iPhone to their kids as a toy.,
I had an iphone for years and used webmd app a lot at work (im a nurse). Android version doesnt give all the info that the  apple version does such as whether or not to take a medication with food or specific amts of fluid. Very dissapointed in android version,
"I'm giving this a 3 as that's an adverage rating, and dispute all the hype this is only an adverage app for VERY common illnesses. Case in point a friend has MRSA, which isn't exactly an exotic disease such as Ebola, yet I got ""no results found"". Seriously? 8% of all infections are nosoconial infections, over 2 BILLION worldwide carry the S. Aureus bacterium and 2.7% of them (53 MILLION) it's MRSA but ""no results found""? 99,000 people died of MRSA in America alone in 2002, and it's only gotten more common.",
I don't like this format.   I would like a search area where I could enter a key word.   I used to like Webmd a lot.   ... And now I can't even submit  my review :-[   So now I just gave up trying to submit my review.  I pressed my back - screen button and the keyboard disappeared and I can now submit.  Why is it so difficult,
"It has inapproiate password constraints. For this reason, I was unable to use my selected medical password.  Based on this design defect, I elected not to create a user account.",
Incomplete database doesn't have every medication listings I answer information from a pill bottle I have in hand and it still doesn't work does not find the pill on looking for,
This app is amazing and has been a great source of medical information for me. It's so amazing that one of the probable conditions according to my symptoms scared me so much that I held off on visiting my doctor for a few months. That was dumb on my part though.,
Site is easy to follow with so much information. Have passed this web md on to many friends .thanks,
Simply superb  Great solutions Detailed descriptions Knowlegeable At comfort of our houses,
I just got lost for 30 minutes reading one short article after another. Makes me feel just as informed as any doctor.,
"Doesn't even get past the splash screen before an error message pops up. Never finishes opening, just closes. UNINSTALLED.",
Failed to upload necessary content to use this application. Uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times,
"All information has been on point and very helpful. Love that is does not need internet connection to work, in case of emergencies. I say for the galaxy s this app gets 4 stars.",
"Used on my note 2 phone & tab 3 8 tablet..searches bring "" no results"" or it takes forever to get a result. Looking for another Med resource. So sorry.. Webmd...your android option leaves alot to be desired.",
Possible causes not even close. Look up uti symtoms medmds answer was possibly broken should blade.... Nice,
"Continually asks for zip code when signing up, but I live in an area with none, does not ask for country. Needs to be user friendly for non Americans. Otherwise good app.",
All this app does is force close. It will not open at all. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling which did nothing. Uninstalling for good this time. HTC Droid Incredible,
Has great information on health problems. Haven't had any problems so far.,
So glad to have this app handy especially when your doctor's got the day off or too far away from the doctor's office. Its like having a doctor or nurse as a relative! Great info! Highly recommend it as a mom of two little ones.,
"Simply great material for the layman and a good refresher for the professional alike; and it is FREE! It doesn't get any better than that! Highly well developed and recommended app; well done folks, WELL DONE.",
"I liked it. The description of drugs and conditions are quite simple and easy to understand. Very handy. The only little concern is that, the name of drugs are not so updated. Otherwise it could be an excellent.",
Very nice app. I was disappointed that generic drugs were not covered in more detail. A lot of people use them because of the low cost.,
Usefull and easy to understand the meaning.when we conducted our case press I was able to find the answer here.so thank you,
Wouldn't get pass the opening screen (would load anything) terrible app.,
Website is easier to use. This app is a nice idea but not as easy to find stuff. The categories aren't as intuitive. I don't want to have to think that hard if I'm already sick.,
"This app contains just about everything you need to know about diseases, treatment of diseases, and symptoms. You can also use this app to search on the WebMD web site. It just full of information.",
Might help in emergency conditions. Contains large amount of knowledge. The best part is it that it is offline and would be useful in emergency conditions where data is not available.,
It really is a good idea but it dosen't work. Uninstalled.,
"This would be a good app. except it doesn't recognize that I  live outside of the US which makes it useless to me,so when you fix it will be good.",
I have a kyocera echo and this app sounds wonderful but it will not open on my phone! Please fix. This app seems helpful thank you,
Would be good to have a setting for UK like the website does.  Wasn't able to do sign up on this because I have to put in a zip. We have post codes with letters+numbers and not physically able to change to keyboard as the mock dialer pops onscreen and doesn't allow it a change.,
The app does not have the fitness planner... It would be great to have this in my phone,
Very informative with detailed info and alot of sicknesses to choose. Every one needs an app like this.,
"This app is absolutely great. This is the best app, to use , it has been a great asset to have available. Thank you to the whom ever made this.",
Love how easy it is to search and view a wealth of information about health. Symptom checker is a great first resource before seeing a doctor. Lovely app.,
Well this was completely no help because it doesn't give an option to put pregnancy as a symptom.,
It's pretty much pointless if you live anywhere that isn't the US or Canada because you can't sign up without a zip code,
Installed and the application will not run. Every time I try to open the application it has to be force closed before it even runs. I use WedMD online and love it please fix,
I think it is just great for when you can't get to the Dr. right away. Thank you web Md,
Useful but then it slowed my phone to a crawling standstill by sucking up every drop of available memory.,
Excellent app with one minor error. It is compatible with TF300 but Google Play will not allow download.,
Has already named and displayed problems that I have been suffering for years,
"No matter what I need from this app, it has it! The wife and I have this app on both our phones. It helps with our 3 children as well.",
As good as the original site. Lots of ways to personalize and save your favorites. Best app of its kind,
It's great to have so you can look up all of your medical needs! It is up to date on all of the medical information out there!,
"HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL,ILL USE THIS APP FOR ALL MY ISSUES.",
Amazing with today's technology can offer us,
"I use it when doctors advice for any medicine or suddenly if anyone or even me feels sick then I open it from my Galaxy Grand,I follow the symptom and advice for medicine.",
"It gives you to many possabitilies of what something can be, which really makes you worry. Other then that it is great!!!",
"Want most accurate about health issues, here it is! Android razar maxx.  Kare-Bear Hodge",
You can save the meds you take and lookup symptoms and treatment. A very useful app for lots of information. Everyone should have this app!,
I love this app. It's a great app. I have two kids so its very very very convenient. I give it 5 stars.,
I love being able to look up possible causes for aches and pains!,
Need to work out contact links which do not function correctly.,
"I can't add contacts. It would be good to be able to document the dosage as as the medication on my list. Also it would be good to have multiple users. Such as wife, mom and kids. Overall I like it but needs some improvements.",
"Doesn't even open! Please please fix this, Web MD is a great application.",
It is very irritating that you can't just search your symptoms and you have to look at the syptom list or pick a body part. How am I supposed to know which body part has fatigue listed on it?,
"This application is almost like having a doctor in your pocket ready at any time to answer your questions as needed. But, don't be misconstrued into thinking this takes the place of a real doctor, especially in an emergency!",
I have the babymd app which i LOVE so i installed this one and it will not load unintalled,
I use this app whenever I or a grandchild has something I am unsure of and it is helpful in that I do not need to run to the doctor for small issues.,
"General search window feature at the top of app is missing for android, which is available for iPhone.please provide it.",
It won't open at all it just says there is an error and then force closes. Uninstalling.,
I love this app it helps alot it save you money and time to see a doc for minor sickness,
"I really do. I never leave comments, But when I tested this Apps abilities  I was so impressed I felt in desperate need  to leave a comment and let  you guys know  God Bless Thee Makers of This App!",
I love this app! I found out I have cancer and I got so many prescriptions that I forget what they do. The drug glossary fixes that. I love it,
"I was looking for an app that I could enter my all of health information into and just forward it to my doctors. I have recently moved and have had to start over with all new doctors. It would be so convenient to have an app to save all of your doctors' information, personal health info, diagnoses, and Rx; that way when u meet with a new doc u can just email your info to him. I gave this app 2 stars bc all of the info on your webpage should also be on this app. A lot of info is missing. Fix it!!",
Won't even let me look up acid reflux,
"I is a good app. Would like to save doctors, Pharmacy,  and hospital info.",
I use it a lot...Since I take a good many prescriptions. This app helps a lot. I always use this app when my doctor gives me a new script. I also have checked out the other uses of this app!  Great app!!,
"For serious inquiries of knowledge. Member since 2000. Others...medscape, etc",
Love this app great to look up meds or something you want to know about illness,
On my droid x it worked. On my incredible force closes before it can load,
Two wishes. More extensive ability to record medical history and vitamin and suppliment information.,
Wont work on epic 4 g,
User friendly and thorough list of diagnoses snd medications. Thank you!,
This is great app for me since I'm in medical school. I love this app.,
Now won't open at all,
"Can't open. Uninstalled, redownloaded, still error message when i try to launch. Plz fix :(",
"when I was super sick all the drs I saw told me they couldnt find what was wrong with me, when I put my symptoms in the checker it came out hyperthyroidism and sure enough when I requested the tests it was my thyroid. id refer it to anyone",
Most of the time app wont open very disappointed .,
I'm from Canada I have a postal code not zip code.....please accommodate.,
I've always loved this app. Love it on my P.C and now on my tablet.,
See the website app has problems logging in.,
"I love when I think I have a cold, but I really have cancer!!!",
On the symptom checker its says everythings the left sole..,
Detailed description on all subjects related to your body,
"I'm so impressed. Great app! Who needs a doctor, when you can do it yourself.",
I love this app it helps me stay up to date on my med info,
On screen advertisement is ruining this application.,
It's invaluable having quick access to first aid info,
I adore WebMD! Hooray for app form!,
Wish it would just work in browser. Didn't really need an app,
Force closes every time i open it.,
This is a great app but what about the people that live in different parts of the world such as the UK? Please make it available where you can choose your own country when they want to sign up,
"I love the website soi searched for the app but it won't open... I uninstalled and reinstalled it three times, but I still have the same result...",
Doesn't describe my symptoms.,
I waited over 10 minutes watching a down load bar.. not sure what was down loading... VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!  Uninstalling..,
I like it very much.,
Doesn't work on HTC Vivid,
Very good layout and list of symptoms,
Great and easy to use for quick results,
i think its a good approch for maintaing your health.,
Very usefull aplication i am using des,
Doesn't load. Makes me force close. Can't even open it.,
"The best app ever, 5 star forever",
Best health/medical app ever,
A must have for second opinion and piece of mind,
Perfectly organised app for medical students,
just wonderful.Nothing more to say.Every one must have this.,
I'm just getting started. No problem so far. Very helpful.,
"Nice app, help on hand",
Need to have options to post questions.,
"Will not connect to the internet on my rezound, uninstalled!",
It's WebMD,
Very Gd and give u what u what to no about u medical,
Comes in handy when I need it.,
Thanks for your nice and help full app.,
I like the website but the app isnt responding to find a hospital. This sucks.,
Love looking up my medicine,
This is great but DOKNOTES is even better,
Won't even open past the loading page.  Just keeps loading and loading.  Uninstalling,
Quick. Convenient. Easy and spot on. LOVE IT!,
"Fantastic point of reference, gives me an idea when I need to visit the doctor and don't :-)...but why do you need permission to make calls from my phone? Will not update while this is STILL required.",
App does what it says but search terms and articles are limited.,
"I have reinstalled twice and as soon as I tap to open it, I have to force close.",
Don't count using app to find your hospital...use the yellow pages,
"Doesn't load!!!!! Waste of space, POS!!!",
I love this apk,
It is very crucial,
need i say more,
"This is the best app, I love it",
Nice handy and useful app,
Overall great app for mobile.,
"U can learn from it,too. Interesting!! Good work, developers...",
Very nice app,
"Excellent App, very useful",
Doesn't even open,
A very nice app.. must download app...,
Nuff said. Thank you.,

"For one I can't view all images it saus are available for drugs. Second, it doesn't have regular adult depression listed as a condition. Third, I'm on the pill form of clonazepam, but all that's listed is clonazepam oral which appears to be liquid in the image it shows. However, I think this app is helpful and on its way to being great if bugs are fixex.",
"Refuses to update. Downloads and then says something about not being able to install on external USB or sdcard. So has move to sdcard function, but no updating once that's done. Motorola Bravo MB520  Update: well, still no update or addressing this issue. If I can't update, it gets outdated. If outdated it gets uninstalled. That simple.",
"Steamed like a really gd app and just wot I was after but to save anything I had to create an account, not a problem until I had to enter a 'zip' code & in Australia we don't have 'zip' codes therefore I am unable to save anything. Very disappointed. Wld have given 5 stars. Plz fix & I wld recommend to all.",
"I love this app. Comming from the field and working in a clinic now, its much easier to confirm my logic or dispute another logic for our patients. My leiutenit has been more than impressed. If only the drugs were broken up and divided by what they are used for id give this app a 6/5 nice job and good on you the developers",
"As a CPhT, this is a useful tool to have on hand, both for work and my personal life. One thing I've found so far that could increase it's usefulness is to list the mg/kg/day for drugs, especially in drugs for children. Unless it's already there and I haven't found it yet! Thanks for a great app",
"I am connected to the internet, can get on the browser, stream music, browse fb, but every time I try to use symptom checker the app says there is no net connection. I will increase my app rating when the issue is resolved.",
"It would be VERY useful to have the ability to save symptoms by day and time entered, and to be able to export it in an easy to analyse format. It would make it so much easier to track symptoms related to chronic conditions (frequency of migraines, effect of medication, etc). If the app would also allow to add custom symptoms for that purpose, it would be great. Would get 5 stars if there was this option to save symptoms to analyse them later or send them to the doctor by e-mail.",
"Was fine before I had to update my phone but now after numerous installs and uninstalls, it didn't work at all! It won't start up, just stays on the start screen and acts as though it's going to start then the start screen pops right back up again :\ used to be such a useful app but now it seems to be defective :(",
"I am consistently getting an error that reads ""Failed to loan necessary content to run application.  Please try again"". It then gives me 2 options, ""try again"" (which makes the same error recur) or ""OK"" (which causes the app to close).  I have not been able to open the app at all.  I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it multiple times, but problem persists.  Any help would be appreciated!",
"I always liked webmd. But seem they are for getting that men are here to. Chronic Pelvic Pain In Men,the app. Has it for lady's,but gentlemen are out of the question. And they have not much on RPF RETROPERITONEAL FIBROSIS.  With can cause men to have Chronic Pelvic Pain In Men,along with sexual problems. Come on WEBMD",
Fell in love with it the first time I used it. Thought I was dying... it was a severe inner ear infection. Seen my doctor he gave me the same diagnosis. He said web MD is very accurate... but you should still see your doctor,
"Loaded quickly on my Micromax A110 but went into an endless loop after loading the splash screen . Ditto with Medscape. Had to uninstall both. Presently awaiting a working version. I hope the Developer is listening. Rgds, Dr Lavanian MBBS",
It is ib an endless loop when trying to start. It deleted my google search widget beware of this app. Uninstalling. I may bookmark the webmd website.,
Just rediculous. Waited 10 mins while loading and geesh never even opened. Then had to take out battery to reboot phone.,
"This app is okay as far as getting information on certain conditions, (if they're already saved in the app). But some conditions are not available which makes the symptom checker limited. The symptom checker only acknowledges conditions that saved in the app. I expect more from an app like WebMD.",
"Great idea, but seriously, a mild headache is typically not a symptom of a brain tumor.",
I like the apple version of this better because you can zoom more on the body. It's kinda hard sometimes to touch a body part without mistouching another.,
I can't get it to even load and open. It goes back and forth between the home loading screen and a white screen.,
"Whenever I am worried about a medical issue, a non-emergency, I look up the symptoms. It helps me decide if I need to see a doctor or not. You can never replace a doctor, so go if you're having serious issues, but this can help with symptoms I don't understand.",
Thanks for making it free. Would have given 5 stars if it also suggested natural remedies rather than just drugs.,
"I have this on my little Samsung Dart phone and think the information and interface are great, but I would really like to install it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7"" tablet.  Unfortunately, the Play Store says it is incompatible with my tablet.  Can you please make it work for my preferred device?",
will not load it just flashes occasionally but does nothing else. i have uninstalled twice and no change,
Same problem as everyone else. Keeps launching/aborting startup page. Very unhappy...,
"I use webmd for all the medical conditions I have and the different medications I have to take. Naturally, I save it all. Well, now I can't access my saved information. FIX it please!",
"I have the Kyocera Rise w/ ICS on Virgin Mobile. Downloaded and it didn't work. Waited a week to re-install, but same homescreen and aborted launch over and over. Optimized for ICS my azz",
I've had this for months. I guess I'll keep it for emergencies. At least for a little longer cuz the Web MD website doesn't work well on smartphone,
I agree with other comment made from the Droid RAZR. The app does the same thing on my phone. RAZR Maxx,
Has all the medical info in the palm of your hand. Has been very helpful with specifics on particular illnesses. A must for parents.,
This is a great app. It gives  u 24/7 help in finding the right diagnosis on what symptoms you put in.,
Stops responding after a few minutes and completely locks up my phone. I have to hard reboot,
Failed to load necessary content to use app. Plz try again. That words always appears at the first time opening on Samsung galaxy tab GT P3100. So wasting my time using it. Actually no star for this app.,
"Great app, but other apps have health news. This feature was great and I don't understand why you got rid of it. I would also like to see drug dosages.",
"On my HTC Inspire, this app was amazing.  Now, on my HTC Vivid, this app refuses to launch after the title screen.  It just keeps reloading that screen.",
Refreshes logo page and doesn't load. Tried reinstalling but got same thing. Useless for me,
I am a Parkinsons patient who also recently had a heart attack. This is a Great tool for keeping track of your health and meds.,
This app is very convenient and helps me determine what is wrong with my son when he is sick. Kudos,
"This is the most informative medical app I've ever seen n used. Best thing I ever downloaded, if u have kids download the baby webMD, it's also great",
"Automatically self launches in the background without selecting the app. Eats up data, ram, and battery in the background, having never been opened by the user.",
"Looks like it could be a great app but I've never been able to sign in with my existing webmd account. Even changed my  password, still can't get in.",
Try to open and it automatically force closes. Unfortunately can't even say anything about the app.,
Doesn't go past title screen. Disappointing I couldn't use it. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still wont work.,
"Nice app, looks & functions well so far. Need food & fitness tracking thru the app for added convenience.",
Love this app. Imagine talking to your Doctor about your symptoms and giving him/her your diagnoses. This application gives you that ability.,
I hardly use this application. All of a sudden my account has been suspended due to suspicious activities.. Uninstalling....,
It needs the ability to search a symptom without having to go to the body part. Also needs psychological symptoms.,
This app has never failed me on iPhone or Droid devices. WebMD provides accurate and thorough info for medical decisions and preventative care.,
This app makes keeping track my RX's far 2 easy but 4 now that is what I need. Thanks Semper Fi,
"The app used to work great, now won't get past the 1st screen like other users.",
Despite my best efforts i could not find a named  condition my doctor told me to treat. Point being donot DO NOT trust everything in this app.,
On symton checker .. after adding two syptoms it force closes on me every time =(,
On my old phone it worked great but now it won't open on my new one. It goes to the main screen and the loading bar loads non-stop. Ive reinstalled it multiple times but the same stuff happens. I really did like this app.,
"I have used their site for a long time, but nothing is better than having them at the palm of my hand when I need them.",
Great but if your gunna make it available in other countries make sure everything works. I can't sign up And it told me the nearest 24drugstore was 2hours away. I live in Canada not that much of a difference.,
"Very informative. Some doctors have no people skills and don't explain the what, where, when, why, how of the disease. This app does though!",
Great tool for me... And a great way to answer questions that even makes sense to my 8 yr old.,
recommending this after everybody to download. hey give you a lot information that really helps and it's correct. and you don't have to pay for name of the questions that you ask.,
I really enjoy how easy to navigate this app is. It is packed with almost everything you need to know! Its personally given me peace of mind in some cases.,
Motorola DROID rzr will not get past first screen. Keeps blinking,
This seems to be a really great app for people like me who have no experience in the medical field. Easy to read and get information. I love it!,
wont even load. keep showing download simbol for hours. tried everything. keeps doing the samr thing,
Is a wonderful app. But for women it should ask if your pregnant so if your not it removes those related conditions. I just had a baby 4 months ago. Kinda imposible to have premature labor when im not pregnant anymore.,
Just needs a bit of work on the location services for this area (and I'd imagine some others) but otherwise very handy and informative.,
"I like it, easy to use. Recently started using the food tracker online, it would be great If the app had that feature as well so i don't have to go online for that.",
Amazing. I am new to a Smart Phone so this App stunned me. You provide everything anyone could possibly need. This is a wonderful tool. Thank you.,
Loaded app from store - started app up and was unresponsive. Kill the app in foreground - but app was still functioning - tried to kill cached app. Would shutdown but then relaunch. Becoming unresponsive. Uninstalling now,
I loved it when it worked. Now the Ice Cream Sandwich update ruined it on my razr maxx.,
"Would love the app but, I can't get pass the first screen.",
very informative and an App that every mature (mentally) person needs. So helpful and a MUST HAVE. Thanks so much. Thumbs-Up. 6 stars,
I don't use it that much. Maybe because it's designed for non medical people. I'm a medical student.,
It would be nice to have it in different language's for example Spanish for my friend who like the app but can't read English other then that very useful.,
"A handy, comprehensive guide to non medical people like me. Very useful indeed! Works flawlessly well with my Samsung Gal. S3.",
"It will not even open on my phone, it just reloads the webMD logo over and over. Thanks a lot",
This has to be the best app out here. It's just what I needed . Very informative and straight to the point. I also love the pictures of the pills. Can't go wrong there.,
"So far, disappointed. You only have the most common conditions in your data base. Two of the conditions I have are not there and there is no way to add conditions to my ""my conditions list"" if they are not in your list. Makes the app ineffective for me. The 2 conditions I speak of are esophageal spasms and strongiloides (a parasite).",
Just installed. Does nothing but force close before the app even opens. Waste of time and space.,
This is helpful with kids constantly getting bumps and bruises and bug bites. Outstanding free app.,
This helps me with pharmacy school. But should be available on Galaxy Note Tab. Pls. Still 5 Stars in my book ;-),
"I have diarrhea - there is no ""search"" area in mobile app, ""buttocks"" offers no correct symptoms, and I wanted suggested treatment for likely stomach flu - I'm miserable, and you're no help. this mobile site was absolutely no help. Why do you suck so bad? Wow.",
It's nice to have a medical app that you can refer too if you have like a on the spot questions or are researching some symptoms your having and it's a good tool to use before you set your Dr.,
Not able to open the file in my Note2. Had downloaded many times and again uninstall.,
Just keeps loading and loading without ever starting up. Lamesauce.,
"I have the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the app refuses to load... the logo will show up and flash every 10 seconds or so, and does nothing else.",
"This app is the best! Its good to have when something isn't right and its fun just to go on there and learn different things. If I could give it 100 stars, I so would! c:",
Good app. Just doesn't allow you to research thing in referance to your health or condition,
"Worked fine until I updated, now it won't go pass the start up screen.",
Just downloaded this app but EVERY time I open it instantly needs to force close....rubbish,
This app saved me alot of time going to the doctors or having to phone a nurse. Really informative and would recommend to others!,
"Amazing app, offers endless information aswell as solutions and its totally free. . Best app on the market without a doubt.",
Unfortunately I can't use the app because all it does is refresh the logo page over and over. I sat waiting for over 10 minutes. If it actually worked for me I'm sure it'd be brilliant.,
This app helps the normal everyday person to understand they're sickness and the medication they are taking,
A lot of information would like to be able to list my allergies.,
"when i came across this app i was excited, i use webmd a lot but i Just installed it and every time I try to open the app it force closes",
Its nice to have at your fingertips especially when you don't have a computer readily available.,
Had it on my touch and worked perfectly...so decided to download and won't get past the first screen...,
Now I can worry that my benign symptoms could be indicators of life-threatening conditions on the go! Thanks WebMD; you're the forebodingest!,
"There's No detail on biological Action of drugs. which helps a great deal on other drug and food interactions, which is also very limited information.ie. biological mechanism..., is scant spotty at best.",
I am happy that this site is up because you can find out lots things.,
If it  doesn't work go to setting then to developer option then untick do not keep activity Thanks,
Won't go past start screen. I was really excited to install it but it won't load. Acts like it but then start screen pops back up... fix please!,
"Will not open past splash screen, keeps cycling like it wants to open but doesn't it's no good if you can not open will be looking for another app half star",
"I love this app! It is very helpful and useful. It tells you EVERYTHING you need to know about with anything medical. It's like a Doctor on your phone. You can put all your medications in, anything! You can store all your own documentations in your health. Like I said a ""Doctor on your phone"" I definitely recommend this app.",
Never been able to use it cause it will not load. Waste of space.,
Gets stuck at the splash screen. It blinks but it never loads.,
Would be nice to have more herbal supplements and alternative medicines listed like on the desktop site.,
I downloaded this because the stupid website wouldnt let me look at stuff without downloading it and then it wouldnt even load up. Waste of space on my phone. Uninstaled it 5 minutes of after i got it,
I'm a motorola android user and unfortunately this app won't go past the start up page. please fix it!,
I loaded this app twice and got nothing.,
Will not refresh past the opening page.,
I love this app it gets down loaded to every phone I switch to ..I noticed it comes in handy alot,
Saw few reviews saying couldn't get past first screen but thought i would try my luck. Guess what can't get past first screen. Uninstalling,
"Before installing, check what you allow this app to do. You allow it to call numbers without your intervention. Otherwise great app",
A great app by all means! I particularly love the 'symptom checker' section of the app which enables instant access to a great variety of medical conditions and their symptoms- extremely useful for medical students! Would highly recommend it!,
"This app has saved our family over $40,000 in medical bills this last year! The best part is not having to wait in the E.R. all day! I only wish it had the ability to write prescriptions.",
Great app! I would love it if there was a feature that stores our current prescriptions so we don't have to trudge our bottles around to the Doctors!,
Awesome app for checking symptoms and getting health information. Works great!,
As the webmd website is wonderful and informative the app is also no less it dose what it claims...,
I love this app it's very helpful that you can look up symptoms and stuff.,
I used to use this app all the time. Won't load anymore. Just a waste of storage. Stuck on first screen and blinks. Fix it!,
This app won't even open on my phone.,
It also jams on loading screen and keeps flashing... i've never used this app before but decided to give it a try becasu of medscape malfunction... but it seems like its a issue the producers are not willing to fix... it has been about two months i had to uninstall medscape and still the same... who knows if they ever are goin to fix their two apps,
Horrible app doesn't even start when I try to open it!,
This is one of the best apps of all time .   This app works really well with me and my phone.,
Liked very much!so convenient and helpful. Though wish more symptoms and conditions were listed,
It doesn't work on the galaxy s2 just keeps flashing on    and off nice strobe,
"Darn thing starts on it's own, when apps start on there own they only get one star, should be zero.",
"I downloaded the app but when I go to start it, it won't go past the start up screen! Willing to download it again if its fixed.",
"Can't listed allergies, ir form a medical record.. also does list all conditions...",
This app has worked fantastic for years on my D2 global and it worked when i first installed on my new Droid4 and now all it does is crash at the main splash screen! Thats all it does! Get it together Webmd!,
"It was good the first time I downloaded it, but then it stopped working so I removed it and tried again. Now it won't even open.",
"i downloaded it and since ive tried to open it, it cradhes. i tried redownloading and same error occurs",
I try looking up hospitals and no hospitals show. Says there is an error.,
If you don't ics don't bother. Does not work on gingerbread,
Some of the screens are no unreadable because of the app's color scheme.,
Wont open. Stuck on splash screen,
"Doesn't replace your doctor, but does help you figure out what may be wrong.",
"It's just not working on my phone, I can't even get to the main menu. It blinks on the start up page continuously...please fix soon",
very useful for home treatment. some diagnoses extreme and cant be taken seriously,
Would get 5 stars if there where images associated with the symptoms.,
It would be nice if it started i get a nice splash screen but that's it would give it a better rate if it worked,
It ask for internet connection for every action,
"I installed this spp, now when I wanted to swipe the images it was not working, what is going on with this issue, please fix it",
Will not run on my galaxy s3 sucks cuz I loved this app on my infuse,
Does not work a blue screen will load that says webmd and if you are to hit the menu button a white screen will pop up and disappear back to the blue screen.,
Great app..nicely made..believe I will be using it many times. Would like it if you could choose to have you're meds and med condition for emergency use linked into hospitals.,
"Handy when I need it to: look up information on a pill, conditions, etc.",
"Overall, I really enjoyed this app, mainly because of just how much health-related information is available. The home screen makes it easy to navigate through all of the data. Users can even create an account which will allow them to save pages and articles for quick retrieval. It works perfectly for someone who needs this type of information in a pinch. One critique that I have is that it has ads at the bottom of the screen, but this is to be expected because it is a free app.",
This app does not work y,
Did not work at all on my nexus 4GS,
wouldnt even open on my samsung nexus x,
Won't start up on my device.keeps showing the start screen.uninstalling,
This sucks cuz I keep getting error signs and its taking way to long to load,
This is so helpful. Has so much info and finding out your symptoms flows so easily through the app. Love it!,

"Omgosh this is an excellent app, I use this app all the time especially when doctor change my husband meds",

Wont launch....,
I used to have this on my htv evo. I'm now using a galaxy s3 and the app won't go past the loading screen. Fix it and I'll reinstall.,
Where did my widget go? I have to go online to use Web.MD.  I downloaded and installed Web.md app. Went to use the app and it is no where to be found on my Motorola XPRT,

"Carat is constantly reporting that force stopping this app will save 2+ hours of my battery life, even though I haven't opened it since I had mono in April. I don't need an app I barely use draining my battery.  Functionally, it works fine, but my desktop computer doesn't have a limited battery like my phone so I'll stick with the website.",
"The app works.  (Surprising that there are problems on much better phones.)  However, in just a few minutes of use, I've found a few things that render it almost useless:  1) If the drug you're looking for is at or near the bottom of the letter (try Colcrys), you could die of a slow drug interaction before getting to it.  Please add a thumb so we can pull down to the area we need, or put in a sub-letter menu under the main letter.  2) If you tap the drug, and you get a server error, you're left in a blank screen.  Go back and you're at the top of that letter again.  See #1.  Fix those and it'll get 5 stars from me.",
"Good app but the symptom checker is difficult to use, the body doesn't zoom properly and you can't click on specific points. An update that allows it to work more fluidly on this phone would be good, it worked great on my old xperia x10 but not so well on this HTC One X.",
"I have had personal issues for years, and am now on the down hill side of life, double checking the doc's most important. With WebMD app it's done before i'm off the table, now not worried about the SLAB. I'm very grateful, THANX",
"Nice content, shrinks and folds to fit my screen nicely... but to apply updates I not only have to move it off my SD card to my phone- I even need to unmount my SD card first. Lame and so pointless.",
Won't open and ruined my phone. Slowed up my phone and caused other working apps to no longer open. Uninstalling. Hopefully my phone works after.,
"Good app but am unable to save my usual medication list. Overall, not bad. Definitely hope you can fix this and speed up the loading time. Use this when I am seeing patients. It helps to know what medication they are on. Five star if you fix both of these.",
I was somewhat obsessed with desktop website with this so its no shocker to me that I love this app but I am surprised at all the stuff it can store. I have a few medical issues with my back and this app let's me store all my medicines and conditions in one convenient place! Plus I can now read any article off the site at the touch of my phone. In one word....awesome!,
I used this app before and it was awesome. But now it doesn't work. Something's cent be used such as the symptom checker. Samsung galaxy 3,
WebMD has taken taxpayer dollars to promote Obamacare on its website.  They have published positive stories about Obamacare without disclosing the propaganda service they're providing the federal gov't  in these stories.  They're credibility is shot with me.  I'm uninstalling now.  Political hacks!,
"If i could give it zero stars, i would. It doesn't even let me open the application. Waste of space and download time. Stupid.",
it's like havin of doctor on call 24/7 it contains vital information that can save lives it covers diseases symptoms and treatments  from a to z everything you need to know great job I am very pleased    5 *****,
I just downloaded this app n i can't even get past the first opening screen. This sucks,
"I used to have this app and loved it, but now out just stays at the first screen and flashes every few second.",
Webmd android app answered my skin condition questions when 4 drs. could not. Now I know what my Dr. Needs to do.,
"App is fairly good but some info is very opinionated. Web links are worthless due to popup ads that will not close in mobile use. Most problematic is the ""rate us"" surveys on every link.",
Got to agree with Greg - can't see why you wish to use my personal data in this way. Uninstalling and moving on.,
I love this app its been helping figure out a lot of things plus is fun to mess around with. Only reason i gave 4 stars is because recently (as in just starting today) its been force closing on me anytime i choose a symptom that asks questions after you click it. Please fix this!!!,
"Also,very good for referencing unknown medications. However,can be easily abused for self misdiagnosis.",
"New policy allows app to store info, make calls, gps track, and record audio. Wrong move",
"The human avatar graphic moves completely to the right when clicked on, which makes it impossible to click on it.",
It is an Awesome app but constantly freezes and i have to redownload it all the time. Otherwise would be 5 stars.,
"Was working well initially, but application can't open after ICS upgrade.",
"You have no rights to my info, nor to give or sell it. Removing app asap. Disappointing you'd even go this route. Disgraceful!",
I've never reviewed a app. But this new update is terrible if will act like its loading forever,
Works great when someone in my family gets feeling bad. Works great on galaxy nexus. Didn't start a profile though because its none of anybody's business what I'm looking up.,
Very helpful app. It helped me narrow down the possible problem that was causing my symptoms.,
Five stars when you either build pinch-to-zoom with text wrapping or enable users to increase font size to more than the current maximum.,
It is stuck in the splash or background screen. Nothing you can touch or type into.,
I find this app very useful for looking up symptoms if I jist don't feel right. I wish the app worked on my tablet as well though.,
This is by far one of the most nicely done and useful apps I have ever downloaded. It is full of information.,
"Won't open. Keeps saying it did not load properly, please try again. Over and over. A working app would be great",
"I was never able to get signed in, even though I had downloaded annd registered. Tried 3 times",
"This is nothing like Web MD on the computer. Makes you pick from random symptoms, some are silly and irrelevant.",
Everyone needs this easy to navivate app. All your healthy living and health management guides in one. my employer is a very large hospital system utilizes WebMD to manage employee wellness & to encourage healthy living.,
Husband has light colored stool. Not on symptom list. Please fix.,
"I'm using this app on my LG 670S android and if u all read the terms of service, it says this app can make phone calls without u knowing from ur phone and it does it to mine. Google and yahoo mail apps do the same thing.",
Medscape nd webmd apps crash automatically. I use android 4.0.4 sony xperia neo v. Very disappointing. Shame on d app creator.,
"This was one of the best application i had, but does not work after being update to ics. Please help for us to use it.",
I can't get it to open!  I am disapointed and rather annoyied.,
Anybody with a high school education can do just as good of a job diagnosing a problem.,
I found it very useful. Brings ease to mind constantly. Would definitely recommend this app! Two thumbs up!,
Try to open a section and automatically closes. What a waste of memory space.,
"It won't open on Droid razr with ics. It worked amazingly well with gingerbread, but not any more",
I keep getting an error notice when I try to open. So I uninstalled and downloaded the app again.... Same thing! Won't even load. Very disappointed because I LOVE the desktop version.,
"Used to work, now it just flashes in home screen",
"Very few  Europe listed medication, no British BP drugs at all.  only US most made by Bayer!",
I typed in exact search that I did on mobile site (got hits) but no results in app. Gonna stick w/mobile site. Uninstalled.,
"Very easy to navigate, especially after completing the ""tour"" under the settings menu.. tiny little app packed full of useful info right at your finger tips",
"The only draw back I have found is the inability to save medications and mark them as ""allergic to"".",
Its great for both at work and with the family. Read what your being prescribed.,

Great for researching health problems with simple over the counter fix.,

Downloaded multiple times never opens,
"Iv been visiting the doctors alot because of 1 problem they never could fix, used this app, told the doc the results and got treated properly :) all GPs should have this!!!",
"The app was useful, to a degree,  but collecting data on something as sensitive as a person's health for marketing is a deal-breaker..",
They keep disappearing. Very annoying!,
It's a great reference to look things up.,
This aid a great app to have when your on the go and want to get quick info on something.,
I've have never had a problem with this app. It's so helpful and informative.,

I love this application it is very informative and it give you resources to get even more on any conditions that you are founding about.,
Now all it does is force close as soon as app opens. Used to be very useful. Unistalling,
"I love this app!  It's been used a lot in our home!  It has put minds to rest. It has lit a fire under some of us.  Most important of all, it has been educational.  Thank You!",
"should not be called a ""free app"" since you have to pay to ask a question. don't waste your time.",
Won't open after downloading! Better off going directly on the web! Uninstalling!,
LOVE THIS APP. IT'S A MUST HAVE. Helped me find out that my son had a concussion before the Doctors could tell me what was going on.,
"For  ID'ing those pills ya find lying around without a bottle, 100% accurate...so far lol",
Does not work on Razr with ICS. Freezes on start.,
Force closes every time. Galaxy skyrocket.,
"Very well design app, works GR8.",
Awful. Very glitchy on body viewer,
Everyone should have WebMD on their android phone.  An enormous amount of information.  Thanks....,
A must one for every device. Feels like a DOCTOR in my pocket. Excellent.,
"Only prob I have is with pill identifier. Used this app on ipad before but not for this, so when I searched pill identifier app I chose this figuring I'd get more use than one just for identification. Tell me if I'm doing something wrong but when I put info in, imprint, shape or color, there's no option to search except at top which is for search by name. I'll keep app, but until someone can tell me what I'm screwing up I'll go online or use diff app!",
Works and launches fine. Galaxy Nexus w/ AOKP Android 4.0.4.,
Downloaded 2days ago - already proven itself useful.,

Greatest App Ever!!!!,

Very useful,
Awesome!!!,

"This app is easily one of my favourite out there.   The pill checker is the greatest part: it will identity ANY pill out there, and it gives important information about it including what pills you can take with it, OD information, and possible side effects.   The symptom checker makes one quite the hypochondriac, but its as accurate as any computer could be. It told me I had appendicitis long before I called the hospital, and there's no way I would have caught it so quickly.   Easily 5 stars.",
"I enjoyed this app very much. Nice, quick, and easy to use. The only reason that I gave it four stars rather than five was that it didn't have every type of illness, ie: avm (although it did have some 'illnesses' that I thought had no point of being in there).",
"This app is far more informative then one would think. It's like having a PDR and a treatment guide all in one. If you find a pill and don't know what it is, you can be assured that this app and its features will not only identify it, it will provide you with all the information you need. As a career Paramedic, I find it an invaluable source of information in my profession!",
Pretty good app. Would get two more stars if it:  1) supported horizontal view on the phones screen. Have to keep it vertical.  2) actually was able to search by imprint while in Pill ID. Feature and search bar is there but no search button to press. Same on wifes and friends phone which are different models and carriers so not just my phone.,
"This is a great app but I think it would be better if you got a button that would let you select how long you have been having your symptoms, because I have had a stomach problem for over 5 years now, and when I put my symptoms in little things come up like flu and food poisoning blocking other long term problems that I could possibly have.  It would be much better if you added this feature, thanks for the great app. =)",
"I am unable to sign in with my WebMD account on this app..In order to utilize the ""save"" function you have to sign in with your registered e-mail and password used when registering with WebMD.  OK, I suppose if you don't want to save your med's, articles, etc. After contacting WebMD, they were not able to figure out why I can't sign on using my desktop account.  Droid X, WebMD version 3.1  Update: As of 3/27/12, I have sent two e-mails to support, each time I supplied info they requested and I have not heard back from them?  Terrible support indeed, no help at all.  I have uninstalled, reinstalled, emptied cache and data and still won't allow me to ""sign in"".",
"On my Samsung Galaxy Nexus it will open to the loading screen with the tree and then stops working and it takes me a while to be able to get out of it. I won't uninstall yet but will wait for a update that will hopefully fix the problem. Same thing happened with Kindle and the update made it work perfectly, so hoping the same will happen here.",
Great app.. I use it often with 3 kid and my elderly parents it has come in real handy. I was able to get my mother the correct care after her doctor sent us in the wrong direction. It may have help save her life. For that I thank you for a great app.,
It lacks alot of general symptoms like nausea or vomiting. You can put down 2 symptoms and it gives you a list of about 16 different rare serious illnesses that have symptoms that dont even match the ones that you entered. Uninstalling,
"I installed this app initially for checking up on things for my 6 month old son...but there is NO info on infants, including fever charts. Disappointed, but will keep the app for symptom checker for adults.",
as soon as you try and open the app it freezes on the front page and flashes alot and nothing else (GALAXY S2 WITH  ICE-CREAM SANDWICH SOFTWARE),
"This app is so much more convenient than having to get online, wait for page to load, search for symptoms, medicine, articles, etc etc...all from your phone. Now, all I have to do is click on app icon & off I go! Its super fast, not to mention easy, & I absolutely LOVE that I can save info/pages I may need to pull up again later on & access it so easily!! Much better than having to bookmark webpages & searching through everything to find it! This is truly a wonderful app & I recommend it to everyone! :)",
Wouldnt even open after i installed it then fc after being open 2 min. If i could i would give zero stars.,
"Meds missing, pharmacies missing, doctors missing. Not at all user friendly. Will more then likely uninstall and find some thing else to replace it.",
"Doesn't drill down nearly as specifically as I would have hoped. Not so useful. Also, the input progression is confusing at first. Meh.",
"No longer opens. The app goes to the loading screen, flashes white briefly, then returns to the loading screen in an infinite loop. Tried un-installing and re-installing, but the problem persists. I'll definitely update the review as soon as the problem is corrected - hopefully it will be with an update to the app.",
On ICS and doesn't boot. Seems to have a boot loop on the WebMD picture on boot. Get a blank screen and back to pic.,
As a dental professional this app is handy to quickly look up my patients meday and review possible interactions. Very reliable source of information.,
Symptom checker won't let me tap on any body part,
"Would of given 5 stars, like app alot. Need to be able to save meds to multiple lists. Like for my parents/kids etc.",
"A lot of common symptoms weren't available, and it seemed many day-to-day ailments or conditions were excluded in favor of more serious diseases that were barely related to the symptoms. Uninstalling.",
Couldn't open and always displayed an error message.  Just trash.,
"I love this app to say the least. I have multiple conditions, take multiple medications and see multiple doctors! This app helps me keep track of it all. It also has great and useful information ready for me to explore and learn!",
"Love this app. Was spot on when I looked up the flu. Then went to my doctor,and that was exactly what it was. Great app..thank you.",
"I was hoping to be able to read the weekly email (slide show) with the Android apps, please add with no login.",
Have had this app since march and have done many updates but Ive never actually used the app. It always gets stuck on the webmd welcome screen :/ Goodbye!  Galaxy S2,
The app doesn't load...it just refreshes the loading page over and over. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still doesn't work. Real bummed because it was a nice app.,
It is an OK app but when you try to put in more than one symptom it gives you limited symptoms. Not everyone has limited symptoms!,
This app sucks... Always receiving an Error message and force close... I did the report several times and it still wasn't working.,
"The best medical app in the market, gives a very comprehensive information which is easy to understand, a user friendly app Asda well..go for it chaps",
I have two children and this app has been a life saver as well as a money saver on doctor visits. A must have for parents.,
"but needed the space so removed it.  It left a bunch of files on phone when I uninstalled it though and I can't delete the folder because of ""hidden"" files.  What a nuisance.",
Symptom checker is useless and gives irrelevant results. If i look up cough i shouldnt see results for kidney disease.,
It has the basic information but needs to be more polished for a smoother experience. I'm ditching it for iTriage for now,
Not very helpful if you're already in the medical field working as an educated medical professional. I guess it would be beneficial if you have no medical knowledge whatsoever.,
"Why do so many of the latest Android apps insist upon inserting themselves into system memory, several times per day? I mean apps which seemingly have no business doing so. WebMD is yet another example of this annoying trend. I'm sure the dev has a logical excuse (faster boot-up, most likely) but so what? I'm the phone's owner and I don't want apps sucking up OS resources for no apparent reason. Further, I hate ingratiating hacks & code-trickery designed to make things appear to run faster/better/smoother. Within the limits of practicality, I want full control...that's EXACTLY why I switched from iPhone to Android. Listen up, devs: when I want to use your app I will click on the dopey icon, Ok? Meanwhile, keep the damned thing turned off - don't look for updates, don't phone home, don't scan my files, etc. Are we clear on this? kthxbai",
Just never works on my nexus s 4g the load up web MD blue screen just keeps flashing every 3 seconds please fix developers... once fixed will be 5 stars,
I downloaded it to my galaxy s II and it made my phone freeze and never even loaded...,
"It wont let me use the app, it says to try again every time.",
Comes in very handy. I have 6 kids and anytime something if wrong I use this app to check symptoms before rising to the doctor,
I love this app. As a PSW I find this app to assist with my job. I can identify any pill. And also check on clts diganoisis and learn more about it right at my finger tips!,
"Downloaded it, tried to open but got stuck at opening page. Can't back arrow out. Have to click Home button to get out.",
Put in 7 symptoms an it gave me 15 possible illness's. Completely unhelpful.,
"Though it's by no means all inclusive, this app is a tremendous tool to collect your thoughts before talking to a doctor.",
"I just started using the app again after about a year, and it is even better than I remember! Always improving WebMD and providing a wealth of information.  Thank you.",
The app does not allow you to store dosages and other pertinent info to be used in an emergency. Itriage does a better job of that.,
Constantly has to foreclose can't finish any thing I try to do,
have uninstalled/installed three times. when loading will do a whole bar and then 2/3 of the second and freeze there.,
"This application has been incredibly useful in my profession. Particularly the med listing and pill identifier. The missing star is due to the fact that not EVERYTHING can be here and sometimes the pill id won't work with too much info. But I am very, very pleased with this and it has indeed been a life saver.",
"Can't get this program to work on wifi or mobile at all.   Despite trying at least 20 times to get it to work,  I repeatedly get a can't connect to Internet message and can't close the program without killing it with a task manager...",
the reason I dl'd this was to look up supplements.... isn't included in the application.  weird because drug information is included.,
This app is awesome! It shows every possible symptom & condition wrong with your body. I love it & recommend it to anyone!,
"It would be cool if there was something reminding you to take your medicines. Other than that, totally awesome.",
"Could use some tweaking, but I really like this app so far. I get a ""failed to save"" message when trying to save conditions though. Would be really nice to be able to save a list of symptoms too.",
It told me I had Retinal Detachment when I had been to two doctors who passed it off as an eye migraine. I ended up requesting a retinal specialist who confirmed this app's claims. A free app was able to tell me what $100 in doctors visits couldn't.,
I like the app overall but I would like it to have supplement info like the full site does.,
Use this all the time from my pc. Havent updated til now when i saw the contacts feature was removed. Tyvm. Now at least justify making calls in the description or remove that next.,
The symptoms are way to generic... I couldn't even find one for being sick at my stomach!,
Very easy to use and well laid out.  Would like to see any future update allow adding the dosage and frequency in your  personal drug usage list.,
Cant put more than one symptom w/o app force closing. Epic 4g,
This ap is awsome how eveer it takes up way to much space,
What I love about this application is it does what it says ie it narrows down symptoms so you can make a good educated choice as to what the problem may be. Top App,
"Loveeee this app. From wondering through it at night, to searching some symptoms I'm having. Very informational.",
I am all about making sure my son and I are happy and healthy. Even the littlest skin rash on him can turn serious. I am on the go and need to find treatments to prevent major issues on the go. This app is great because I find what I need fast!,
"Would be perfect if there was a search option. It also keeps force closing whenever you try try to look at ""conditions""",
I click on a topic and it sends me to something completely unrelated.,
"Missing a couple conditions but still great, hope they're added soon",
All these apps that charge big bucks and do nothing close to this.,
This application is very educational in giving information on various medications and medical conditions. Pretty easy to understand. Also helps you keep track of your personal health and medical information .,
This really comes in handy for me being a EMS/fire professional. Im also planning on starting nursing school soon so I use this app all the time.,
"A bit too simple but there is beauty and elegance in simplicity. Also, simplicity does not mean it is not thorough.",
Causes a forceclose everytime I click on anything other than symtom checker,
"Will not search generic drugs on many different brands or show correct picture.  On A to Z search always wants to start at the beginning if you hit the wrong key,very upsetting girt!!!!!!_",
Wonderful app! Its a shame you had to remove abilities because people are too stupid to learn about what those permissions meant. Maybe one day...,
"I had this downloaded on a different phone, and I loved it, disappointed this time, wouldn't open. Reinstalled and still did not open. Please fix, I love this app.",
You can't find common conditions or how to pronounce some medical terms. This app sucks.,
"Crashes Evey time it loads,  IF it actually loads. Galaxy nexus with ICS.",
Got worried at first because it wouldn't load. Closed app & when I reopened it works great! This phone is awesome! I love my Android :) great app!,
"Don't be put on hold for ""ask-a-nurse"", your life is more important than to spend precious time listening to elevator music. GET THIS APP! Very quick access to acurate information, very little space used. Your personal health file at your fingertips to send to any doctor, any time.",
Won't let you do anything without giving your zip code. I'm not American so I don't have a zip code.,
The app is nice but it crashes everytime I use it. I have a Samsung Galaxy SII.,
"Terrific application, but....where is the version that supports Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich. App needs to be updated to support new platforms.",
Didnt have what I was looking for. The information was on its website but not in the app,
I installed the app and it will not go past the WebMD start page.,
When you try to click on the are of the guy that is bothering you it doesn't work please fix,
"Problems entering info., wont accept e-mail address from pc account.",
"Very good information but ""no results"" on searching for pharmacys or hospitals in UK.",
I love to have this as a quick guide for symptoms and health conditions on the go.,
"Each time i go to pick a topic, it gives me an error message. It makes the app completely useless and frustrating! !!",
"I 've never seen an app that took so long to install and could do so little. Scrape that, it could do precisely nothing except stall.",
Good app but the icon keeps removing itself from my home screen.,
"as a reg accnt user on comp, I love the versatility availale online & in addition to symptom chkr I also use the weigbt loss section and customised weight loss plan which is not available on mobile app.. please add that !!!!  i'd love to use it daily with my calorie counter!!!!",
"Seems like the content isn't fully integrated into the app.  I see some links are available but many 'next step' markers are not linked.  For example, it might say see article on xyz for more info, but there is no link.",
The Body symptom checker does not work on my HTC sensation.,
"The only problem I've run across is when using the symptom checker, the diagram moves whenever I try to click an area, causing to select the wrong place",
"Not a bad app, could be useful in certain situations.",
Help me alot to fund the geberic names for brand meds... love it,
Great app to help give you a preliminary diagnosis of your symptoms.,
Won't accept a UK postcode and without it most of the app is inaccessible :-(,
Nice app! Has come in handy many times! I highly recommend this app. It's not intrusive and does not slow down my phone. If you have a 3G phone it might slow it down but this is worth it.,
This has some really helpful medical information and videos narrated by Dr. Oz. Well done! It even counts compressions for giving CPR!,
Wont load just flashes web md then a white screen back and forth,
But it keeps force closing on my Galaxy S 2. Please fixed and I will give a 5 star rating!,
Stuck on welcome screen. White flash every 5seconds and it repeats,
Have decided to uninstall app because the newest update wants the ability to make phone calls and other permissions I deem unnecessary and invasive.,
"I used to have to get on my computer, wait for it to load, ect. Ect. Now with 2 babies this is by far the easiest way to check the seriousness of the sympthoms they or I have. 5 stars. Amazing!",
Worked great the 1st time I used it. Now it won't even let me open it,
You can get alot of info from there. I love it!,
Can't log in using mobile app on Droid razr. Setup up account online and tried to log in from phone using same info. No button available to log in. Only button is to create an account which I already did. Does anyone test these apps first?,
Very useful..lots of information and it helps to review some diseases,
I actually like this app. It takes getting use to but its as helpful as their website.,
It won't open at all. It says it didn't download sufficient content to run...after I downloaded it four times. I even erased some apps in order to free up some space j.I.c. but nothing worked. Definitely not a working app!,
Just stays on the home screen and freezes I need to force close GRRRRR,
"So thankful for this app. Saves me a ton of time, vs waiting for a nurse on the phone.",
"It would be nice if there was a general search box on the home page of the app. Otherwise, I love it!",
"I loved this app, but it won't allow to to check anything, its saying that there was an unexpected error and I had to force close. I'm kinda disappointed.",
"Please add additional pill information like OTC supplements, strength and time taken.",
Good work web md. Expecting updates. Also it got.freezed.while startup and then begin working...fix it up :),
Saying failure to receive information when I click on app.,
Symptom checker seemed unresponsive but general search of illnesses proved informative,
"‚Ä¶ for civilians. But, should never be used instead of calling EMS for life threatening conditions.",
I have a lot of medicines list and I always check this app. Loved this and this is way best app and faster.,
"Boots, then immediately says 'Failed to load necessary content to use application. Please fix! T-Mobile myTouch LG-E739",
"Drug list is great, but needs dosage taking and how often. This would help with Dr Office visits. Dr/Hospital/Parmacy listing needs updating in the Space Coast Fl area",
Love this app I use it daily...due to the nature of my work ethics... Always learning from Web MD,
"I suffer from allergic rhinitis, and symptoms can be easily confused with other respiratory disorders.... because of this app and remedies mentioned in it... I am better informed and have a better health just as web md says....:)",
Just letting those who wrote this program that there are other places in the world than the usa,
Love it. It's very accurate and helps me out a lot especially being a mother of four kids :),
Liked it until it kept force closing even after repeated reports.,
Good info and like having a place to keep medical info. Wish I could also store doctor info too.,
This apparently is fast as lighting and is just like using your computer at home. Great job!,
This app is so great.I Started feeling sick and it identified it as bronchitis.I'm much better now. It told me what I should take for it and it worked. Download this app right now. You wont be sorry.!!,
For some reason i cant install it i get an error msg,
Just keeps reloading the title screen.,
Rly helped me understand what I was feeling and what I should take. This is a very convenient app.,
"It is webmd but I was looking for all options, isn't that a HIPPA requirement? I saw D.O.s listed but wanted to find a D.C. as well.",
A very useful app. Work seamlessly on sgs2. Great work! Kudos to the developer!,
"Works fine.  I sideloaded the app on my Vizio Vtab, works without issues.  not sure why they wont allow download on tabs?",
What's there is great but I wish the food and fitness planner was included.,
There are other countries outside the US...or didn't you know.,
I use this app often. I work in the medical field and find this as a helpful tool to have.,
Very handy for avoiding unnecessary trips to the doctor,
Hard to sign in and no remedys for what ails me...,
"Superb application, I got perfect knowledge about medicine and first aid.",
I love this app dont always have to call or run to hospital.,
"The more I use this app and the more I learn about it, the more I like it!",
So helpful. It is better & less expensive than going to the doctor office.,
Just flashes on and off...nothing,
A must have medical app for pro or home!,
"I have loved WebMd for awhile! And now that I can take it with me, I love it even more!",
It stays on the start screen.,
I open it up and it loads and goes white and it goes back to loading. Nexus,
Great app! Very useful. The slideshows never work though.,
"I would have loved to see what this app was all about, but it just sits there on the loading screen... Ugh... So lame! Pls fix ;) ty",
"Installing WebMD on your phone may just save the 1 you love! Even a tiny health crisis is certainly worth 10 seconds of install time, don't you think?",
Amazing app comes in handy when you have no insurance ;),
Won't load past home screen.,

"Please read the app description to get an idea of why this app needs certain permissions. Read contact data in order to email contacts info from the app. Write contact data in order to add hospital, doctors, etc to your contacts from the app.   That being said, this app feels clumsy. I feel the vast knowledge of webmd is here... Just wrapped in an unattractive shell.",
"Very smooth interface and functionality. Will definitely recommend to fellow Android users. Overall, an excellent job and a satisfied user!",
"Great app, shame they had to remove functionality because of stupid people. Now all you retards need to fix your reviews.",
#NAME?,
What's with the permissions on this app. Disappointed. Removing immediately.,
Force closes after update (DROID x).,
Excellent app especially the last update. The developers must be top notch.,
Awesome app but you please make available for android tablets with honeycomb.,
Would be better if UK post codes and hospitals were added,
Awesome support. Thanks!,
Great must have app,
"Why do you need access you my contacts?   Too bad,  I was using it at work!",
So you removed the ability to save to contacts because a few morons who can't read complained?,
Useful app. SGSII,
What's new? Nothing in there about needing access to my contacts.,
Very handy to have!,
Very useful!!,
This site is awesome,
Useful app,
"This was a great app until this update...there is no possible rationale for the developers to have access top my financial days, contacts, fine location and all.  I'm really disappointed and uninstalling immediately.",
"Tried many times to use this app and every time, it would just freeze on the opening page. I waited several minutes at times, and still nothing.",
"Does not accept presses on body when using sympton checker. Other than that, it works but does lack a lot of symptoms.",
"The great Dr Cox said it best. If you hear hoofbeats, go ahead and assume it's a horse and not a zebra. Advice that the WebMD team didn't take, because they delivered me one heck of a zebra. For my symptoms I described ""mild joint pain"" in my ""left leg"" and the only answer it gave me was ""Shingles"". (In reality, my knee is chronically sore. No shingles here, just good old fashioned joint pain)",
"Wish webmd showed age relations to diseases, also stages of illnesses. Other than that I find it very useful",
WebMD for Android is the best.  I. Find it the best and most informative sites to date.  All the work that has been put into it.  Keeo up the good work!  I'll see what you have to say.  I have a couple more questions but will keep them for tomorrowm. Thanks for all your help.  Talk to you in the am.,
This is a great app to have if you have health issues and you need answer. It has help me a lot with my heart attacks I have had and I did not understand the words that the doctors were useing. Thanks webmeds,
"I never take time to rate apps but this one is absolutely bad. Very disappointed, I expected much more.",
This is a must have for people with kids. I use it all the time for info about illnesses and injurious my kids have. Not for hypochondriacs.,
"Force closes and then tells me it cannot connect to the internet, even though I had wi-fi on and was in my house.",
"4th install, fine for 2 weeks then needs force close. Keep uninstalling then reinstalling and still messes up. Unhappy.",
"The tap a body part feature doesn't work, also scrolling the a-z list using the faster side button scroller doesn't work. Pictures could be handy too",
So I loved this app when I first got it. But now it just force closes and is not worth jack on my HTC inspire.,
"Seems to be a good app, but it doesn't even list postpolio syndrome. People out there are living with PPS and nothing is listed here.",
More than what I imagined. Showed me possible conditions I had by showing the part on my body and symptoms. Shows pics of pills and more.,
User interface and typography is great. And such wealth of info without a cost is even more wonderful. Grt work,
"While I'm sitting in the hospital, thought I'd test it out. Very pleased with the answersand the layout of the whole app",
its a  pretty good app.  great for ppl that just have normal healthy  lives with regular med  probs  here & there,
Very helpful. I use it to find out what might be wrong with me or a loved one or just learning purposes.,
"Good for checking tablets if you have lost the info, quite good symptom checker, and quick first aid help. Excellent app, recommended for all.",
Helps you get an idea of what's Wright with you l. Good app for what web MD is.,
Would love to see this app with personal prescriptions and alert with expiration/ and interface alerts for doctors appointment. Add dental search prov,
It should have the weight tracker thing on android.. thats what people really need.,
Like to know..Former medic with of medical problems. Nice to keep in the know,
I just downloaded this app for my android. Love it. It says mist everything. This is a must have app. Check it out. You wont be sorry.,
It helped me with symptoms that my grandson was having also gave me much info of things to look for with medication. Thx great app,
"I just installed this app and love it... but the new update is forcing me to uninstall. Stay out of my phone book. Was going to rate a 4, I'm glad I waited now. 1 STAR!",
"I love this app,it gives you all of the information that you need.Now I don't need the other prescription pill apps.I am very pleased.",
Another application uninstall because of permissions. Stop catering to the add companies or I might a well go back to a dumb phone and save myself a couple hundred bucks a year.,
"Brillant app, so good that I got symptoms for appenditis and thankfully had the op in time and now on the road to recovery.",
"Everytime I try to move passed the first screen, it closes. :/ I'm hoping this will be fixed soon. I think it would be a great app.",
I use site and information for all parts of my life. Great app for men health.,
"Uninstalling because it opens Dialer everytime I want symptom checker. Galaxy S, I9000",
"I am an RN. I find this app. Very useful in many aspects of my practice. Quick, easily accessible accurate information. A+++",
Thank you for being good devs and removing that permission. Now if only LinkedIn would listen to it's users,
Be careful accepting the permissions to this program. It is not worth having this app to risk the security of you and all your contacts on your phone. Many apparently are becoming more intrusive as time goes on.,
The very first thing anyone does on WebMD is type in the search bar. Wanted info on coffee and can't do it.,
"Very efficient as an app. Quick, helpful, as good if not better than the website. Droid Incredible",
It needs more symptoms. Mine are so common but their is no symptom for it. Ill just ask my mother.,
This app doesn't allow you to look specific problems like the actual website does. I wanted to look up blood infections but the app could not find it in the search tool.,
It's not a bad program but its not upto date with the UK and it needs to have some more options on locations to refine your query,
Its amzing how the emails i receive are exactley on point of what im dealing with! Its really odd as i swear webmd has a video camera in my house! Lol,
"Can't find info I need like on website, essentially making app useless. Looks pretty, but symptom and condition search needs a better search method.",
This app is a life saver. Will not substitute for seeing a doctor but it has helped me with minor health issues I've had to deal.,
"Bad permissions, there is no reason to have all that info on us! I loved the App before but now its getting uninstalled",
"My wife used this website all the time and now that there is an app, I can use it on my phone without having to search and search just to answer Q's.",
"Great app it works great and is very easy to navigate. Comes in handy, i like it (LG Optimus T).",
Add to Contacts in Additional Features section explains why app needs access to Contacts.  Still should be highlighted in What's New.,
"Best app yet. I can check any syptoms/conditions from any age and gender, from trusted sources.",
Saw my doc after 3yrs of dealin with SEVERE back pain. WebMD told me possible rupture or herniated disk my doc found a partial rupture in lower back,
"Just wish the search had more info, even it it transferred u to the web. No problems with the app at all!",
"Important a nurse so this is fantastic to use when i am unsure  of things, down load all u nurses",
"Easy to use interface with simple step by step ""wizard-like"" instructions helping to guide the user towards an accurate diagnosis.",
Upon startup it begins to load then the progress bar freezes at  about halfway. Uninstalling.,
I used this app to key in my daughters symptoms and it was right on the nail about what she had and what to do. I like it.,
"C'mon now guys, there's a ""what's new"" field for a reason. Many android users are techies and aren't afraid of a little explanation as to why you require contact info for your app.",
"I didn't find it as easy to navigate as I expected, but still a good tool.",
Helped me figure out what was going on with my heart. Still waiting on results of the heart monitor I had on for 24 hours. BTW I'm only 16 years old.,
"There is no need for this app to see my contacts. I'm sick of this kind of crap! Uninstalling... Dave, if they want to email friends why not just use the Sharing intents API like any other app, let gmail handle the email.",
Great app except when I go to slide out my keyboard and use it the app doesnt rotate. If it did you'd get 5 stars. Droid 3 user.,
"Sorry,  new permission request just forced me to not upgrade!",
"Symptom checker is a plus, who needs docs when you have wemd ;)",
"It use to work now it wont do anything but stay at the loading page....if I could give it no stars, I would",
"Heck,WebMD keeps me on top of things exactly where l want to be,thanks WebMD.Elbuzo",
"I was excellent since the last update it force close, too bad for me I always used it whenever I felt sick Samsung Vibrant",
As an RN I strongly recommend this useful and informative app. Cant beat the price either,
"Idk why you wouldnt have this. A must have, cause you never know.",
"Great medical app, though in symptoms and on the body it does not include the throat.",
"Force closes constantly. Uninstalling, just going to use website.",
"I love this app! I am a nurse and whenever I have a question, no computer handy, I juss hop on my phone and check and I have what I need. It's great!",
"Found exactly what was wrong in less than a minute. Awesome app, 2 thumbs up",
No reason for all those permissions or contacts.  Not updating!,
"Very nice medical database for fact finding and general patient oriented research. Force close issues. I would like to see a ""Save Patient"" function.",
"Liked old version! Not user friendly! Trying to look up conditions my wife is going through! IE: UTI, VRE and Anatheshia types!",
"It does force close if you have kernel 2.3.4 but it does work for the most part, normally only conditions tab closes app.",
Would be appreciated if Canadian locations were available.  Site & info is fantastic on my Android.,
It sucks unless ur a nerd trying to learn worst app,
...which is important if you're trying to respond to a medical problem. I appreciate that the first aid information is all offline. Great field resource.,
"Great app! Works seamlessly on my DROID Pro X. Just like the online version, the mobile version is awesome, I use it often.",
When searching for local physician by name it doesn't allow name to be saved/used for search and often forces close.,
"My doctors should use this app. It's very thorough and always up to date, (unlike my doctors).",
"I love this app. It gives detail info on many health problems and info on medications. I a a fan of webmd, thanks for adingto android smart phones",
A must have. Learn about health or even look up your symptoms.,
"but now I'm convinced I've got cancer, lame",
Force closes everytime I try to use it!! Fix it please.,
"Good info, function & layout; however I have to reinstall daily because it just moves to SDcard & shortcut ceases to function (greyed out).",
Uninstalling - The permission requirements of this make it unusable for me. I just want a simple medical app...,
Like what ever so like handy sometimes but now like not good poor,
Speedy  information on those worrisome symptoms when you're out and about.,
Excellent!!! Quick check of past symptoms led to correct diagnosis. Found all local drugstores and hospitals. Highly recommend this app.,
"...the app needs to be a bit more polished, i.e.: some caching logic and the possibility to bookmark diseases or symptoms.",
"I cannot get this to even load up, after multiple tries,uninstalling",
"Database for doctors and hospitals where i live is inaccurate and lacking. When i tried to email them about this, it came back undeliverable!",
"There are no questions showing up in the question section, so pointless app unless fixed.",
The symptom checker is limited. Please add all common symptoms.,
What is going on with all these apps wanting to know all our contact info... Is this 1984? Give us a break and stay out of our personal lives!  Will give you a 5 when you cut the crap!,
WEBMD :Is a great resource. You will find a wealth of medical information provided by well respected medical experts! I highly recommend it.,
This app used to be great but no longer works on my Infuse. Keeps on force closing! Update please....and it will be worthy of 5 stars again.,
"Does everything that it should, I used it to diagnose my back hurting and it got it right!",
A waste of time it never even opened for me to use it,
Easier then using my phone browser to view the website. App seems to work well.,
Ok everytime I use this sight it always comes back as a rash or a std but when I go to the doctor its nothing,
Many conditions cannot be found.,
if it would open without crashing immediately I would let you know how good it is.,
For the classic hypochondriac...really very helpful and detailed.,
"Very valuable information in app, but cannot be moved to SD. This sucks!",
Downloaded app and it doesn't even open. Not happy.,
"I simply love this, had it on my home computer, now I have it with me everywhere I go.",
Keeps forcing close will not g ive conditions,
"Great for diagnosing problems, looking up info on illnesses, ckecking out medications, and more! I use the WebMD all the time and now on the go too.",
"Best place to get up to date information, and news about medical questions and issues...",
Very informative. Works perfectly fine on my Infuse.,
Very useful for everyone there's always gonna be a reason to use this app.,
Always handy and updated. Got answers much faster than searching the web.,
Love the website so I got the app... I'll give them 5 stars when the put an articles tab... I love the articles,
Forced close each time I try to review symptoms.,
Very helpful. Love the body image display and the capability to save my info.,
"Impossible to enter basic symptoms like, ""skin rash on arm"".",
Slow to load and symptom selector has poor responsiveness,
It don't work on my Android Ascend.,
Gets stuck in start up screen. HTC EVO,
Great app!!! It really helps narrow your search down and gives great information!!!!,
"Do you require all you do just to use the app? Its none of your business or concern to spy on us, the government does that enough!  Switched phones needed this app but I refuse to consent to yall spying on me anymore than Im already spied on by our crooked government. When did Americans become the ""bad"" guys cmon",
"Great app gor everyone, too assist in all medical asspects.",
This app won't completely download. Ridiculous.,
Won't work without sd card.,

Great app to have when having health issues,

Crashes my htc launcher can't even open.... htc incredible,
Great App!! Easier than going online,
Great checker of a problemwhich gets u to ask questions of your Dr.,
Very good app but would prefer an offline functionality,
Couldn't find staph infections or anything about mrsa! uninstall!,
When you try to press first aid and a few others. Used to work great now its just a crap app. Samsung infuse.,
Best reference MD app on the market. Bar none- Mytouch 4g,
I love using this app to get information I can't get from dr.,
Why do you need my contract info? I Will not update and I will uninstall if not explained.,
Just installed. Great app. Luv it & works great HTC Inspire,
Has helped me out with aches and pains,
"HTC Thunderbolt, works wonderfully great for moms",
keep crashing all the time,
Why do you need my contact info. Delete.,
"I am a nurse, and this is awsome. True and accurate!",
For all with HMO and Obama new health plans,
Very clear and not buggy at all Droid x,
Easy to use and easy to get information quickly,
Valuable Tool in Helping To Making The Decision To Seek Medical Attention,
Excellent for finding out about what ails ya!!,
Not a good app.,
And they read change logs and check permissions.  Why the need to access contact data?,
This is a great app if you have kids.,
"Frustrated can,t load update why",
This app has all information that's handy. Excellent work,
Great app for drug and medical conditions research,
So fast I like this app. Very intuitive.,
Force Close on HTC Incredible when I click on First Aid section,
"geared toward women and the pill Id is worthless, thank goodness I am smart enough to double check or my father would have taken the wrong medication",
Helps a lot and good when I'm bored,
"..works good, pill identifier although is super slow even got a ""wait/force close"" box...but good otherwise",
Probably not the best app for a hypochondriac lol,
Great app helps me with everything I would recommend,
Love it! Absolutely awesome for any & all medical questions & pill Id's!,
I'm a CCRN and use this a lot. Love it!,
Great app! Highly recommend!,
This app is very helpful to me Easy to use I recommend it,
I will advice all nurses to have this app. It is great,
I'm a nurse & I use WebMD all the time. Even before I became a nurse I used it. It's very informative & so simple anyone can use it for help.,

Not opening properly on stock but updated droid x. Other comments seem to confirm this again and again. Unfortunate and uninstalled.,
"very handy precious updates downloaded on ur mobile pad by android market sw ,really time saving and value for free always.",
Difficult to maneuver on symptom checker figure body. Hard to know what was clicked. I have to tap screen 10 times just to get it to click.,
Cannot load this or Medscape after loading medscape and it upgraded. Really disappointed as use these two sites on my computer almost religiously.,
The only medical app I have used that answers all my questions. I can see my Dr. and be more knowledgeable and have more input as to my health concern,
Theres a lot of info available but i was hoping for not jus the usual stuff... like the ability to search for something instead of having it in set in,
This app is great for checking symptoms and finding treatments. You can also look up drug information and have access to tons of great information.,
I've had somewhat of a bad knee for a few weeks from me bending down and feeling my knee pop. This app thought my knee pain was herpes shingles. Wow.,
Love this app. It helped me get better when I felt sick. Awesome must get app. Mytouch 4g,
"Disappointed Web MD has not included Stevens-Johnson Syndrome in the conditions, as immediate recognition of symptoms and treatment is key to survival",
Everytime I click on the symptoms it always force closes and says I don't have an internet connection even though I do. Please fix this. Thank you.,
While using it it stopped working and froze my phone. Uninstalled! I don‚Äôt want something that's gonna stop working and freeze my phone.,
Nice if it showed urgent care listings. Says closest clinic is 8 miles. Know there r over 10 between here and there,
"This is the best when you need information that the emergency room won,t give you. HEY WEB MD GOD BLESS YOU. AND THANKS.",
"Gud app but it's so hard to select a body part, just keeps moving the screen instead. N1 CM7",
This app is informative and useful like website but not emergency like iTriange. The ui is clear . Would be 5* if it has move to sd support.,
"Wow. What a great app. View yo medical conditions, treatment, pathophysiology and more in simply english. U jus gotta love this. 5 stars frm me.",
Very Nice to see web MD on the android platform. I only trust web MD for online research of medical problems.,
Not at all smart at diagnosis. Eg slow onset elbow pain and it suggested broken arm. It also could not find am open chemist near me(in Australia),
"Although it looks great at first glance, when you try to read further than the first page it takes you to the web, and not a mobile site.",
I love MDweb when i found out i couls get it on my cell it was even better. Has everything you want to know.,
"Uh not as good as the website, just link website to home screen and save the 6.56MB space :D",
The only thing that works is symptom checker. If I try to do anything else it force closes.,
To broad or vague in the descriptions. Won't allow 4 items like strep diagnosis.,
I love it. It helps me as a mother of two with a lot of health issue that they get or have. Keep up the great work.,
"For those who weren't able to open this application try to go to settings on your phone, then manage applications, find webmd have it move to phone",
"Says cannot install to SD card. Never saw an app that tries that on its own, but I've moved many to SD after install. No idea what's wrong, but no go on Droid X.",
While believing I had diabetes.. found out I was pregnant. Thanks web md for not having specific enough options to choose from and scaring me,
"Had used it for just one symptom, but the result and the detail were astounding for a layman such as myself. Shows great potential.",
Not as informative or useful as the site. I can't even click on the body for symptom checker or add multiple symptoms. HTC aria,
Very easy to use and good for common things but rarer conditions are not covered. Would like to see all the features of the website on the app.,
This apparently is very helpful. Everyone should download this. You never know when you may need quilt information 10 stars,
It would be better if you could also see the HOME page like on the web page. I could not get rhe info I wanted on the app that is provided,
"Its okay for convienant info on the fly, but not as good as WebMD site itself -- not as complete",
Won't work on HTC incredible. Open app and status bar gets stuck about 1/10th of the way across.,
Sadly another application only for US market. No UK hospitals listed or European drug names,
Links to other conditions should open up in app rather than opening in the browser... otherwise nice app,
Wow! What a fantastic app. Those people at Web MD really know what they are doing. Everyday health is lagging in their app development I guess.,
It's so easy to use and full of vital information. This app is a must have for anyone and everyone. I'm so glad it's free. Thank you.,
"Pretty useful app, despite slightly awkward UI. But can access on the web and save space on my phone",
"Works really well, but as usual it's blatantly US centric. Please make it location neutral or make choices other than just the US.",
This app will not load on my HTC Evo and the developer email does not work either so I'm posting it on the comments please fix.,
"Outstanding app. I want to thank you for drawing my wife's attention to this. Now she has every disease, pain and illness listed!",
"DROIDPro: start app, start/splash screen appears and then freezes. Tried to start a number of time. UNINSTALLED",
"Mainly for US people. Scroll issue for single letters. And you need internet, less than ideal.",
HTC having trouble residing page. Works as a symptom checker but have to go to website separately to use anything,
sprint EVO 4G stupid app doesn't want to load waste off time to download.. UNINSTALL,
This app is extremly helpful! I use this way more than expected. I love the symptom checker and the feature that finds any kind of doc in your area.,
"Good app overall, but be careful using the pill id - i've had a couple of false ids with it (generic lamictal id as adderall, for ex)",
D steals the best app for diagnosing things that may be wrong with your body love it 100 percent.,
The best medical reference app I've downloaded. From pill ID to the symptom checker this has everything I need and it's fast too. A+. Evo,
Wouldn't work on HTC aria. Couldn't click body parts on symptom checker just moved the dummy.,
Opens. Screen fades a tad and app becomes unresponsive. Nexus One with Cyanogen.,
"This app is the worst waste of my time ever! If you have the Motorola Charm android phone, don't even bother. You're better off without it.",
Really like the app! It gives added info that my dr. gave me but I forgot or info that let's me make good decisions on my health.,
"This is so much better than going to website, which was frustrating to use on a phone. Straight forward and what I wanted, plus more",
Great for searching medical conditions. Only thing is it always link out to browser instead of within the app when I press on the linked terms.,
"Does not pick up local services from my location, but does have good library of symptoms.",
Please support Virgin Mobile LG Optimus V - the app freezes on the intro page.,
"Wow the first symptom I checked on brought me to exactly what I had, excellent app",
No bad. Actually very helpful and will save some doc visits and money on doc bills. Love it!,
"Useless it needs internet connection even then 6+mb size , Itriage is the best ..",
"Eric, u can put it on ur sd card, might have to do it manually tho. Haven't tried app yet so hoping other neg comments don't happen win I do.",
I dare say this app is complete. Couldn't ask for any thing else,
Update review: problems I reported earlier were fixed with a simple reboot. Turn phn off/on after installation for smooth running. Nexus One - stock.,
"The first time I looked for an image of a pill, it said there were 7 images, but it displayed 0.",
"Would LOVE to give it a better rating but force closes upon opening app, EVERY time! Please fix - HTC Sensation",
"I was really looking forward to try it but It freezes, it wont open, in my droid HTC :(",
This app sucks webmd internet website more informative this app is not helpfull at all don't belive 4+5 stars its the dev rating his or her app,
Was so excited to have this but it force closes on anything I look up. HTC aria :( please fix!,
Very nice app . But i wish if there is an offline mode' would be perfect like medscape,
Privacy policy seems very confusing and doesn't separate the app from the website,
5 stars if Canada is included on the listing but it's not.. Please include Canadian listing on your next update if possible,
Great app. Allows me to check things before unnecasary trips to the MD,
Overall its a great app. Wish you could search by symptom and treatments would be nice,
"It's easy to use, but I had to force close twice when I first opened it. Also there isn't a place to find info on vitamins or supplements.",
"I've downloaded this app twice, but uninstalled immediately because it will never open; the loading bar just freezes in the middle :-/ AndriodSamsung",
"Great app very useful, however i have gotten a lot of 'force close' messages please fix",
Seems like a good app but totally drained my battery and I couldn't run anything else.,
"Very impressed with this app. UI is well designed, clean, easy to navigate, interactive features, tons of resources. Perfect for mobile lifestyle!",
"Provides accurate information, the pill identifier however does not work well at all but all the other features seem to work fine",
"I now am self diagnosed with 30+ diseases. Thanks, WebMD!",
This is a good app to have for yoursefl and school. I look up every med that I take and my family,
"Great application, but does not upscale well for high-res screens.",
Stupid! Can't even recognize oxycontin when you describe it perfectly. No INFANT CPR. Fail.,
"If you enjoy an app that force closes, then this is what you want. But personally, it drives me crazy!",
"I had this app...and actually was enjoying it until I ran a daily scan on my phone and it came up as a ""High Alert"" so I immediately UN- installed!",
Will not open on my Optimus S...so I deleted it. Luckily I have Medscape & iTriage downloaded. They both work great.,
"Great ap! Too bad when u get it, 50% of the time u need to get online.",
One stop for all things about living and staying healthy! This site is a phenomenal resource...thanks.,
"First place I go, before and after the Doctor. (And no more yearly lugging home the PDR, which is already outdated by the time I get it there!) TINA",
why the most of android app are online mans we have to connect internet all the time to access app? m give this app 4star only because emergence part is offline and i think its huge effort of webMD to offline emergence portion of that app.,
It gets to the home screen then does nothing else. Worthless since it cant be used.,
Good job. Thanx for doing it right and not throwing together a crappy version for android like some others do.,
Saved a ton of BS on my SD card and is very slow. Uninstalled,
FC'd on first time I used it! Hate the iPhone-ish interface. Otherwise a fine app,
Just found out I have two not so good conditions.,
Droid 2 best app i have found for matching symptoms and finding medications. Also easiest i have found,
This application told me exactly what was the problem... WEB MD is a great resource for quick resolution...,
Great App. Crazy people thinking WebMD is tracking them makes me laugh.,
"Whoever does have a problem to open this app, get a better phone & u will see the quality of it. This app gives u an overview about any medical issues",
"Never would start, only flicker after it attempted an update. Removed as it wasn't functional. DroidX",
HTC Hero eclair app just hangs at first screen. Uninstalled,
This app is great and has all of the terms and facts that I would look for since im in the health/nutrition field,
Clever but not inexhaustive list if ailments. Covers the important and more common ones.,
This app gave me the knowledge to ask the right questions! Hypocalcemia confirmed! Thanks!,
"Cool app but doesn't rotate the screen, so I end up using the web anyway.",
We'll laid out easy to understand and very easy to navigate strongly suggested everyone. Should give it a try,
Have been using the main website for years and now there is this excellent app for my Samsung Fascinate. Thank you!,
Oh my god it says I have herpes and a second head.,
Very precise and informative symptom checker. Probably easier to use than the actual site!,
Locked up phone had to force close and power down to get phone back Motorola milestone,
Either ridiculously slow to load or will not load at all. Samsung galaxy s 2.2,
Loads main menu but any further it force closes. Nexus S,
"Freezes if I touch the screen when it loads up, other wise, it's pretty useful. Droid x gingerbread",
Stopped working after a few days and froze everything ok my phone,
Completely missing in the app and I can't understand why.,
App just flashes the screen. Worthless until I can actually use it!!! Droid X,
My heel was hurting. The only selections was sole of foot or ankle. I could not find a way to find the heel and tendon that attaches. With a few more inputs it would be an exellent program.,
Best app everyone shuld have it..you just never know when or what is going on in ur body,
Cannot get it to work on my HTC Incredible. Just shows a picture and nothing else.,
Body checker using human body has trouble clicking on areas of body.,
"Symptom checker is all that works on my infuse...other than that, forced restart",
Im so glad webmd is out for android I've wanted it since I switched from an iphone.. thanks!,
This app is better then medscape. It's pretty liam decent. HTC evo 4g,
Freezes and does nothing. Needs its own doctor.,
"Doesn't load past the splash screen, Droid incredible",
a very nice and informative app but wish it had more things to show and explain! more updates needed! eats too much battery!,
Works great on my EVO. I like some of the features better on this app. then on my other med apps.,
Only problem is it alerts that its your turn to play when its not your turn,
"Failed to work on my Galaxy S (Android 2.2). Spash screen, then screen dimmed. Uninstalled. Now waiting for V1.1",
"Love Love Love this app.! Easy to use & love the fact I can check symptoms as well as Rx'es that have been prescribed to me! AND, IT'S FREE!",
DOESN'T WORK ON MY HTC SHIFT! PLEASE FIX THIS SORRY EXCUSE OF A APP!,
One of the best medical apps around! it really helped with all the explanations and details.,
"Great for non-professionals, not good resource for professionals if you need dosage info for meds",
Disappointed with info supplied. Trying to find info on rash and the only option available is diaper rash. Really? No tech issues tho. Froyo 2.2.2,
It would great if it would change direction with my phone so i could use my key pad,
This app requires a lot of personal information to be useful. Make sure to check access requirements first.,
Installs a lot of files on phone and is very slow!! Uninstalled. Droid X.,
Very handy especially when you need to know some medical problem on the go..,
Great app! I have been waiting for this one a long time. This app trumps all other medical apps. Period. Thanks webmd!!!,
Great app. First one ever that I haven't a single complaint! I love it!,
Pure trash.Pill Id is a joke.. narcotics such as vicodin and oxycotin along with Ibuprofen show up as no drug found.Are you kidding me?,
I was able to triage and diagnose myself with precision...awesome app!,
"Great for nurses like me and if you get caught texting at work you can always say... ""I was looking something up related to my patient's diagnosis""",
Graphics jump around. Poor diagnosis. Galaxy Tab,
Needs some work on medical listing searches but other than that it works fine.,
"Installed just to comment: Why does a medical app need permissions to make calls, access my phone book and discover my gps location? Ridiculous.",
Keeps crashing when trying to look at a symptom. HTC hero.,
Great usefull app. Love the layout design. Very user friendly.No problems with it at all using HTC Evo Shift.Thanks!,

Use it all the time! Works great on my HTC EVO,
"Looks promising, but lots of ""force close"" looking up drugs. Droid Eris",

"Thought this would be a more mobile friendly version of the website. I was trying to read a particular article on my phone, but could not get past the first tab. Could not even pull up that article in the app. Plus you have to create a WebMD account to access many of the features.",
The app is slow and constantly crashes and has inaccurate information. Only reason I downloaded it is because the website wouldn't let me use the online symptom checker and kept rerouting me to the download page even when I said I didn't want to download. Fix the site to allow mobile access without the app and stop making apps. Your programming department sucks.,
"In fairness, never used much and searches were clunky with same results for different things. I don't know why the app wpuld add 50 image files randomly to my photo gallery.  I kept deleting. May Re add app if I ever had a med question",
"One of WebMD's coolest features is the database of information on vitamins and supplements, which gives a nice overview of the state of the evidence (or lack thereof) regarding safety and efficacy.  This is absent from this fairly basic app.  Additionally, the app itself is pretty poorly developed and lacks UI polish.",
"You can't use the symptom checker via the website if you're on your phone, you are forced to download this app.  This is very annoying as space is at a premium on my phone, and I MIGHT use this app 2-3 times a year. So since I HAVE to download it, I always have to uninstall it once I've been diagnosed with cancer....  Urg!",
"I downloaded the app because I've had jaw pain in the hinge for over 2 weeks. I give the description in the correct area and it gives me 15 possibilities. None that match the symptoms I have. It was a waste of time. Probably a good app for someone who has a bruise or scrape on their knee and is too stupid to go get peroxide and an antibiotic or some kid who contracted herpes at a party, but otherwise useless.",
"So I go to tbe websit to check my symptoms, then it refuses to let me move forward until I installed this stupid app. Then it keeps forcing close and when I FINALLY got all my symptoms entered it doesn't give me any results. Why couldn't I just do this through the website to begin with. Useless, and a waste of my time.",
"I love the website. ever since I got the app, it's been very useful whenever I need it at a moment's notice. I have referred several people to it and will continue to do so. My favorite part is the symptom checker. This has allowed me to take care of issues without having to run to the doctor every minute.",
This app is obviously run by people who don't care if their users are happy. There have been comments since the beginning of September saying that this app is not working correctly for the Droid RAZR.  What is the point of an app even existing if it is being run by a bunch of screw ups? Get it together. Technology is constantly updating and becoming better. You are lacking in that area. Keep up!,
"On the plus side, you can instantaneous and detailed reports on medical conditions. This is all great, but Web MD is a for-profit site. They sell information like your browsing history to the highest bidder‚Äì including, say, your insurance company. All I'm trying to say is be cautious.",
"Why ask immediately. Why don't you give a person sometime to get use to the application, without the pressure of every half and hour ,your could you please rate us. . If some just downloaded it they want to search read and get information. Not fill this out during reading the symptoms and writing what to say to your breathing specialist.m, not fill out a little survey before they really know. Please listen to me you would get better ratings if give people time. They downloaded you app for reasons.let them get some answers before this   Rating system. Which  I did because I know what you do and maybe just maybe we can be treat as people not counting cows going to a Slaughter house.Thank you.",
"I absolutely love this app. So useful for my family. Helps with understanding your health and diagnosises. As a chronic hospital avoidant type, this app not only helps me with better self care habits, but also encourages me to seek medical attention when it really is needed, rather than minimizing the health conditions I do possess. However, there is certainly room for improvement within this app. I would like to see this app allow multiple user profiles to be created, personalized, saved, and stored. I feel a more interactive interface would result in more personal, informed, and ultimately the most accurate suggestions regarding the existing health concern based on medical history, hereditary illnesses, and lifestyle of each individual. Overall, this is an extremely helpful tool, and I can only see it growing and improving.",
"I love this app. It is nice to be able to plug in your symptoms, and have and idea as to the culprit. Sometimes you don't always know if your symptoms warrant a doctor's visit or not, now you can make a more informed choice on whether or not you should go. I do want to say though sometimes trying to find the right symptom can be difficult.",
"Excellent tool to store medical diagnoses,procedures&medications for when you need to recall personal data at appointments,urgent care emergencies services. Web Rx assist with letting you know if it's adverse reactions/meds don't work well together.  And The Pharmacist told me it wouldn't be a problem but it was. Then I was able to notify my doctors about the problem. Web MD also explain in detail assisting what the doctor may have said and things to ask the doc. It's team work and keep notes because you know your body. Just listen to what it's telling you.Doing your part in taking care of you is a fill time job. Your doctors will appreciate your efforts.",
"I don't usually get medical advice from the internet. Because everytime I check on the internet (even a common bee sting) I always ended up with a really horrible diagnoses. Then I ran across the Web MD app. I use this app multiple times a day everyday. The WEB MD app is a resource that gives advice on treatments, as well as educating an individual on their condition. This helps with communicating with doctor visits, etc. .",
The app is the worst app I have found on here. It is f:::ing lame. It won't except your users name.if they won't except my users name. Then why in the hell don't they just pick one for me. Damm how hard can it be . Your app needs to be in the trash.just like others that didn't have much thought behind them.,
I went to get information on my wife symptoms she had before she ended up I.C.U the other day for pnaumonia and this program says she only had asthma.  Good thing I went ahead and called 911 instead of telling her she only has asthma to just relax sleep and don't plan on waking up.,
"Since I Installed (then rapidly uninstalled) this dreadful little app, I've received spam email after spam email, which don't stop even though I've used the link in those emails to unsubscribe from all of their mailing lists (all of which I was added to without the app bothering to ask me first, btw). The app itself isn't up to much and the unending river of spam emails from WebMD that followed means I'd strongly recommend that nobody else ever install it.",
"Very nice App!  I like the medicine info!  I like the ease of looking up a new or existing medicine that I take and looking at what they are supposed to do, how it's done and side effects.  I sorta obsess on knowing about what I am putting into my body.  Also like the ability to look up medical terms so I know in normal human English what a medical term means or is.  That is the only thing I think that could stand to be expanded.  Cover more terms.  But all in all, I love this app!  Thanx guys!",
"I use this app often. My Dr. finally figured out what was wrong with me, I have been sick for years. After many Dr.'s and medication it is great to be able to look up useful information and or identify a pills. Especially when you have to take a lot of medication.",
"This used to be a good app. It has made the symptom checker harder to use 
with symptom lists that are repetitive in some ways and lacking in another. 
It asks for preexisting conditions but doesn't have a good majority of 
conditions, including asthma which is a well known condition. The 
medication list doesn't have the majority of medications available for 
selection either. Overall it's trash. It feels like it is now trying to be 
more of a medical calendar than what its original purpose was, to be a 
symptom checker. I don't know who they have editing the symptoms list but 
they aren't doing a very good job at it. Don't bother wasting your time.",
"I have just installed web MD and was asking a question about my symptom in 
writing. While writing, the keyboard popped up hiding my writing. And also 
lots of ""add symptom"" things popped up. I didn't need to add any symptom. 
Then I got lost. During review writing, the keyboard kept popping up. So I 
was unable to finish my review. Anyhow web md is a terrible app.",
It will not let Me get into the app cause its saying that it could not put the information on my sd card so I can view it. Even though I've already managed my apps and deleted a lot off my sd card to get the info to go on there. I even reinstalled it.,
"If you're a hypochondriac or or have Munchausen syndrome. It's very vague and is designed to lead you around a candystore of possible ailments until you give yourself a panic attack making assumptions that you're either dying, or even worse, crazy because nothing really matches. Let me sum up... It's a dartboard with diseases on it. Put on a blindfold and have a blast if that's what you're into.",
"This app helped diagnose my wife's ""Endometriosis"" when a couple different drs had no idea to think of that... and now we know what she is hurting and suffering from and can get start her recovery process after her surgery! So yes this app is highly recommended for me and my family!!",
I had this on a different android and  it worked perfectly but I got the galaxy s3 and now it won't load past the title screen :/ that bummed me out cause I really enjoyed this app. Please fix it and ill give you guys 5 stars :),
"What the heck were they thinking? They took a useful tool and turned it 
into a hysteria monster. No more questions narrowing down the range and 
location of your symptoms, just a jump to the worst case. ""Sure, that 
stuffy nose and head pain could be sinusitis, but what say we ignore that 
possibility and go with something more interesting like leprosy and 
cancerous nasal polyps?!""* *And no, I dont know if that's what it would pop 
up as a result, but it's just as ludicrous as the results I got for what I 
was looking up. TL;DR Avoid this app until they make it useful again.",
"If you are a hypochandriac, DO NOT download this app. I just came back from the hospital because I was sure I was having a heart attack. EKG, IV and xrays came back fine. And it all started because I had some gas pains and started looking into it too much through this app.  However this app works well enough for what it is",
"Just got my new galaxy s3 and Installed this. Upon running it, it just sat there on the opening screen flashing every few seconds. Now I need to find something else that's similar",
Among the first lines it says updated to work with ICS. I have ICS 4.0.3 and it's telling me NOT compatible! Is there something else I need to update or will it just not work with this version? Loved the app on my older device would give 5 stars if I could get it on my new device!,
"People with real health disorders such as my Phenylketonuria, should not use this app. It will not help you separate disorder and possible illness. Data base is so generalized that it can't even identify Kuvan. I guess I'm better off going to Med school, than trust marketing majors to tell me whats wrong. Does webmed ever source check, or even staff a MD?",
Can't do anything if you live outside of the USA. I am in Canada and it won't let me make an account or look for info because I don't have a Zip Code. Would love the app if I could have access to it,
Never had a chance couldn't sign up. Turned down all my email addresses. Same thing with WEB MD PAIN.. Kept on telling me not on line. Even though I was able to get on everything  else. Deleted both apps.,
"Horrible, horrible app. I read through the reviews after downloading and uninstalling it once because the start up screen would appear and just keep refreshing. It seemed like it was a hit or miss,  some people had no issue while the rest were complaining of the same issue so I downloaded it again. It did the same thing but this time also some how managed to delete all of my text messages!!!  :( Beware.",
"Trying to hurry to look up symptoms, however, can't look up multiple symptoms at once. App isn't easy to figure out and when you're dying because it feels like your head is going to explode you don't exactly have time to figure it out or squint at directions.",
"Please fix this. I just opened a Webmd account and I would like to use this app on my phone. Only problem is after installing and uninstalling numerous times, it still won't let me open and kicks me out. I have a Samsung Galaxy SII.",
"Very informative. I now have had recent scare in December had pulmonary embolism and went into cardiac arrest TWICE and ended up back in ER January 8th passed out could not give me reason why I passed out. Have to follow up with cardiologist and neurologist asap, might have to wear heart ‚ù§ monitor for some time. Started having heart ‚ù§ issues in elementary school I am now 34 be 35 this year.",
"Inconsistent with performance. I will add symptoms and get conditions, then come back later and add the same symptoms, but I get a result of ""No Possible Conditions"". My solution to this is to reinstall the app, which is pretty annoying and inconvenient.",
"I haven't used it yet, but I doubt that it will be a useless, inefficient application. I can use it for myself and someone else.",
"WebMD makes my life so much easier. With 2 kids, getting an idea of what's wrong with them before freaking out and rushing them to the nearest hospital or their doctor, saves me time, gas, and a lot of frustration.",
WebMD purposefully went and disabled my Adaway adblocked device. This is crossing the line in what a medical info app is reasonably expected to do. It's a big no no. I will stick with iTriage although that app has its background services problem.,
"It told me that my right lower back pain was caused by a broken shoulder blade? No thanks. I didn't want to download another useless app on my phone, but the website kept pointing me toward the app for checking symptoms. I immediately uninstalled after the broken shoulder blade diagnosis.",
Great apps. Provide full pack of info that will help professionals and non-pro people with regards of their health issues and problems.,
"Always used to use the symptom checker, now you have to have the app to do it (-1star,) it took 4 hours to download 8 gigs on 4gLTE...(-2stars,) it doesn't give you the option to look up a symptom via text (-3stars,) and the UI could be set up a lot better (-4stars.) Sooo disappointed with webmd I used to use them a lot but now I have to have a terrible app I probably won't be much longer..",
"I downloaded this app after going to their website. The app was of no use, I simply was looking for treatment of croupe but there was no search option. I uninstalled immediately.  It also froze three times and had to foreclose once.",
I was hoping for a mobile version of their food and fitness log because the one on their website has been such a great asset to me but it's not here. The app is not really worth it for me without that...,
"Googling symptoms has better results.  Also if you hit the wrong button, it deletes your symptoms   making you start over.",
"Still the best app ever for medical UPDATE, 9-17-20: This app no longer works, due to ads that can't be cleared from the screen. It takes 2 minutes of button pushing to finally get to the desired result. Not worth it. Uninstalling.",
"There's no overall search option. Doesn't give you the freedom to move around like the webpage does. Restricts movement, extremely frustrating. Downloaded for food and fitness planner, not available on app. Only on website.",
"I downloaded n when i went to setting to put my info. Name,age,address etc it tells wrong data so i cant open the app am stock",
This helps me in my household and to keep up with my parents health. Then I'm able to point out what's going on. Great app.,
"I have a family with one illness after another. This app helps me know when it's minor or we need the ER. Very helpful, informative & comforting. Thank you.",
"Honestly, I only used it one time due to my boyfriend feeling really sick one evening.  I tried it hoping to help him and treat the symptoms he was having.  I DID find it to be very informative and would reference back if needed.  Hopefully, we won't be needing too often.  So, for now, I think I will uninstall it to free up some space on my phone.  They did a great job putting this app together to help find possibilities from a person symptoms.  For that, I'm giving it 5 stars.",
I also don't appreciate the Web site constantly trying to take me to the app when all I want to do is do a  search.,
"Don't you think it's sinister that this app has a Feb. 8, 2013 update to ""fix"" the ""Don't Keep Activities"" protection built-in into Android's ICS operating system? That just gave credence to a Feb. 22, 2013 review here -- that this app hijacks memory space from your phone's root. And, FYI, any cache files written directly onto the root directory CANNOT be deleted by any Android cleaner. Good luck removing those UNAUTHORIZED files. Uninstalled!",
I think that this needs more of a question system to see what something could be.. like question 1 what hurts then a series of questions after that. Then a list possible causes.,
Found absolutely no information printed on the column got solu-medrol iv on any of the information choices.  So NO help at all with my problem after my infusion.  Uninstalled,
I was disappointed the app doesnt have anything about weight or fitness like it.does on the website.unstalled.,
"I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT APP FOR ME.  I SUFFER FROM OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME SO I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE GREAT BUT WHEN WHEN I TRIED TO REGISTER FOR IT, IT WOULDN'T ACCEPT MY UK DETAILS.  HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM?",
I would have been better off getting my laptop out. You can only zoom in on the body diagram so far. Makes it very difficult to choose small areas like the nose or ears.,
"Very Helpful. I use WebMD often. It gives me clear, concise and understandable explanations to the questions I have about IBDs and the medications used to treat them.  We spend many hours with physicians and WebMD helps me understand what is being diagnosed and prescribed.",
Worked perfectly well on my Samsung Galaxy. Would have given this a 5 star rating if it worked on my Nexus 7.,
It worked great until it spontaneously put 50 picture into my gallery without my knowledge. An entire album of just logos and medical images similar to textbook illustrations. I instantly deleted the app after that.,
"Because I try to avoid most western medicine, this app works perfect for me as s basis to begin investigating my aches and pains. Its interface is easy to use, and its just all together helpful",
"Every time i tried using this app it just kept regarding the logo... FIX, than it might be useful.",
This is only for trying to figure out if you're sick. I thought I could use it to track fitness goals for Walgreen's but it doesnt do that,
"While screen presentation was excellent, the rest of the app required the user to know pre-determined terminology for searches, conditions, etc.  Even the Sign Up process was tightly controlled.  I tried different screen names which appeared to meet the stated criteria with no luck.  If the app developers want control this strict, maybe they should just ASSIGN the user a screen name.  Overall... I was very unimpressed.   The app has been uninstalled.",
Another app that won't work on the Zte warp. Can't get past the loading screen and I let it sit there for ten minutes.,
"I wanted to know if I was having the stomach flu or what, so I put in my symptoms and it told me I'm having a panic attack. Or nearsightedness. Either one. No thanks, web md.",
Usually accurate. I contact my physician if I'm sick or hurt before going to an emergency room.,
"I use the symptom checker alot and I liked the other version better. This 
one is harder to find the right body part symptoms, and they aren't all 
listed. Also, adding my medications is a great idea but the system could

It keeps adding weird random pictures to my photo gallery. I'm going to be forced to uninstall if the bug isn't fixed.,
I love the drug interaction check. The symptom checker seems quite inaccurate though,
It helps identifying possible issues based off your symptom and area on body. Very useful,
You have a headache? It's most likely cancer. Your butt is itchy? Aids! Possibily HIV. You're sneezing and you have a fever? Most definitely cancer!  Sigh.. while the app works well the symptoms checker is not helpful and puts fear into people making them.think.that they're dying.,

Not a bad app but a lot of times it's slow and you have to do things numerous times to get through it. I do like being able to look up different medical conditions and medications though,
Love it! It works just as well as the website and it has everything you need to know all on one page. So you don't have to look through a bunch of different pages and decide what info to believe,
My 7 year old had foot pain and all of the conditions WebMD gave (including Mad Cow disease .)  sounded like she should be rushed to that hospital. Went to the doctor and all she has is growing pains.,

I hate it it doesn't work for me because try to sign up its for USA not for Canada users,

It never makes it past the intro graphic on ICS. REALLY needs to be fixed.,
The body could be a little easier to click. It's kinda glitchy,

I literally just downloaded it & it has forced closed every single time that I've tried to open. I haven't gotten the chance to play around on the app because it keeps force closing. Uninstalling not now but RIGHT NOW!!!,

Droid 4 and it will just stay on the loading screen acts like screen will change then go back to loading screen,
I'm always asked to provide the meds I take. They're all here. I just open the app and pow! Not a problem.,
With each new phone I've used this app. As one of My fav.  Do I give it 4  stars.  It's easy and helpful.,
Slow loading w/h play store on WiFi.,
I'm using the calorie counter and food tracking on the website and it would be great if i could update from my phone,

Downloaded this app to check symptoms that my son has and it does not even open up. Screen just keeps flashing so i uninstalled it and reinstalled it to see if that help but it didnt. Not good!,
App keeps crashing and self uninstalls. Can only open it when first downloaded.,

App will not run on HTC ONE M8,
Could not get anything to save went to another symptom checker,
Sucks forces close:probably wrong phone who knows.,
"Just shows main webmd startup screen, so much for optimised for ics 4.0...",
I think this app is great. When your freaking out about something it gives you a clue!,
"What the description of this app does NOT make clear is that it is for Americans to use, and is not designed for the UK! When trying to sign up it asks for a zip code with only numbers no letters - deleted!""",
But..you've got too many permissions..Why the hell do you need to control my phone settings... I switch off vibrate..right back on..only since I reinstalled this app and gave it another chance..because  finally updated!! Samsung G-Nex 4.0.4 ICS used on Verizon...Would have been nice to have an app...Get rid of permissions. I will pay!! For now Website. Ty,

Installed several times same results errors and full shut down,

Just terrible. Drop down lists of symptoms that are far from exhaustive.,
Use it all the time for any problem can't beat that five stars,
"It won't load up the information likebthe overview, symptom after you do the checklist",
Takes too much time to load .,
"Any help right,in looking sometimes we have an answer,but I appreciate help getting more,help deciding,,to ask or not to ask,to hurt or not to hurt",
You can put in all the symptoms that apply to you and then it gives you a list of possible illnesses you might have and it also gives you the symptoms for the illnesses that it shows.,
Wish there was a symptom checker that could give u one condition for alot of symptoms,
You can find what you're looking for very easy I love this application thank you.,
"I give this app a lot of recommendation, the only way it would improve is have symptom checks specifically for pregnant women, but other than that, perfect.",

Awesome just need to fix some minor bugs and make it more optimization,
"I medical spondge and  I love it,i wish it would save your symptoms tho",
"It could have a link for better visualization of the site content, like slideshow and quizzes",
It's alittle out dated. Some links have no information at all.,
Now I can find out with a push of a button what might be wrong!,
I can come up with better answers in my head then this app can do,
"I have bronchitis, you were right.",
"From a medical standpoint, this app exists only for hypochpndriacs.",
"You need exact wording so instead of sharp pain in abdominal, you need 
exact wording like abdominal pain, upper right, sharp. Not happening... 
Bring back the body and the questions it was dummy proof.",
Is there a way to download the complete database of the app so that we can use it offline...,

This app has no real helping properties  Everytime I've attempted to check on something I never get a real answer or my symptoms are not listed,
"I can appreciate the accuracy, and the knowledgeable advice. Get it you love to use it, along with common sense.",
Helped me ask the right questions to my doc. Saved my life,
Walgreens had instructions on how to set it up but the very first instruction of pulling down menu in upper left corner of app did not work as Android version has no menu in upper left and menu in upper right did not have option mentioned.,
"WTF, app is not compatible with ASUS Transformer Tablet.",

Use this app to check and understand symptoms before going to the hospital.,
Pretty good ap. I also get the opnion for an actual doctor as well. App is user friendly and quick,
Won't work on my phone. It starts loading & then freezes.  I've tried uninstalling & reinstalling it but to no avail.,
If you put in one symptom that might be a symptom of something serious it lists the serious one first without asking anymore questions.,
"I want something where I can record what I am taking/doing (meds, foods, beverages, actions etc) be reminded to take/do them and be able to record (and monitor and track progress) what impact different doses or foods or actions etc have, to better manage my symptoms and improve my health and well-being. I dont think ANY app actually does this. Wish I could invent it!",
"I just recently updated my app and it was working perfectly fine before that.  Now no matter what I put for a symptom, it gives me ""No results found. "" is this a bug that needs fixing?",
Won't log in. Invalid user but asks for email.,
It tells me it failed to load necessary content and cannot open.,

Won't even start up... Just freezes at the opening screen. Very disappointing.,
"This piece is just one of the best I have come across. Please, keep it up!",

Really helps with my big family..With 5 children someones always getting hurt..,
"The Health guidelines. bave a go to understand your health now n future, latest updates.",
Optimised for Samsung Galaxy Tab2 they say. I can assure you that is not the case. The screen does not automatically rotate and stays portrait.,
I used this app for myself and lil girl and it helped me save money from going to the doctor by being able to treat a sickness myself.,
It's good when one wants to know more about ones illness.,
I've worked for lg health care system.  Doc I worked with had high regard for this app.  Great.,
I couldnt check my symptoms because it wanted my zip code UNINSTALL,
