"Well made game that is fun and has some learning to it. My daughter loves to play it. My biggest issue is that there is too much non-educational play between the learning about the body and the facts that pop up go away too fast. She will see an interesting fact and want to tell me about it, but it disappears and she can't remember it enough to tell me. It would really help the facts stick if she could tell them to me. Add more education into the game and I'll let her play more.",
